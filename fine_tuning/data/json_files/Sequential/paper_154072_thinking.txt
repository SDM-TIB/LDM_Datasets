To extract datasets from the research paper titled "App-Aware Response Synthesis for User Reviews" by Umar Farooq et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their system using a "large corpus of reviews and responses from Google Play." This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the paper, the authors state that they collected data from "103 popular apps" and gathered "over 3.4 million reviews and more than 570K review-response pairs." This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors provide further details about the dataset collection process, including the criteria for selecting apps and the preprocessing steps taken. They mention that they crawled apps with at least 25K star ratings and at least 100 developer replies, which adds context to the dataset's relevance and size.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **Dataset of Reviews and Responses**: The authors collected a dataset consisting of over 570,000 review-response pairs and more than 2 million user reviews from Google Play for 103 popular applications. This dataset is crucial for training and evaluating their proposed system, AARSYNTH.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is a product of the authors' own research and not a previously published dataset, I will note that the dataset is available at their provided GitHub link.

The citation for the dataset would be:
> Farooq, U., Siddique, A.B., Jamour, F., Zhao, Z., & Hristidis, V. (2020). *App-Aware Response Synthesis for User Reviews*. Available at: https://github.com/AARSynth/Dataset

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information clearly, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper attribution and reference in any future work that utilizes this dataset.
