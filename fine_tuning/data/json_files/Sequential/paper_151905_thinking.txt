To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Multi-Biometrics for Twins Identification Based Speech and Ear" by Cihan AKIN et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract indicates that the study uses a database of photos and speech data from 39 twins, which suggests that this is a primary dataset for the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **subsequent sections** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets. In the introduction, the authors mention the need for multimodal recognition systems and reference several databases relevant to their work. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned.

In the **main body of the paper**, particularly in sections discussing the methodology and experiments, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets. The authors describe several databases, including:

1. **Audio-Visual Twins Database**: This dataset contains 39 pairs of twins, including face images, videos, and voice records. It is specifically used in this study for speech and ear recognition tasks.

2. **BANCA Database**: A European secure system project that includes face and voice recognition data from 208 individuals (104 men and 104 women).

3. **MyIdea Database**: A multimodal biometric database designed for identity verification, which includes various biometric parameters from 104 individuals.

4. **BioSec Database**: This dataset includes fingerprints, face images, iris images, and voice data from 200 subjects.

5. **Twins' Multimodal Biometric Database**: Created by Hamid Behravan and Karim Faez, this database includes 6 biometric traits from 104 subjects, with 52 pairs of twins.

6. **CASIA Database**: Contains face, iris, and fingerprint images from 92 pairs of twins.

I will also check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The full citations I will extract include:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
