To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aff-Wild Database and AffWildNet" by Mengyao Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the Aff-Wild database as the largest database of spontaneous facial expressions annotated with valence and arousal values. This indicates that the Aff-Wild dataset is a primary focus of the research.

2. **Identify Key Sections**: Next, I will look for sections that specifically discuss datasets. In this case, I will focus on sections like "Database" and "Experiments" where datasets are likely to be described in detail.

3. **Locate Dataset Descriptions**: In the "Database" section, I will find detailed descriptions of the Aff-Wild database. The paper states that the Aff-Wild database consists of videos collected from YouTube, annotated with valence and arousal values, and provides specific statistics about the dataset, such as the number of frames and the distribution of annotations.

4. **Extract Dataset Information**: I will extract the following key details about the Aff-Wild dataset:
   - **Name**: Aff-Wild Database
   - **Description**: The largest database of spontaneous facial expressions in the wild, annotated with valence and arousal values.
   - **Number of Videos**: 159 videos
   - **Total Frames**: 756,424 frames
   - **Annotations**: Continuous valence and arousal values ranging from -1000 to 1000, scaled to [-1.0, 1.0].
   - **Diversity**: The dataset includes a balanced distribution of male and female subjects.

5. **Check References for Citations**: I will then check the references section of the paper to find the full citation for the Aff-Wild database. The citation is likely to include the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

6. **Compile the Dataset Entry**: Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included. The citation for the Aff-Wild database is:
   > Zafeiriou, S., Kollias, D., Nicolaou, M. A., Papaioannou, A., Zhao, G., & Kotsia, I. (2017). Aff-Wild: Valence and arousal 'in-the-wild' challenge. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (pp. 34-41).

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the dataset from the research paper.
