To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparative Study of Bitcoin Price Prediction" by Ali Mohammadjafari, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of neural network models to forecast Bitcoin prices, and the introduction indicates that the study employs the **Bitcoin Historical Data dataset from Yahoo Finance**. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized, and I need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** section. In this paper, the dataset is described in the **Goal and Contributions** section, where it states that the Bitcoin Historical Data dataset comprises daily Bitcoin prices from 2015 to the present, along with other features like volume and market capitalization.

Now, I will ensure to note down the specifics of the dataset:
- **Bitcoin Historical Data dataset**: This dataset includes daily prices of Bitcoin, along with additional features such as volume and market capitalization. The data is sourced from Yahoo Finance and spans from December 31, 2015, to April 6, 2023.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is sourced from Yahoo Finance, it may not have a formal citation like a traditional academic paper. Instead, I will document it as follows:

- **Bitcoin Historical Data dataset**: 
  > Yahoo Finance. *Bitcoin Historical Data*. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD (Accessed: April 6, 2023).

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation. This will allow me to present the extracted dataset in a clear and organized manner for further processing or review.
