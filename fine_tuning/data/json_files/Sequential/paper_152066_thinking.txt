To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Convolutional Encoder Model for Neural Machine Translation" by Jonas Gehring et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluations on WMT’16 English-Romanian, WMT’15 English-German, and WMT’14 English-French, indicating that these are likely datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe the datasets as follows:

1. **IWSLT 2014 German-English Dataset**: This dataset is used for the German-English machine translation track, consisting of 167K sentence pairs for training and 6948 sentence pairs for testing.

2. **WMT 2016 English-Romanian Dataset**: The authors mention using 2.8M sentence pairs for training and evaluating on newstest2016.

3. **WMT 2015 English-German Dataset**: This dataset includes 3.9M sentence pairs for training, using various sources like Europarl v7 and Common Crawl, and results are reported on newstest2015.

4. **WMT 2014 English-French Dataset**: The authors use a commonly used subset of 12M sentence pairs for training, with results reported on ntst14.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **IWSLT 2014**, the citation is:
  > Mauro Cettolo, Jan Niehues, Sebastian Stüker, Luisa Bentivogli, and Marcello Federico. *Report on the 11th IWSLT evaluation campaign*. In Proceedings of IWSLT, 2014.

- For **WMT 2016**, the citation is:

  > Holger Schwenk. *http://www-lium.univ-lemans.fr/˜schwenk/cslm_joint_paper/*. Accessed: 2016-10-15.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
