To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Compliance Checking with NLI: Privacy Policies vs. Regulations" by Amin Rabinia and Zane Nygaard, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize Natural Language Inference (NLI) techniques to compare privacy regulations against sections of privacy policies from large companies, suggesting that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss their approach and mention two specific datasets used for training their models: the **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI)** dataset and the **Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI)** dataset. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the subsequent sections.

In **section 3 (Design)**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of both datasets:

1. **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI)**: This dataset consists of 570,000 human-written English sentence pairs that are manually labeled for entailment, contradiction, and neutral relationships. It is noted for its rich vocabulary and is widely used in NLI tasks.

2. **Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI)**: This dataset contains 433,000 sentence pairs annotated with textual entailment information. It is designed to be more diverse than SNLI, including sentence pairs from various genres, which helps models generalize better.

In **section 4 (Evaluation and Discussion)**, the authors also mention the **PlayDrone** dataset, which contains metadata of over 1 million apps available on the Google Play Store, including links to their privacy policies. This dataset is used to analyze compliance with privacy regulations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1508.05326, 2015.

- For the **Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Nikita Nangia, Adina Williams, Angeliki Lazaridou, and Samuel R. Bowman. *The ReEval 2017 shared task: Multi-genre natural language inference with sentence representations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.08172, 2017.

- For the **PlayDrone** dataset, the citation is:
  > Nicolas Viennot, Edward Garcia, and Jason Nieh. *A measurement study of Google Play*. In ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review, volume 42, pages 221â€“233. ACM, 2014.

After gathering all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
