To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Aggregating Long-Term Context for Learning Laparoscopic and Robot-Assisted Surgical Workflows" by Yutong Ban et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their model on two laparoscopic cholecystectomy datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Cholec80 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 80 cholecystectomy videos, each recorded at 25 frames per second. It includes annotations for tool presence and surgical phases, and the dataset is split into a 40-40 training and testing configuration.

2. **MGH100 Dataset**: This dataset contains 100 cholecystectomy videos, sampled at 30 frames per second. The phases in this dataset are described as more granular and clinically meaningful compared to Cholec80, with specific tasks separated into distinct phases. The dataset is divided into 80 training videos and 20 testing videos.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Cholec80 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Twinanda, A. P., Shehata, S., Mutter, D., Marescaux, J., De Mathelin, M., & Padoy, N. (2016). EndoNet: A deep architecture for recognition tasks on laparoscopic videos. *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 36(1), 86-97.

- For the **MGH100 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hashimoto, D. A., Axelsson, C. G., Jones, C. B., Phitayakorn, R., Petrusa, E., McKinley, S. K., Gee, D., & Pugh, C. (2019). Surgical procedural map scoring for decision-making in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. *The American Journal of Surgery*, 217(2), 356-361.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
