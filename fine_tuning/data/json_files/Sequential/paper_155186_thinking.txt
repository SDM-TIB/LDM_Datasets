To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prediction of Fund Net Value Based on ARIMA-LSTM Hybrid Model" by Peng Zhou and Fangyi Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses the context of fund net value prediction but does not provide specific dataset names either.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Example Analysis)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Data Processing)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they selected the **1260-day fund net value data of Huabao Hybrid Fund (240008)** from June 6, 2016, to July 30, 2021. This is a clear indication of the dataset being utilized in their study.

The paper states that the data is derived from the historical net value of funds published on the **Tiantian Fund Website**. This is important information as it indicates the source of the dataset.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset. Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, I will note the details as follows:

- **Huabao Hybrid Fund (240008)**: This dataset consists of 1260 days of fund net value data, which is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset or its source. However, the references primarily focus on other studies and do not provide a specific citation for the Tiantian Fund Website or the Huabao Hybrid Fund.

Since the dataset is derived from a specific fund's historical data, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Huabao Hybrid Fund (240008)**: Contains 1260 days of fund net value data from June 6, 2016, to July 30, 2021, sourced from the Tiantian Fund Website.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ensure that I include the relevant details for the dataset.

In conclusion, I have identified the dataset used in the research paper and noted its details, including the time frame and source. I will now prepare to present this information in the required format.
