To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mapping Text to Knowledge Graph Entities" by Dimitri Kartsaklis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is evaluated on "large-scale text-to-entity mapping and entity classification tasks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their evaluations. In **subsection 4.1 (Text-to-entity mapping)**, they describe a dataset constructed from **SNOMED CT**, which consists of 21,000 medical concepts, each associated with multi-word textual descriptions. This dataset is crucial for their text-to-entity mapping task.

In **subsection 4.2 (Reverse dictionary)**, the authors mention using a dataset of 500 term-definition pairs from **WordNet** for their reverse dictionary task. This dataset is also significant for their experiments.

In **subsection 4.3 (Document classification)**, they refer to the **Cora dataset**, which contains 2,708 machine learning papers linked by citation relationships. This dataset is used for document classification tasks.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **SNOMED CT dataset**, the citation is:
   > SNOMED International. *SNOMED CT*. Available at: https://www.snomed.org/snomed-ct.

2. For the **WordNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > George Miller. *WordNet: An Electronic Lexical Database*. Communications of the ACM, 38(11):39–41, 1998.

3. For the **Cora dataset**, the citation is:
   > Andrew Kachites McCallum, Kamal Nigam, Jason Rennie, and Kristie Seymore. *Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning*. Information Retrieval, 3(2):127–163, 2000.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
