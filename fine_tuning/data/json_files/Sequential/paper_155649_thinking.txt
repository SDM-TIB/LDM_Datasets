To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-driven and machine-learning based prediction of wave propagation behavior in dam-break flood" by Changli Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors use a machine learning model trained on simulation results consisting of time-sequence flow depths, suggesting that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context about the datasets. The introduction discusses the computational prediction of wave propagation in dam-break floods and mentions the use of numerical solutions, which implies that the data used for training the model may be derived from simulations.

In the **Materials and Methods** section, particularly in subsection 2.1, the authors describe how they generated the training and test datasets from numerical solutions of the Saint-Venant equations. They mention that they constructed a training set consisting of sequence samples and a test set comprising the next 500 sequence samples. They also state that they randomly selected 28 sets of training/test data, each with a length of 2000 time steps. This is crucial information for identifying the datasets.

The authors refer to these datasets as **TP1, TP2, ..., TP28**, indicating that they are testing different time periods for training the machine learning model. I will note that these datasets are derived from the simulation results and are not publicly available as standalone datasets but are instead part of the simulation data uploaded to a GitHub repository.

Now, I will check the **Data Availability** section to find the specific reference to the dataset. The authors mention that the simulation results have been uploaded to a GitHub repository, which is crucial for citation purposes. The repository is titled "lcl1527/dam-break-ESN-LSTM" and can be accessed at the provided URL.

Next, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Training and Test Datasets (TP1 to TP28)**: These datasets are derived from the numerical simulation of a one-dimensional dam-break flood scenario using the Saint-Venant equations. The specific details of each dataset (TP1, TP2, ..., TP28) are not individually cited, but they are part of the overall simulation data available in the GitHub repository.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that the citations are complete and accurate for each dataset derived from the research paper.
