To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time Elastic Neural Networks" by Pierre-François Marteau, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimentation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on "synthetic and real datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimentation section (Section 6)**, where the author discusses results obtained on three specific datasets: 

1. **BME Dataset**: This is a synthetic univariate dataset provided by Laboratoire d’informatique de Grenoble (LIG), at Université Grenoble Alpes. It contains three classes characterized by different patterns in time series data.

2. **ECG200 Dataset**: This dataset consists of univariate time series representing electrocardiogram signals corresponding to normal heart rhythms and myocardial infarction. It is sourced from Olszewski et al. (2001).

3. **ERing Dataset**: This dataset comprises multivariate time series data capturing hand and finger gestures, collected using a finger ring and an electromagnetic sensor. The dataset is referenced from Wilhelm et al. (2015).

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **BME Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is mentioned as being from Laboratoire d’informatique de Grenoble (LIG), Université Grenoble Alpes.

- For the **ECG200 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Olszewski, R., Maxion, R., & Siewiorek, D. (2001). Generalized feature extraction for structural pattern recognition in time-series data. PhD thesis, USA, AAI3040489.

- For the **ERing Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wilhelm, M., Krakowczyk, D., Trollmann, F., & Albayrak, S. (2015). eRing: Multiple finger gesture recognition with one ring using an electric field. In Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Sensor-Based Activity Recognition and Interaction, iWOAR ’15, New York, NY, USA. Association for Computing Machinery. ISBN 9781450334549.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
