To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring the Transformer architecture for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition" by George Sterpu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention significant performance improvements on the **LRS2 dataset**. This indicates that a dataset is explicitly referenced, and I need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In Section 3.3, they mention training both audio and audio-visual Transformer models on the **LRS2 dataset**, providing a detailed description of the dataset's characteristics, such as the number of spoken sentences and the conditions under which they were recorded.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LRS2 dataset. The paper cites it as follows:

- **LRS2 Dataset**: 
  > BBC and O. University, “The Oxford-BBC Lip Reading Sentences 2 (LRS2) Dataset,” http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/∼vgg/data/lip_reading/lrs2.html, 2017, online, Accessed: 2 May 2020.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the LRS2 dataset, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly, including its significance in the context of the research.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will involve summarizing the dataset's key features and its relevance to the study.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that it adheres to the specified requirements for clarity and completeness.
