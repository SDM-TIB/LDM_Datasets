To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parallel WaveNet Conditioned on VAE Latent Vectors" by J. Rohnke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a neural vocoder and conditioning vectors, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors describe the data used for training their models. In this section, they mention training on a diverse set of **63 hours of data from a single female US speaker**, which includes both neutral and expressive styles. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find its formal name and citation.

In section 3.1, the authors provide details about the dataset, specifically mentioning that it contains **46 hours of audio in a traditional neutral style and an additional 17 hours of expressive data**. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset. I will need to check the references to see if they cite any specific datasets or sources related to this data.

Upon reviewing the **References section**, I find that the authors refer to a few relevant works, but they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset they used. The closest reference is to a paper that discusses a similar acoustic model architecture, but it does not directly cite the dataset itself.

Since the dataset does not have a formal citation in the paper, I will note that the authors used a proprietary dataset from Amazon, which is not publicly available. Therefore, I will document this as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Amazon TTS Dataset
   - **Description**: A proprietary dataset containing 63 hours of audio from a single female US speaker, including 46 hours of neutral style and 17 hours of expressive data.
   - **Citation**: Not publicly available; proprietary dataset from Amazon.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have captured all necessary details about the dataset used in the research paper.
