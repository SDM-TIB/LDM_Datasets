To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Sequential Phrase Grounding (SeqGROUND)" by Pelin Dogan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors show competitive performance on the **Flickr30K benchmark dataset**, indicating that this dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section (Section 4.2)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention the **Flickr30K Entities dataset**, which contains 31,783 images, each annotated with five sentences. This section also describes the dataset's structure, including the presence of noun phrases and their corresponding bounding boxes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Flickr30K Entities dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> B. A. Plummer, L. Wang, C. M. Cervantes, J. C. Caicedo, J. Hockenmaier, and S. Lazebnik. *Flickr30k entities: Collecting region-to-phrase correspondences for richer image-to-sentence models*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2641â€“2649, 2015.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **Flickr30K Entities dataset**, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly, including its purpose and structure as described in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included, and prepare it for structured output as required.
