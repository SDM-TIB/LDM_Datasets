To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LOCAL PATCH AUTOAUGMENT WITH MULTI-AGENT COLLABORATION" by Shiqi Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets for image classification and fine-grained image recognition, specifically naming **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, **ImageNet**, **CUB-200-2011**, **Stanford Cars**, and **FGVC-Aircraft**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of these datasets. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **ImageNet**. They also mention the three fine-grained object recognition datasets: **CUB-200-2011**, **Stanford Cars**, and **FGVC-Aircraft**. Each dataset is likely to have specific characteristics that the authors may describe.

I will then check the **appendix** (Appendix B) for more detailed descriptions of these datasets. The appendix provides information about the number of training examples, image sizes, and the number of categories for each dataset:

1. **CIFAR-10**: Contains 50,000 training examples, each image is of size 32 × 32, and there are 10 categories.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, it also has 50,000 training examples, with images of size 32 × 32, but it has 100 categories.
3. **ImageNet**: Comprises about 1.2 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 classes, with images resized to 224 × 224.
4. **CUB-200-2011**: Contains 6,000 training images distributed across 200 categories, with images sized at 448 × 448.
5. **Stanford Cars**: Includes 16,185 images in 196 classes, with images sized at 448 × 448.
6. **FGVC-Aircraft**: Comprises 10,200 images of aircraft, with 100 images for each of 102 different aircraft model variants, also sized at 448 × 448.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the references section of the paper:

- **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- **ImageNet**:

- **CUB-200-2011**:
  > Catherine Wah, Steve Branson, Peter Welinder, Pietro Perona, and Serge Belongie. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset*. 2011.

- **Stanford Cars**:
  > Jonathan Krause, Michael Stark, Jia Deng, and Li Fei-Fei. *3D object representations for fine-grained categorization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on computer vision workshops, pp. 554–561, 2013.

- **FGVC-Aircraft**:
  > Subhransu Maji, Esa Rahtu, Juho Kannala, Matthew Blaschko, and Andrea Vedaldi. *Fine-grained visual classification of aircraft*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1306.5151, 2013.

After compiling this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references or analyses.
