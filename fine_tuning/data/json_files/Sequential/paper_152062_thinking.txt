To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Dynamic Graph LSTM for Action-driven Video Object Detection" by Yuan Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to evaluations on a "large-scale daily-life action dataset (i.e., Charades)" and mention releasing object bounding-box annotations for over 5,000 frames in Charades. This indicates that Charades is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Dataset and Evaluation Measures)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the Charades dataset. They mention that it consists of daily indoor activities collected through Amazon Mechanical Turk, with 157 action classes and an average of 6.8 actions per video. The training set contains 7,542 videos, and they also discuss the bounding box annotations collected for 5,000 test frames from 200 videos in the Charades test set.

In this section, I will confirm that Charades is indeed the only dataset explicitly mentioned for their experiments. The authors emphasize the challenges posed by the dataset, such as cluttered backgrounds and low resolution, which further highlights its significance in the context of their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the Charades dataset. The relevant citation is:

> G. A. Sigurdsson, G. Varol, X. Wang, A. Farhadi, I. Laptev, and A. Gupta. *Hollywood in homes: Crowdsourcing data collection for activity understanding*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2016.

Having gathered all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry for Charades, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will complete the extraction process for the datasets mentioned in the paper.
