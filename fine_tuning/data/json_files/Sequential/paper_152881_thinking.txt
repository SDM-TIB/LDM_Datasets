To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation of Contextualized Embeddings for Sequence Labeling" by Xiaochuang Han and Jacob Eisenstein, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of their method on two challenging domains: Early Modern English and Twitter, which suggests that datasets related to these domains may be present.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 2 (Tagging Historical Texts)** and **section 4 (Evaluation Setting)**. In section 2.1, the authors mention the **Penn-Helsinki Corpus of Early Modern English (PPCEME)**, which is a dataset used for part-of-speech tagging of historical texts. This is a clear indication that I should include this dataset.

In section 4, the authors describe their evaluation settings and mention the **CONLL 2003 shared task dataset** for named entity recognition, which is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. For the **Penn-Helsinki Corpus of Early Modern English (PPCEME)**, the citation is:
   > Kroch, A., Santorini, B., & Diertani, A. (2004). *Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Early Modern English*. Retrieved from http://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/PPCEME-RELEASE-2/index.html.

2. For the **CONLL 2003 shared task dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tjong Kim Sang, E. F., & De Meulder, F. (2003). Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition. In *Proceedings of the Conference on Natural Language Learning (CoNLL)*, pages 142â€“147.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into the required format for further processing or review. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
