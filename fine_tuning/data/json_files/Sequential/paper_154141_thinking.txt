To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Arabic Text Recognition" by Mohammad Fasha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the datasets section** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model was tested on a custom dataset with over two million word samples generated using 18 different Arabic font types, which suggests that there is a significant dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (The Compiled Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets they compiled. Here, I will look for specific names, characteristics, and sizes of the datasets mentioned.

In this section, the authors describe five datasets, which I will summarize:

1. **Dataset 1**: A single-font dataset using the ae-Nice font, containing 60,000 samples. It has duplicates in samples and a size of 148 MB.

2. **Dataset 2**: Another single-font dataset using the ae-Nice font, but with 120,000 samples. It also contains duplicates and has a size of 295 MB.

3. **Dataset 3**: A two-font dataset using ae-Nice and K-Karman fonts, containing 240,000 samples with duplicates, and a size of 490 MB.

4. **Dataset 4**: A larger dataset using 18 different fonts, containing 2,160,000 samples with duplicates, and a size of 6200 MB.

5. **Dataset 5**: A unique dataset using 18 different fonts, containing 450,000 unique samples, and a size of 1300 MB.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors reference various datasets and tools, but they primarily focus on their custom datasets. Since the custom datasets are not standard datasets with established citations, I will note that the authors have made these datasets publicly available along with a toolkit for generating similar datasets.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with the necessary details, including the names, characteristics, and sizes of each dataset, while ensuring to include the citation for the paper itself:

- For the custom datasets, I will cite the paper as follows:
  > Fasha, M., Hammo, B., Obeid, N., & AlWidian, J. (2020). A Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Arabic Text Recognition. *International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications*, 11(8), 122-130. doi:10.14569/IJACSA.2020.0110816

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
