To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network with Attention Fusion for Traffic Flow Prediction" by Xunlian Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **four real-world traffic datasets**, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They list the datasets as **PeMSD3, PeMSD4, PeMSD7, and PeMSD8**, collected by the California Department of Transportation sensors on highways. This section provides a brief description of each dataset, including the number of sensors, edges, samples, and the time range of the data collected.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the datasets is as follows:

- For **PeMSD3**, the citation is:
  > Chao Chen, Karl Petty, Alexander Skabardonis, Pravin Varaiya, and Zhanfeng Jia. "Freeway performance measurement system: mining loop detector data." *Transportation Research Record*, 96–102, (2001).

- For **PeMSD4**, the citation is the same as PeMSD3 since they are part of the same dataset collection.

- For **PeMSD7**, the citation is:
  > Chao Chen, Karl Petty, Alexander Skabardonis, Pravin Varaiya, and Zhanfeng Jia. "Freeway performance measurement system: mining loop detector data." *Transportation Research Record*, 96–102, (2001).

- For **PeMSD8**, the citation is also the same as PeMSD3.

Since PeMSD3, PeMSD4, PeMSD7, and PeMSD8 are all derived from the same source, I will note that the citation applies to all of them.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
