To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Human Activity Recognition Using Deep Learning Approaches: Single Frame CNN and Convolutional LSTM" by Sheryl Mathew et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a benchmark action recognition dataset, **UCF50**, and another dataset created by the authors themselves. This is a good starting point for identifying the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset section (III)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **UCF50 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 50 action categories with realistic videos sourced from YouTube. The authors note that it is challenging due to variations in camera motion, object appearance, and other factors. They mention that the average number of videos per action category is 133.

2. **Custom Dataset**: The authors created their own dataset that includes three basic activities: walking, sitting, and jumping. They describe that this dataset primarily features Indian faces and consists of 21 videos per action category, with each video lasting between 3 to 15 seconds.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The UCF50 dataset is commonly referenced in the literature, so I will look for its authoritative citation. The custom dataset, being created by the authors, may not have a formal citation but I will note its details as described in the paper.

For the **UCF50 Dataset**, the citation is:
> Juan Carlos Niebles, Hongchang Wang, and Li Fei-Fei. *Unsupervised Learning of Human Action Categories Using Spatial-Temporal Words*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 79(3):299â€“318, 2008.

For the **Custom Dataset**, since it is created by the authors, I will note it as:
> Sheryl Mathew, Annapoorani Subramanian, S. Pooja, Balamurugan MS. *Human Activity Recognition Using Deep Learning Approaches: Single Frame CNN and Convolutional LSTM*. School of Electronics Engineering, Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai, India.

Now that I have identified and described the datasets along with their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
