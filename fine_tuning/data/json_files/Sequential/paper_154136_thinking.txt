To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantum Long Short-Term Memory" by Samuel Yen-Chi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed QLSTM model and its applications, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section V) closely, as this is where datasets are typically described in detail. I will look for any specific datasets that the authors used for training and testing their QLSTM model. The experiments section outlines various scenarios, including learning from periodic functions, damped harmonic oscillators, and Bessel functions, but I need to confirm if any datasets are explicitly named.

As I read through the experiments, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant details about how they were generated or sourced. If the authors refer to datasets used in their experiments, I will ensure to document their names and descriptions accurately.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. This is crucial, as I need to provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset. I will look for any papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail, ensuring that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

If the datasets are not directly cited in the references, I will note any relevant information provided in the text that could help in locating the datasets later.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all information is clear and accessible for future use or analysis.
