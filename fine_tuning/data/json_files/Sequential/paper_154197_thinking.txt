To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Compress Videos without Computing Motion" by Meixu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors trained their model on the **Kinetics-600 dataset** and the **Vimeo-90K dataset**, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding their experimental setup.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they trained the MOVI-Codec architecture on the **Kinetics-600 dataset** and the **Vimeo-90K dataset**. They also mention testing on the **UVG dataset**, the **VTL dataset**, and the **HEVC Standard Test Sequences**. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Kinetics-600 dataset**: The citation is:
   > Kay, W., Carreira, J., Simonyan, K., Zhang, B., Hillier, C., Vijayanarasimhan, S., Viola, F., Green, T., Back, T., & Natsev, P. (2017). *The Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950.

2. **Vimeo-90K dataset**: The citation is:
   > Xue, T., Chen, B., Wu, J., Wei, D., & Freeman, W. T. (2019). *Video Enhancement with Task-Oriented Flow*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 127(8), 1106-1125.

3. **UVG dataset**: The citation is:
   > Ultra Video Group. (2020). *UVG Test Sequences*. Retrieved from http://ultravideo.cs.tut.fi/#testsequences.

4. **VTL dataset**: The citation is:
   > V. T. Library. (2020). *VTL Test Sequences*. Retrieved from http://trace.eas.asu.edu/index.html.

5. **HEVC Standard Test Sequences**: The citation is:
   > Bossen, F., et al. (2013). *Common Test Conditions and Software Reference Configurations*. JCTVC-L1100, 12, 7.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
