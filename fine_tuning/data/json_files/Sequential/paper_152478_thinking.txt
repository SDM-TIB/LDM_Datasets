To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mother Compact Recurrent Memory" by Abduallah A. Mohamed and Christian Claudel, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments. The introduction often discusses the background and may reference datasets used in prior work, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any text that describes their characteristics or sources.

In the experiments section, the authors mention using the **Penn Treebank (PTB)** dataset for both character-level and word-level language modeling tasks. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized. I will note the details provided about the PTB dataset, including its purpose and how it is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Penn Treebank dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Marcus, M. P.; Marcinkiewicz, M. A.; and Santorini, B. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313â€“330.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, such as those used for specific tasks like the "Adding problem" or "Copy memory test." If the authors reference any datasets for these tasks, I will ensure to extract their names and citations as well.

After gathering all the relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its purpose, and the corresponding citation.

By following this methodical approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all datasets mentioned in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview of the data used in the research.
