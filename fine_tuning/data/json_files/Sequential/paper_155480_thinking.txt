To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classifying Human Activities using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques" by Sanku Satya Uday et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a dataset from Kaggle related to human activity recognition, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.2 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. They refer to the **UCI_HAR_Dataset**, which is provided on the Kaggle platform. The description includes details about the dataset, such as the types of data it contains (tri-axial acceleration and gyroscope data) and the number of data points.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the UCI_HAR_Dataset. The relevant reference is:

- For **UCI_HAR_Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Anguita, D., Ghio, A., Oneto, L., Parra Perez, X., & Reyes Ortiz, J. L. (2013). A public domain dataset for human activity recognition using smartphones. In Proceedings of the 21th international European symposium on artificial neural networks, computational intelligence and machine learning (pp. 437-442).

Since the dataset is hosted on Kaggle, I will also note that it is accessible through the following link:
> Learning, U. C. I. M. (2019, November 13). Human activity recognition with smartphones. Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After completing this process, I will have a structured dataset entry ready for further use or processing.
