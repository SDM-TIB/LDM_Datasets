To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NetSentry: A Deep Learning Approach to Detecting Incipient Large-scale Network Attacks" by Haoyu Liu and Paul Patras, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors cross-evaluate their method using two practical datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection labeled **"Datasets"**. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CIC-IDS-2017**: This dataset contains various common cyber attacks, including bruteforcing, heartbleed, botnet, and DDoS attacks. It was collected in a LAN environment, with benign traffic generated by profiling normal online behaviors of users across different operating systems. The authors note that the dataset consists of 51.1 GB of pcap files.

2. **CSE-CIC-IDS2018**: This dataset was generated in a larger organizational LAN environment with multiple subnets and includes a wider range of benign traffic and a larger collection of attack types (17 types). The dataset spans 10 days and includes traffic from 450 machines acting as normal users and 50 as attackers.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **CIC-IDS-2017**:
  > Sharafaldin, I., Alazab, M., & Hossain, M. S. (2018). *Toward generating a new intrusion detection dataset and intrusion traffic characterization*. In ICISSP.

- For **CSE-CIC-IDS2018**:
  > Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity. (2018). *A Realistic Cyber Defense Dataset (CSE-CIC-IDS2018)*. Retrieved from https://registry.opendata.aws/cse-cic-ids2018/.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all necessary information for future reference or processing.
