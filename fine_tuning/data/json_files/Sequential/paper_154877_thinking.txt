To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying Hijacked Reviews" by Monika Daryani and James Caverlee, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that there are no public datasets of review hijacking, which indicates that the authors may have created synthetic datasets for their study. This is a crucial point to note as it suggests that the datasets may not be traditional datasets but rather generated data.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used or created. The **methodology** section, particularly **section 3 (Generating Synthetic Examples of Review Hijacking)**, is likely to contain information about the datasets. Here, the authors describe their approach to generating synthetic data by swapping reviews between products. They mention using the **Amazon dataset** provided by McAuley, which contains 233.1 million reviews from May 1996 to October 2018. This dataset is significant as it serves as the foundation for their synthetic data generation.

In this section, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **Amazon Dataset**: This dataset is crucial as it provides the base reviews from which the authors generate synthetic examples of review hijacking. It includes product information and reviews, which are essential for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Amazon dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Jianmo Ni, Jiacheng Li, and Julian McAuley. *Justifying recommendations using distantly-labeled reviews and fine-grained aspects*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 188â€“197, 2019.

Additionally, I will note that the authors created synthetic datasets through their methodology, but these do not have formal citations since they are generated data. However, I will still document the process they used to create these datasets for clarity.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and can be easily referenced later.
