To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AMER: Automatic Behavior Modeling and Interaction Exploration in Recommender Systems" by Pengyu Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate AMER using three types of datasets: sequential datasets, non-sequential datasets, and a hybrid dataset. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they categorize the datasets into three types:

1. **Sequential Datasets**: The authors mention two specific datasets:
   - **Amazon Beauty Dataset**: This dataset consists of reviews and metadata from Amazon.com, specifically in the "Beauty" category.
   - **Steam Dataset**: This dataset contains millions of reviews from the Steam video game platform.

2. **Non-sequential Datasets**: The paper discusses two datasets used for click-through rate (CTR) prediction:
   - **Criteo Dataset**: This dataset includes click-through data with 26 anonymous categorical fields and 13 continuous fields.
   - **Avazu Dataset**: This dataset consists of online ad click-through data with 24 categorical fields.

3. **Hybrid Dataset**: The authors refer to the **Alimama CTR Dataset**, which contains both sequential and non-sequential data for comprehensive evaluation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further research.

The citations I will extract are:
- For the **Amazon Beauty Dataset**:
  > Julian McAuley, Christopher Targett, Qinfeng Shi, and Anton Van Den Hengel. *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pages 43–52, 2015.

- For the **Steam Dataset**:
  > Balázs Hidasi, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Linas Baltrunas, and Paolo Cremonesi. *Personalizing session-based recommendations with hierarchical recurrent neural networks*. In Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pages 130–137, 2017.

- For the **Criteo Dataset**:
  > Criteo. *Criteo Labs: Download Terabyte Click Logs*. Available at: http://labs.criteo.com/downloads/download-terabyte-click-logs/.

- For the **Avazu Dataset**:
  > Avazu. *Avazu CTR Prediction Dataset*. Available at: http://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction.

- For the **Alimama CTR Dataset**:
  > Alimama. *Alimama CTR Dataset*. Available at: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=56.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in organizing the information effectively for further use or analysis.
