To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reacting like Humans: Incorporating Intrinsic Human Behaviors into NAO through Sound-Based Reactions for Enhanced Sociability" by Ali Ghadami et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it may not mention specific datasets, it sets the context for the research. The introduction often discusses the background and motivation, which may lead to identifying datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methods)**, particularly the subsection titled **2.1. Datasets**. This section explicitly describes the datasets used for the experiments. Here, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **Human Motion Dataset**: This dataset was collected using an RGB camera for seven different types of fear actions, with each class containing 40 videos. The subjects performed fear-inspired actions multiple times to ensure diversity in the dataset.

2. **Audio Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1 to 5-second-long recordings organized into 14 classes, with 40 examples per class. The classes include various sounds that can evoke feelings of fear, and the dataset was collected from the ESC-50 and NIGENS datasets.

3. **YOLO Training Dataset**: This dataset was gathered through search engines and includes images of objects that could be fear-causing sources in an indoor environment. Each class contains roughly 400 training samples.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **ESC-50 dataset**, the citation is:
  > K. J. Piczak, "Environmental sound classification with convolutional neural networks," in 2015 IEEE 25th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP), 2015: IEEE, pp. 1-6.

- For the **NIGENS dataset**, the citation is:
  > I. Trowitzsch, J. Taghia, Y. Kashef, and K. Obermayer, "The NIGENS general sound events database," arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.08314, 2019.

- The dataset for human motion generation does not have a specific citation provided in the references, but it is based on the authors' own collection of videos.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
