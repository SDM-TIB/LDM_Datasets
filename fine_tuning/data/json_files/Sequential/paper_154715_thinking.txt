To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the limit of English conversational speech recognition" by Zoltán Tüske et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions improvements on **Switchboard 300 and 2000**, which suggests that these may be datasets used in the research.

Next, I will check the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors discuss their work on end-to-end automatic speech recognition models, and they refer to the **Switchboard** dataset, indicating its significance in their experiments.

In the **experimental setup section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors specifically mention that their research focuses on the **Switchboard (SWB)** English conversational telephony speech recognition benchmark, which confirms that this is a primary dataset for their experiments.

I will also examine the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide further context about the datasets used in their evaluations. The paper repeatedly references the **Switchboard-300** and **Switchboard-2000** datasets, emphasizing their importance in achieving state-of-the-art results.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Switchboard-300** dataset, the citation is:
  > G. Saon et al., “English conversational telephone speech recognition by humans and machines,” in Interspeech, 2017, pp. 132–136.

- For the **Switchboard-2000** dataset, the citation is:
  > G. Saon et al., “Advancing RNN transducer technology for speech recognition,” in ICASSP, 2021.

With these citations in hand, I will now summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Switchboard-300**: A dataset used for English conversational telephony speech recognition, which has been a benchmark for evaluating speech recognition systems.
2. **Switchboard-2000**: Another dataset used for similar purposes, providing a larger corpus for training and evaluation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
