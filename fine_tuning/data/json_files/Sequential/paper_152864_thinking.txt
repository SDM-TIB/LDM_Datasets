To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single Path One-Shot Neural Architecture Search with Uniform Sampling" by Zichao Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large dataset **ImageNet**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets used for training and validation. They explicitly state that all experiments are performed on **ImageNet**, and they detail how the original training set is split into a validation set and a training set.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for ImageNet is as follows:
> Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International journal of computer vision, 115(3), 211â€“252, 2015.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the ImageNet dataset, I will document this dataset in detail.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
