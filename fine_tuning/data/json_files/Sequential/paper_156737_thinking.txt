To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Short-term Inland Vessel Trajectory Prediction with Encoder-Decoder Models" by Kathrin Donandt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of AIS data for vessel trajectory prediction, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

Next, I will examine **section V (Experiments and Results)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention that the dataset used was provided by the German Federal Waterway Engineering and Research Institute (BAW) and consists of 29 months of AIS data from a specific section of the Danube river.

In this section, the authors provide specific details about the dataset:
- The dataset includes **7.7k trajectories** extracted from AIS data, covering a **hectometer range from 2231.4 to 2321.44** on the Danube river.
- The data spans from **May 2019 to September 2021**.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the dataset itself is not attributed to a specific publication but rather to the German Federal Waterway Engineering and Research Institute. Therefore, I will cite it as follows:

- **AIS Dataset from BAW**: 
  > German Federal Waterway Engineering and Research Institute (BAW). *AIS Data of the Danube River (May 2019 - September 2021)*. Unpublished dataset.

Since the dataset is not formally published, I will note it as an unpublished dataset in the citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper attribution and facilitate further research or validation of the findings presented in the paper.
