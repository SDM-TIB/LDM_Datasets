To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering with Dynamic Time Warping for Household Load Curve Clustering" by Fadi AlMahamid and Katarina Grolinger, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction may mention the context or previous datasets used in similar studies.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Methodology)**, where the authors describe the dataset preparation. Here, they mention that the dataset contains hourly energy consumption data for **19 households** captured between **2014 and 2016**, provided by **London Hydro**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

In this section, the authors explain how the data was reformatted into **Daily Load Curves (DLCs)**, which represent the energy consumption for each household over a day. This detail is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

I will also check the **acknowledgment section** for any funding or support that might relate to the dataset, but it is unlikely to provide additional dataset information.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is proprietary and provided by London Hydro, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the source as follows:

- **Household Energy Consumption Dataset**: 
  > London Hydro. *Hourly energy consumption data for 19 households (2014-2016)*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry based on the information gathered, ensuring to include the citation for the dataset as accurately as possible.

After completing this process, I will have a structured entry ready for review or further processing.
