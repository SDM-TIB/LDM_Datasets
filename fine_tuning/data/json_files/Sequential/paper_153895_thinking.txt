To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quaternion Neural Networks for Multi-channel Distant Speech Recognition" by Xinchi Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of distant automatic speech recognition (ASR) and hints at the use of multi-channel audio recordings, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experimental protocol sections**. In section 3 (Experimental Protocol), the authors explicitly mention two datasets used in their experiments:

1. **TIMIT Dataset**: The paper describes the TIMIT corpus as containing broadband recordings of 630 speakers, with specific details about the training, testing, and validation splits. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed model.

2. **DIRHA Dataset**: The authors also mention the DIRHA-English corpus, which is used to validate their model in more realistic conditions. They provide context about the dataset's characteristics and how it relates to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **TIMIT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. S. Garofolo, L. F. Lamel, W. M. Fisher, J. G. Fiscus, and D. S. Pallett. *DARPA TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus CD-ROM. NIST Speech Disc 1-1.1*. NASA STI/Recon Technical Report N, vol. 93, 1993.

- For the **DIRHA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > L. Cristoforetti, M. Ravanelli, M. Omologo, A. Sosi, A. Abad, M. Hagmüller, and P. Maragos. *The DIRHA Simulated Corpus*. In Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC), 2014, pp. 2629–2634.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
