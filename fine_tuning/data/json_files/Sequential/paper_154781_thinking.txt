To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Three Sentences Are All You Need: Local Path Enhanced Document Relation Extraction" by Quzhe Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors perform an analysis over three document-level relation extraction benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be named later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention the three widely-used document RE datasets: **DocRED**, **CDR**, and **GDA**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their research.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of these datasets in the **experiments section** to gather more details about each dataset. In the introduction, the authors reference DocRED (Yao et al., 2019), CDR (Li et al., 2016), and GDA (Wu et al., 2019) as the datasets used for their analysis. 

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **DocRED**, the citation is:
   > Yuan Yao, Deming Ye, Peng Li, Xu Han, Yankai Lin, Zhenghao Liu, Zhiyuan Liu, Lixin Huang, Jie Zhou, and Maosong Sun. *DocRED: A large-scale document-level relation extraction dataset*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 764–777, Florence, Italy, 2019.

2. For **CDR**, the citation is:
   > Jiao Li, Yueping Sun, Robin J Johnson, Daniela Sciaky, Chih-Hsuan Wei, Robert Leaman, Allan Peter Davis, Carolyn J Mattingly, Thomas C Wiegers, and Zhiyong Lu. *Biocreative V CDR task corpus: A resource for chemical disease relation extraction*. Database: the journal of biological databases and curation, 2016:baw068.

3. For **GDA**, the citation is:
   > Ye Wu, Ruibang Luo, Henry CM Leung, Hing-Fung Ting, and Tak-Wah Lam. *Renet: A deep learning approach for extracting gene-disease associations from literature*. In International Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology, pages 272–284. Springer, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
