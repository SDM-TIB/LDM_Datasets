To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empirical Study on Deep Learning Models for QA" by Yang Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a "simulated QA data set," which suggests that there is at least one dataset to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors describe the AI-Complete data. They provide details about this dataset, including its purpose and structure. The AI-Complete dataset is described as a synthetic dataset designed for a set of AI tasks, with specific training and test set sizes.

In section 3, the authors state that the AI-Complete data consists of small and large training sets with 1,000 and 10,000 questions, respectively, and a test set with 1,000 questions. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's characteristics and its intended use for evaluating question answering models.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AI-Complete dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **AI-Complete dataset**, the citation is:
  > Weston, J., Bordes, A., Chopra, S., & Mikolov, T. (2015). *Towards AI-complete question answering: A set of prerequisite toy tasks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1502.05698.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper referencing. This will allow for accurate documentation and future retrieval of the dataset information.
