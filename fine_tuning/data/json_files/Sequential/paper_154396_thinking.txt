To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UNetGAN: A Robust Speech Enhancement Approach in Time Domain for Extremely Low Signal-to-noise Ratio Condition" by Xiang Hao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a public benchmark, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Dataset and metrics)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they used the **TIMIT corpus** as the clean database and the **NOISEX-92 corpus** for noise interference. This section provides crucial details about how the datasets were utilized in their experiments.

1. **TIMIT Corpus**: The authors describe it as the clean database used for their experiments. They mention that they randomly selected 750 utterances from TIMIT, dividing them into training, validation, and test parts.

2. **NOISEX-92 Corpus**: This corpus is used to introduce noise into the clean speech samples. The authors specify that they selected various noise types from this corpus to mix with the clean speech at different SNR levels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **TIMIT corpus**, the citation is:
  > J. S. Garofolo, L. F. Lamel, W. M. Fisher, J. G. Fiscus, and D. S. Pallett. *DARPA TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus CD-ROM*. NASA STI/Recon Technical Report N, vol. 93, 1993.

- For the **NOISEX-92 corpus**, the citation is:
  > A. Varga and H. J. Steeneken. “Assessment for Automatic Speech Recognition: II. NOISEX-92: A Database and an Experiment to Study the Effect of Additive Noise on Speech Recognition Systems.” *Speech Communication*, vol. 12, no. 3, pp. 247–251, 1993.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
