To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gates are not what you need in RNNs" by Ronalds Zakovskis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. I will carefully note each dataset mentioned, along with any relevant details provided about them.

The datasets identified in this section are:

1. **JSB Chorales**: This dataset is used for polyphonic music modeling. It contains sequences of piano-roll elements and is already split into training, validation, and testing portions.

2. **Nottingham**: Another dataset for polyphonic music modeling, similar to JSB Chorales, also pre-split into training, validation, and testing.

3. **MuseData**: This dataset is used for the same polyphonic music modeling task and is similarly structured.

4. **Piano-midi.de**: This dataset is also for polyphonic music modeling and follows the same format as the others.

5. **Penn Treebank**: This dataset is used for word-level language modeling and is already split into training, validation, and testing portions.

6. **enwik8**: This dataset is used for character-level language modeling and is not pre-split, so the authors mention using a standard split of 90% training, 5% validation, and 5% testing.

7. **text8**: Similar to enwik8, this dataset is also used for character-level language modeling and follows the same splitting convention.

8. **IMDB**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis, consisting of 25,000 training sequences and 25,000 testing sequences.

9. **Sequential MNIST**: This dataset is used for image classification, specifically for predicting the number represented in images of handwritten digits.

10. **Permuted MNIST**: A variant of the MNIST dataset where the pixels of each row are randomly permuted, making the task more challenging.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and should be included in the dataset descriptions.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
