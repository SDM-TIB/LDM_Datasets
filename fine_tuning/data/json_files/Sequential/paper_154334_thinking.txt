To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Adversarial Black-Box Attacks On Text Classifiers Using Multi-Objective Genetic Optimization Guided By Deep Networks" by Alex Mathai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention comparing their approach with DeepWordBug (DWB) on **SST** and **IMDB sentiment datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to their research.

Next, I will look into the **introduction section** where the authors discuss the importance of testing the robustness of deep neural networks in NLP tasks, specifically mentioning the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)** and **IMDB movie reviews** as the datasets used for their experiments. This confirms that both datasets are indeed utilized in their research.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide detailed performance metrics for their algorithm on both datasets, further solidifying their relevance. They also mention the classifiers used, which were trained on these datasets, indicating that they are foundational to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)**, the citation is:
   > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies - Volume 1, HLT ’11, pages 142–150, Stroudsburg, PA, USA. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2011.

2. For the **IMDB movie reviews**, the citation is:
   > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies - Volume 1, HLT ’11, pages 142–150, Stroudsburg, PA, USA. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2011. (Note: The IMDB dataset is often referenced in conjunction with the same authors and paper as it is a common benchmark in sentiment analysis.)

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and proper attribution. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or integration into a larger dataset repository.
