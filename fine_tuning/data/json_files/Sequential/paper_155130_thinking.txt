To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FANS: Fusing ASR and NLU for on-device SLU" by Martin Radfar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on both an in-house SLU dataset and a public SLU dataset, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. They mention two datasets:

1. **FSC Dataset**: This is a public dataset containing 30,000 utterances, which includes 11 intents and 3 slot tags. The authors note that this dataset is used for end-to-end training.

2. **In-house SLU Dataset**: This dataset consists of 500 hours of de-identified data, split into training, evaluation, and test sets. It contains 57 intents and 175 slot tags, with a vocabulary size of approximately 100,000.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The FSC dataset is cited as follows:

- For **FSC Dataset**:

The in-house dataset does not have a specific citation since it is proprietary to the authors, but I will note that it is an internal dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
