To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mosaic Super-resolution via Sequential Feature Pyramid Networks" by Mehrdad Shoeiby et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a super-resolution method for mosaic images, which suggests that datasets related to mosaic images might be involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Dataset generation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **Multi-spectral dataset**: The authors explain that they generate high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) mosaic images from HR multi-spectral cubes in the StereoMSI dataset. They provide dimensions for both HR and LR images and mention the transformation process to create mosaic patterns.

2. **Bayer dataset**: The authors refer to an extended StereoMSI dataset for generating LR mosaic images from HR mosaic images. They provide details about the size of the images and the process of down-sampling to create the LR images.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

- For the **StereoMSI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mehrdad Shoeiby, Antonio Robles-Kelly, Radu Timofte, Ruofan Zhou, Fayez Lahoud, Sabine Susstrunk, Zhiwei Xiong, Zhan Shi, Chang Chen, Dong Liu, Zheng-Jun Zha, Feng Wu, Kaixuan Wei, Tao Zhang, Lizhi Wang, Ying Fu, Zhiwei Zhong, Koushik Nagasubramanian, Asheesh K. Singh, Arti Singh, Soumik Sarkar, and Ganapathysubramanian Baskar. *PIRM2018 challenge on spectral image super-resolution: Methods and results*. In European Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ECCVW), 2018.

- For the **Bayer dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mehrdad Shoeiby, Antonio Robles-Kelly, Radu Timofte. *PIRM2018 challenge on spectral image super-resolution: Dataset and study*. arXiv:1904.00540, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
