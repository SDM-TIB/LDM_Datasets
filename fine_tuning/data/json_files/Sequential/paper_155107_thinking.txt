To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EMF-Aware Cellular Networks in RIS-Assisted Environments" by Hussam Ibraiwish et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract discusses the optimization of RIS phases to minimize EMF exposure, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections**. These sections often contain information about the datasets used for validation or testing. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

As I read through the paper, I will pay attention to any references to existing datasets or any data that the authors may have collected themselves. If the authors mention using data from other studies or publicly available datasets, I will note those down.

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper does not provide full citations for the datasets, I will search for the datasets online to find their original sources and document those citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
