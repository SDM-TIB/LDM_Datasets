To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Alzheimer’s Dementia Recognition Using Acoustic, Lexical, Disfluency and Speech Pause Features Robust to Noisy Inputs" by Morteza Rohanian et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their models on data from the **ADReSSo challenge 2021**, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Data and Features** section, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two distinct datasets:

1. **Dataset 1**: This dataset consists of speech recordings of picture descriptions produced by both Alzheimer’s patients and control subjects. It includes 237 audio recordings, with the subjects' states assessed based on their MMSE scores.

2. **Dataset 2**: This dataset comprises speech recordings from Alzheimer’s patients performing a category fluency task. It is used for predicting cognitive decline over two years.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following relevant works:

- For the **ADReSSo challenge 2021**, the citation is:
  > Luz, S., Haider, F., de la Fuente, S., Fromm, D., & MacWhinney, B. (2021). Detecting cognitive decline using speech only: The ADReSSo challenge. *medRxiv*.

- For the **Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Exam’s Cookie Theft picture**, the citation is:
  > Benton, A. L. (1968). Differential behavioral effects in frontal lobe disease. *Neuropsychologia*, 6(1), 53-60.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
