To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AlexaTM 20B: Few-Shot Learning Using a Large-Scale Multilingual Seq2seq Model" by Saleh Soltan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the AlexaTM 20B model achieves state-of-the-art performance on various tasks, which suggests that it has been evaluated on specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **Training Data Preparation section (Section 3)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for pre-training the model. Here, they mention two primary datasets:

1. **Wikipedia**: The authors state that they used Wikipedia data in multiple languages for training. This dataset is a well-known resource for language modeling and is commonly cited in NLP research.

2. **mC4 Dataset**: The authors refer to the multilingual C4 dataset, which is a large-scale dataset designed for training language models across multiple languages.

In addition to these, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the **Evaluation Setups (Section 5)** and **Evaluation Results (Section 6)**. The authors evaluate their model on several benchmarks, including:

- **Flores-101**: This dataset is used for evaluating machine translation performance across various language pairs.
- **SuperGLUE**: A benchmark for evaluating general language understanding.
- **SQuADv2**: A dataset for question answering tasks.
- **XNLI, XCOPA, Paws-X, and XWinograd**: These datasets are used for evaluating multilingual and commonsense reasoning tasks.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Wikipedia**:

2. **mC4 Dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation, ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis.
