To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Geometry-Aware Gradient Algorithms for Neural Architecture Search" by Liam Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving state-of-the-art results on various NAS benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section**, which is often where datasets are explicitly detailed. In this paper, the authors discuss their evaluations on several benchmarks, including **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **ImageNet-16-120**. I will note these datasets as they are critical for understanding the context of the experiments.

I will also check the **related work** section to see if any additional datasets are referenced or if the authors discuss datasets used in previous studies. This could provide further context or additional datasets that are relevant to their work.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed by others. 

For the datasets identified:
1. **CIFAR-10**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, 2009.

3. **ImageNet-16-120**: The citation is:
   > Olga Russakovsky et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and use in future work. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and attributed in accordance with academic standards.
