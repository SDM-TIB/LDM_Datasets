To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shifted Chunk Transformer for Spatio-Temporal Representational Learning" by Xuefan Zha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on several action recognition benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experiments)**. In this section, the authors mention evaluating their method on five commonly used action recognition datasets: **Kinetics-400**, **Kinetics-600**, **UCF101**, **HMDB51**, and **Moment-in-Time**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will then gather detailed descriptions of each dataset from the text. The paper provides the following information:

1. **Kinetics-400**: A large-scale dataset for action recognition containing 400 action classes, with around 240,000 video clips.
2. **Kinetics-600**: An extension of Kinetics-400, containing 600 action classes and approximately 500,000 video clips.
3. **UCF101**: A dataset consisting of 101 action categories, with 13,320 videos.
4. **HMDB51**: A dataset with 51 action categories, containing 7,000 videos.
5. **Moment-in-Time**: A dataset designed for event understanding, containing 1 million videos.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
