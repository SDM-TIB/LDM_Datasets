To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Question Refinement with Deep Reinforcement Learning in Retrieval-based QA System" by Ye Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "experimental results on real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are used, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Yahoo Dataset**: This dataset is collected from Yahoo's non-factoid question dataset, containing 85,000 questions and their corresponding answers. It includes various types of ill-formed questions generated from well-formed questions.

2. **Customer Service Userlog (CSU)**: This dataset consists of online question-answering user logs from a commercial customer service platform, containing 1 million instances in the Chinese language. After removing duplicates, it has 111,000 triples of ill-formed and well-formed questions.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used both the Yahoo and CSU datasets for their evaluations, which reinforces their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely proprietary or internal datasets. Instead, I will summarize the information provided in the paper.

For the **Yahoo Dataset**, the citation is:
> Yahoo Webscope. "Yahoo non-factoid question dataset." Available at: https://ciir.cs.umass.edu/downloads/nfL6/

For the **Customer Service Userlog (CSU)**, since it is an internal dataset, it may not have a formal citation, but I can note it as:
> Customer Service Userlog (CSU). Anonymized dataset from a commercial customer service platform.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
