To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minimal Gated Unit for Recurrent Neural Networks" by Guo-Bing Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but the experimental results section is likely where datasets will be explicitly detailed.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their applications, but they do not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experimental results section**.

In **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, the authors mention using four datasets for their evaluations:

1. **Adding Problem Dataset**: This dataset is generated for a specific task where the input consists of random numbers and masks. However, it does not have a formal citation since it is a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of the experiment.

2. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification and is referenced as being generated in a previous work. The authors mention the citation:
   > Maas, A. L., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., and Potts, C. *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis*. In Proc. 49th Annual Meeting of the ACL, pp. 142–150, 2011.

3. **MNIST Dataset**: This well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification is referenced with the citation:
   > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., and Haffner, P. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

4. **Penn TreeBank (PTB) Dataset**: This dataset is used for language modeling and is cited as:
   > Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., and Marcinkiewicz, M. A. *Building a Large Annotated Corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313–330, 1993.

Next, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for the datasets mentioned. The IMDB and MNIST datasets have established citations, while the Adding Problem dataset is synthetic and does not require a citation. The Penn TreeBank dataset is also well-cited.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that the citations are accurate and complete.
