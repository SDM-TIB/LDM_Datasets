To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TweetBLM: A Hate Speech Dataset and Analysis of Black Lives Matter-related Microblogs on Twitter" by Sumit Kumar and Raj Ratn Pranesh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors have proposed a dataset called **TweetBLM**, which consists of 9,165 manually annotated tweets related to the Black Lives Matter movement. This is a clear indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will examine the **dataset section (Section 3)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. Here, they explain the data collection process, the criteria for tweet selection, and the annotation process. They confirm that the dataset contains 9,165 tweets, categorized into two classes: "HATE" and "NON-HATE." This section provides essential details about the dataset's composition and its purpose.

I will also look for any additional mentions of the dataset in the **experiments** and **results** sections to confirm its usage in the study. The authors discuss the dataset's application in various machine learning models for hate speech classification, reinforcing its significance in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is newly proposed in this paper, it may not have a separate citation. Instead, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Sumit Kumar and Raj Ratn Pranesh. *TweetBLM: A Hate Speech Dataset and Analysis of Black Lives Matter-related Microblogs on Twitter*. arXiv preprint arXiv:XXXX.XXXX, 2023.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset extracted from the paper.
