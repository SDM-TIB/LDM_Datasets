To extract datasets from the technical report titled "RangeAugment: Efficient Online Augmentation with Range Learning" by Sachin Mehta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **ImageNet dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for image classification tasks. This indicates that I should look for more details about this dataset in the paper.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned. In the **experimental setup** section, the authors specify that they used the **ADE20k dataset** for semantic segmentation tasks and the **MS COCO dataset** for object detection tasks. This is crucial information as it identifies multiple datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will look in the **References section** to find the appropriate citations:

1. **ImageNet Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248–255.

2. **ADE20k Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Zhou, B., Zhao, H., Puig, X., Fidler, S., Barriuso, A., & Torralba, A. (2017). *Scene parsing through ADE20k dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 633–641.

3. **MS COCO Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755.

After collecting the citations, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification with 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 categories.
- **ADE20k**: A dataset for semantic segmentation containing 20,000 training images and 2,000 validation images across 150 semantic classes.
- **MS COCO**: A dataset for object detection with approximately 118,000 training images and 5,000 validation images across 81 categories.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete for future reference or processing.
