To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physics Informed Machine Learning (PIML) methods for estimating the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) of aircraft engines" by Sriram Nagaraj and Truman Hickok, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors consider the **NASA Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS)** dataset as the main data for their research. This is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their study.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the dataset. The introduction discusses predictive maintenance and mentions the C-MAPSS dataset again, reinforcing its importance in the context of remaining useful lifetime (RUL) predictions.

I will then look into the **experiments** section, specifically under the subsection titled **Dataset**. Here, the authors provide a detailed description of the C-MAPSS dataset, noting that it is organized into four subsets corresponding to different aircraft operating conditions. Each subset contains synthetic sensor readings meant to simulate run-to-failure trajectories of turbofan engines. This section confirms that the C-MAPSS dataset is indeed the primary dataset used for their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The C-MAPSS dataset is referenced in the context of previous work, and I will locate the original source of the dataset. The citation for the C-MAPSS dataset is as follows:

- **C-MAPSS Dataset**: 
  > Saxena, A., Celaya, J. R., Saha, B., & Goebel, K. (2008). Damage propagation modeling for aircraft engine run-to-failure simulation. *Aerospace Science and Technology*, 12(4), 277-288.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: C-MAPSS Dataset
   - **Description**: A well-studied benchmark dataset for prognostics and health management research, consisting of multiple simulated engine run-to-failure trajectories with sensor measurements and corresponding remaining useful life (RUL) labels.
   - **Citation**: Saxena, A., Celaya, J. R., Saha, B., & Goebel, K. (2008). Damage propagation modeling for aircraft engine run-to-failure simulation. *Aerospace Science and Technology*, 12(4), 277-288.

With this information, I am ready to compile the dataset entry for further processing or review.
