To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Pretrained Cross-Lingual Language Models via Self-Labeled Word Alignment" by Zewen Chi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention conducting extensive experiments on a wide range of cross-lingual understanding tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors specifically mention the following datasets:

1. **MultiUN**: This dataset is used for translation tasks and is derived from the United Nations documents. It includes parallel corpora for multiple languages.
   
2. **IIT Bombay**: This dataset is a parallel corpus for English-Hindi translations, which is also utilized in their experiments.

3. **OPUS**: A collection of parallel corpora from various sources, which supports multiple language pairs.

4. **WikiMatrix**: This dataset contains parallel sentences mined from Wikipedia, covering a wide range of languages.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
