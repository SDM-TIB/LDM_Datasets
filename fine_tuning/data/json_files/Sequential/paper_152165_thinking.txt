To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Phenotyping of Clinical Time Series with LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks" by Zachary C. Lipton et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data description sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the application of LSTM RNNs to multilabel classification of diagnoses based on clinical measurements, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of RNNs to health data, but I need to focus on the **data description section** for specific dataset details. Here, the authors describe a collection of clinical time series data extracted from the electronic health records system at Children’s Hospital LA. They specify that the dataset consists of **10,401 PICU episodes**, each containing multivariate time series data with 13 variables.

Next, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Clinical Time Series Dataset**: This dataset includes 10,401 episodes of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients, with each episode being a multivariate time series of 13 clinical variables. The episodes vary in length from 12 hours to 30 days and are associated with diagnostic labels from an in-house taxonomy.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors refer to the dataset as being part of an IRB-approved study and mention the source as the electronic health records system at Children’s Hospital LA. However, there is no specific citation for the dataset itself in the references, as it is likely considered proprietary or internal data.

Since the dataset is derived from a clinical study, I will note that while there is no formal citation provided, the dataset can be referenced as follows:

- **Clinical Time Series Dataset**: 
  > Lipton, Z. C., Kale, D. C., & Wetzel, R. C. (Year). *Phenotyping of Clinical Time Series with LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks*. [Dataset description]. Children’s Hospital LA, Los Angeles, CA.

In this case, I will use the authors and title of the paper as a reference for the dataset, acknowledging that it is derived from their research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented and can be easily accessed or cited in future work.
