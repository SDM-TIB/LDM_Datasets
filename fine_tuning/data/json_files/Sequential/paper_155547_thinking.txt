To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rapid training of quantum recurrent neural networks" by Michał Siemaszko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the use of numerical simulations for evaluating the proposed Continuous-Variable Quantum RNN (CV-QRNN), which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe two specific tasks that involve datasets:

1. **Task 1 - Sequence Prediction and Forecasting**: The authors mention using the **Bessel function of degree 0, J0(x)**, to generate a sequence of 200 equidistant points for training and testing. This indicates that the Bessel function dataset is used for time series prediction.

2. **Task 2 - MNIST Image Classification**: The authors state that they used the **MNIST dataset** for classifying handwritten digits, specifically focusing on binary classification of digits '3' and '6'. This is a well-known dataset in machine learning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Bessel function dataset**, since it is a mathematical function rather than a traditional dataset, I will note that it is generated based on the function itself and does not have a formal citation like a dataset would.

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li Deng. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digit Images for Machine Learning Research [Best of the Web]*. IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 29(6), 141–142, 2012. https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2012.2211477

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Bessel Function Dataset**: Generated from the Bessel function of degree 0, J0(x), used for time series prediction and forecasting.
2. **MNIST Dataset**: A dataset of handwritten digits used for classification tasks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MNIST dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.
