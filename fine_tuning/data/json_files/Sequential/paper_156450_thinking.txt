To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Symmetric Temporally Sparse BPTT for Efficient RNN Training" by Xi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved significant reductions in matrix operations while training on the **Fluent Speech Commands dataset** and the **Google Speech Command Dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for detailed descriptions of how these datasets were used. In the experiments, the authors explicitly state that they used the **Fluent Speech Commands Dataset (FSCD)**, which contains 30,043 utterances from 97 speakers, and the **Google Speech Command Dataset (GSCD)**, which includes 105,829 utterances of 35 English words. This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their research.

I will also look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For the **Fluent Speech Commands Dataset**, the citation is:
> Lugosch, L., Ravanelli, M., Ignoto, P., Tomar, V. S., & Bengio, Y. (2019). Speech Model Pre-Training for End-to-End Spoken Language Understanding. In Proc. Interspeech 2019, 814â€“818.

For the **Google Speech Command Dataset**, the citation is:
> Warden, P. (2018). Speech commands: A dataset for limited-vocabulary speech recognition. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.03209.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in any subsequent work.
