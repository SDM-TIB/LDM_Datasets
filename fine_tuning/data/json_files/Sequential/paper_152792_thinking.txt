To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Non-saturating Recurrent Units for Modelling Long-term Dependencies" by Sarath Chandar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several tasks and datasets used in their experiments:

1. **Penn Treebank Corpus (PTB)**: This dataset is used for character-level language modeling. The authors reference it in the context of evaluating their model's performance on language tasks.

2. **Permuted Sequential MNIST**: This dataset is used to assess the model's ability to handle complex long-term dependencies. The authors describe the task and how it is structured.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Penn Treebank Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313â€“330.

- For the **Permuted Sequential MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Le, Q. V., Jaitly, N., & Hinton, G. E. (2015). A simple way to initialize recurrent networks of rectified linear units. *CoRR*, abs/1504.00941.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
