To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What we really want to find by Sentiment Analysis: The Relationship between Computational Models and Psychological State" by Hwiyeol Jo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained models using **365,802 movie review data**, which suggests a dataset is present.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **Data section**, the authors describe two main datasets:

1. **Psychological State Data**: This dataset includes psychological measurements of 64 participants, specifically their scores on the Positive Affective Negative Affective Schedule (PANAS) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). This dataset is crucial for understanding the relationship between sentiment analysis and psychological states.

2. **Movie Review Dataset**: The authors collected **365,802 movie reviews** from Naver, a popular Korean portal site. This dataset is used to train their sentiment analysis models. The reviews include titles, scores, and comments, and the authors implemented a web crawling tool to gather this data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **PANAS** and **CES-D** scales, the citations are:
  > Watson, D., Clark, L. A., & Tellegen, A. (1988). Development and validation of brief measures of positive and negative affect: the PANAS scales. Journal of personality and social psychology, 54(6), 1063.
  
  > Radloff, L. S. (1977). The CES-D scale: a self-report depression scale for research in the general population. Applied psychological measurement, 1(3), 385-401.

- For the **movie review dataset**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, it is derived from user-generated content on Naver, which is a widely recognized platform. Therefore, I will note it as:
  > Naver. (n.d.). Movie reviews dataset. Retrieved from [Naver website URL].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
