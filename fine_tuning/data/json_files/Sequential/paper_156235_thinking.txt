To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Change Detection for the Romanian Language" by Ciprian-Octavian Truic˘a, Victor Tudose, and Elena-Simona Apostol, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on both English and Romanian datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **SEMEVAL-CCOHA (SemEval Clean Corpus of Historical American English)**: This dataset is used to test different word embeddings and evaluate their performance before moving to the Romanian corpus. 

2. **RODICA (ROmanian DIachonic Corpus with Annotations)**: This dataset consists of 153 Romanian language news articles collected from various historical regions of Romania, spanning from the 19th century to the early 21st century.

In section 4.1, the authors provide additional details about the RODICA dataset, including its composition and the distribution of texts by region and date. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **SEMEVAL-CCOHA**, the citation is:
  > Dominik Schlechtweg, Barbara McGillivray, Simon Hengchen, Haim Dubossarsky, and Nina Tahmasebi. *SemEval-2020 task 1: Unsupervised lexical semantic change detection*. In Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pages 1–23, 2020. doi: 10.18653/v1/2020.semeval-1.1.

- For **RODICA**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is described in detail within the paper itself. Therefore, I will summarize the dataset's details based on the information provided in the text.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
