To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tag Prediction of Competitive Programming Problems using Deep Learning Techniques" by Taha Lokat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors scraped a dataset from Codeforces, which is a significant clue that I need to explore further.

Next, I will focus on the **Methodology** section, particularly the **Dataset Collection** subsection. Here, the authors describe how they gathered data from Codeforces, a competitive programming website. They mention that they scraped a total of **2400 problems** and preprocessed them, which is crucial information for the dataset description.

I will also look for any specific details about the dataset, such as its structure, the types of data included (problem statements and tags), and the preprocessing steps taken. The authors state that they ended up with **992 problems** and **3 tags** after cleaning the data, which is important for understanding the dataset's final composition.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Codeforces dataset. Since the dataset is derived from a website rather than a traditional publication, I will cite it as follows:

- For the **Codeforces dataset**, the citation is:
  > Codeforces. "Codeforces: Competitive Programming." Available at: https://codeforces.com/

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including the number of problems, the types of data included, and the source. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive understanding of the dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all citations are accurately represented.
