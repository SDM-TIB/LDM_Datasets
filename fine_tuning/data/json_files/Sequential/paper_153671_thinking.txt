To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MODRL/D-AM: Multiobjective Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Using Decomposition and Attention Model for Multiobjective Optimization" by Hong Wu, Jiahai Wang, and Zizhen Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a deep reinforcement learning method for multiobjective optimization, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention that the experiments are conducted on **Euclidean instances** and refer to datasets generated from distributions. They also mention using instances from **TSPLIB** for testing performance.

I will note the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **Euclidean Instances**: These instances are generated with node features sampled from the range [0, 1] × [0, 1]. However, the paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset as it is generated for the purpose of the experiments.

2. **TSPLIB**: The authors mention using specific instances from TSPLIB, namely **kroAB100**, **kroAB150**, and **kroAB200**. These are standard datasets used for testing algorithms related to the traveling salesman problem.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the TSPLIB datasets:

- For **TSPLIB**, the citation is:
  > Reinelt, G. (1991). TSPLIB–traveling salesman problem library. *ORSA Journal on Computing*, 3(4), 376–384.

Since the Euclidean instances are not formally cited and are generated by the authors, I will not include a citation for them.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the TSPLIB datasets in my output. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the datasets used in the research.
