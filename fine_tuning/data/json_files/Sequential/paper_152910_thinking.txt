To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying Offensive Posts and Targeted Offense from Twitter" by Haimin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions participation in SemEval 2019 Task 6, which indicates that there is a dataset involved. The introduction provides context about the problem being addressed, but I need to focus on sections that explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the dataset was collected through the Twitter API, focusing on tweets containing specific keyword patterns related to offensive language. The paper states that the final dataset consists of **14,100 tweets**, with **13,240 for training** and **860 for testing**. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's collection process and its annotation.

The authors reference the dataset's details and its collection process, including the use of the crowdsourcing platform Figure Eight for annotation. They also mention discrepancies in the annotations, which is important for understanding the dataset's quality.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to the SemEval 2019 Task 6 dataset, which is crucial for my citation. The relevant citation is:

- For the SemEval 2019 Task 6 dataset, the citation is:
  > Marcos Zampieri, Shervin Malmasi, Preslav Nakov, Sara Rosenthal, Noura Farra, and Ritesh Kumar. *SemEval-2019 Task 6: Identifying and Categorizing Offensive Language in Social Media (OffensEval)*. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval), 2019.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and its citation clearly. The dataset is specifically designed for identifying and categorizing offensive language in social media, which aligns with the paper's focus.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information and its citation into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
