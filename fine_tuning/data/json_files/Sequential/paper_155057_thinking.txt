To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stock Price Prediction Under Anomalous Circumstances" by Jinlong Ruan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on stock prices and mentions the use of data from 100 companies, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look closely at the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled **Stock Data Collection**. Here, the authors describe how they collected stock data using the `pandas_datareader.data` library, specifically downloading data for 100 stocks from Yahoo Finance. They mention that the data includes daily high prices, low prices, closing prices, adjusted closing prices, and volumes from the years 2016 to 2019.

In addition, I will check the **sentiment analysis subsection** where the authors explain that they scraped comments from Reddit using the Pushshift Reddit API to gather sentiment data related to the stocks. This indicates another dataset that is crucial for their analysis.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **Stock Price Dataset**: This dataset consists of daily adjusted closing prices for 100 stocks across 20 industries, collected from Yahoo Finance. The dataset spans from 2016 to 2019 and includes various stock metrics.

2. **Reddit Sentiment Dataset**: This dataset is derived from comments scraped from various subreddits related to stocks, specifically during anomalous periods. The sentiment scores are calculated using the VADER sentiment analysis algorithm.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately documented their details and citations for further processing or review. This structured approach will help in maintaining clarity and completeness in the dataset extraction process.
