To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Metaphorical User Simulators for Evaluating Task-oriented Dialogue Systems" by Weiwei Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted using three TDS datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look specifically for sections that detail the datasets used. In this case, the **Experiments section** (Section 5) is likely to contain the most relevant information. Here, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **MultiWOZ**: A multi-domain task-oriented dialogue dataset that spans seven domains and contains about 10,000 dialogues. The authors provide a brief description of its structure and the types of annotations it includes.

2. **ReDial**: A conversational recommendation dataset consisting of over 10,000 conversations where users recommend movies to each other. The authors explain how they adapted this dataset for task-oriented dialogue.

3. **JDDC**: A large-scale Chinese e-commerce conversation corpus with over 1 million dialogues. The authors describe how they processed this dataset for their experiments.

Additionally, the authors mention the **USS dataset**, which provides user satisfaction annotations for the three datasets mentioned above. This dataset is also relevant for understanding the evaluation of the user simulators.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

- For **MultiWOZ**, the citation is:
  > Eric, M., Goel, R., Paul, S., Kumar, A., Sethi, A., Goyal, A. K., Ku, P., Agarwal, S., & Gao, S. (2020). MultiWOZ 2.1: A Consolidated Multi-Domain Dialogue Dataset with State Corrections and State Tracking Baselines. In Proceedings of the Twelfth Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC ’20), 422–428.

- For **ReDial**, the citation is:
  > Li, R., Ebrahimi Kahou, S., Schulz, H., Michalski, V., Charlin, L., & Pal, C. J. (2018). Towards Deep Conversational Recommendations. ArXiv abs/1812.07617.

- For **JDDC**, the citation is:
  > Chen, M., Liu, R., Shen, L., Yuan, S., Zhou, J., Wu, Y., He, X., & Zhou, B. (2020). The JDDC Corpus: A Large-Scale Multi-Turn Chinese Dialogue Dataset for E-commerce Customer Service. In Proceedings of the Twelfth Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC ’20), 459–466.

- For **USS**, the citation is:
  > Sun, W., Zhang, S., Balog, K., Ren, Z., Ren, P., Chen, Z., & de Rijke, M. (2021). Simulating User Satisfaction for the Evaluation of Task-oriented Dialogue Systems. In Proceedings of the 44th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR ’21), 2499–2506.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
