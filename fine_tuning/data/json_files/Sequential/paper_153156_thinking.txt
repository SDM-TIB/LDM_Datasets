To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Augmenting a BiLSTM tagger with a Morphological Lexicon and a Lexical Category Identification Step" by Steinþór Steingrímsson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors trained and tested their tagger on a new gold standard for Icelandic, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Data section** (Section 2) where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **Icelandic Frequency Dictionary (IFD) Corpus**: This corpus is described as a balanced dataset containing about 590,000 tokens, collected from various texts, primarily fiction, biographies, and scholarly work. The authors specify that they used a corrected version of this corpus with a reduced tagset.

2. **MIM-GOLD Corpus**: This is a newer gold standard for Icelandic, which contains a greater diversity of texts compared to IFD, including news media, blogs, and parliamentary speeches. It consists of approximately 1 million running words and uses the same reduced tagset of 565 tags as IFD.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The citations I find are:

- For the **Icelandic Frequency Dictionary (IFD) Corpus**:
  > Jörgen Pind, Friðrik Magnússon, and Stefán Briem. *Íslensk orðtíðnibók [The Icelandic Frequency Dictionary]*. The Institute of Lexicography, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland, 1991.

- For the **MIM-GOLD Corpus**:
  > Sigrún Helgadóttir, Ásta Svavarsdóttir, Eiríkur Rögnvaldsson, Kristín Bjarnadóttir, and Hrafn Loftsson. *The Tagged Icelandic Corpus (MÍM)*. In Proceedings of SaLTMiL-AfLaT Workshop on Language technology for normalisation of less-resourced languages, LREC 2012, Istanbul, Turkey.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
