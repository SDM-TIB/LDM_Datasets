To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Talking Face Landmarks from Speech" by Seﬁk Emre Eskimez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their system on frontal videos of 27 different speakers, which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Proposed Method)**, particularly the subsection **3.1 (Training Data & Feature Extraction)**, where the authors mention using the **GRID audio-visual dataset** for training their system. This section provides details about the dataset, including the number of speakers and utterances, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

In addition, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the **experiments section**. The authors refer to the **LDC Audiovisual Database of Spoken American English dataset** for evaluation purposes. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **GRID audio-visual dataset**, the citation is:
   > Cooke, M., Barker, J., Cunningham, S., & Shao, X. (2006). An audio-visual corpus for speech perception and automatic speech recognition. *The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America*, 120(5), 2421–2424.

2. For the **LDC Audiovisual Database of Spoken American English**, the citation is:
   > Richie, S., Warburton, C., & Carter, M. (2009). Audiovisual database of spoken American English. Linguistic Data Consortium.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
