To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Subject Independent Emotion Recognition using EEG Signals Employing Attention Driven Neural Networks" by Arjun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their method using publicly available datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials and Methods)**, particularly the subsection titled **2.1 Dataset**. This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. The authors mention three datasets: 

1. **DEAP Dataset**: The paper describes this dataset as being acquired from 32 subjects who watched music videos while their EEG was recorded. The details about the number of channels, sampling rate, and the nature of the data are provided.

2. **SEED Dataset**: This dataset consists of EEG signals from 15 participants who watched movie clips. The authors provide information about the number of channels and the sampling rate, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

3. **CHB-MIT Dataset**: This dataset includes EEG recordings from 23 children with epilepsy. The authors describe the conditions under which the data was collected and the classification tasks they performed using this dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will then check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **DEAP Dataset**:

- For the **SEED Dataset**:
  > Zheng, W.-L., & Lu, B.-L. (2015). Investigating critical frequency bands and channels for EEG-based emotion recognition with deep neural networks. *IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development*, 7(2), 162-175. https://doi.org/10.1109/TAMD.2015.2431497.

  > Shoeb, A. (2009). Application of Machine Learning to Epileptic Seizure Onset Detection and Treatment. Ph.D. dissertation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Available at: https://physionet.org/content/chbmit/1.0.0/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
