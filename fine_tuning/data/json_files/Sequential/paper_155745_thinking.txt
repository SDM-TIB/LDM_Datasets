To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty-DTW for Time Series and Sequences" by Lei Wang and Piotr Koniusz, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a subsection that discusses datasets. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets used for their experiments, including:

1. **UCR Archive**: This dataset is described as a collection for time series classification, containing a variety of fields and lengths. It is a well-known resource in the time series analysis community.

2. **NTU RGB+D (NTU-60)**: This dataset contains 56,880 video sequences and over 4 million frames, with variable sequence lengths and high intra-class variations.

3. **NTU RGB+D 120 (NTU-120)**: An extension of NTU-60, this dataset includes 120 action classes and 114,480 RGB+D video samples captured from various viewpoints.

4. **Kinetics**: A large-scale dataset with 650,000 video clips covering multiple human action classes, including human-object and human-human interactions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **UCR Archive**:

- For **Kinetics**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant details while maintaining proper attribution to the original sources.
