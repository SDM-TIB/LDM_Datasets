To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Learning Framework for Predicting Digital Asset Price Movement from Trade-by-trade Data" by Qi Zhao, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses trade-by-trade data to predict price movements, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section I (Introduction)**, where the author discusses the challenges of predicting cryptocurrency prices and mentions the use of trade-by-trade data. This section provides context but does not specify the dataset details.

In **section III (Data, Feature Engineering)**, the author provides a detailed description of the dataset used for training the model. The key points include:

1. **Trade-by-Trade Data**: The dataset consists of 119,712,824 trade-by-trade data points for the BTC-USDT trading pair, covering the period from January 1, 2019, to November 30, 2019. This dataset is crucial for the study as it represents real-time price movements.

2. **Data Source**: The data was acquired from Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange, which is noted for its market depth and active user base.

In **section V (Experimental Results)**, the author mentions that the model was tested on out-of-sample data from December 1, 2019, to March 1, 2020, which further confirms the use of the BTC-USDT dataset for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. However, since the dataset is derived from trade data on Binance, it may not have a formal citation like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the source as follows:

- **BTC-USDT Trade-by-Trade Data**: 
  > Data acquired from Binance for the BTC-USDT trading pair, covering the period from January 1, 2019, to November 30, 2019.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation for the source of the data. 

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
