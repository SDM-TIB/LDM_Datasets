To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecasting the Spread of Covid-19 Under Control Scenarios Using LSTM and Dynamic Behavioral Models" by Seid Miad Zandavi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions that the model predicts the spread of Covid-19 across the top ten most-affected countries and Australia, indicating that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide more context about the data used. They mention that the data was collected from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) between December 31, 2019, and April 19, 2020. This suggests that the ECDC dataset is a primary source for their analysis.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any specific details about the datasets used in the modeling process. The authors state that they used data from the top ten most-affected countries, which include the USA, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, UK, Turkey, Iran, China, Russia, and Australia. This reinforces the idea that the dataset is comprehensive and includes multiple countries.

In the **results section**, the authors present their findings based on the data, but they do not introduce any new datasets. Instead, they focus on the performance of their model using the data they have already mentioned.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ECDC dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but they reference the ECDC website for data access. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is from the ECDC and provide the URL for reference.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset:

1. **ECDC Covid-19 Dataset**: This dataset includes data on Covid-19 cases and deaths across the top ten most-affected countries and Australia, collected from December 31, 2019, to April 19, 2020.

The citation for the dataset is:
> European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). *Geographic distribution of COVID-19 cases worldwide*. Available at: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
