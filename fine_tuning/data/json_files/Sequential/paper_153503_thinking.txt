To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Binarized Neural Architecture Search" by Hanlin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and conclusion sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed BNAS method achieves performance comparable to NAS on both **CIFAR** and **ImageNet** databases. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe their experimental setup, indicating that they conduct experiments on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and any specific configurations used during the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, stating it consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images across 10 classes, with images normalized to color intensities between [-1, +1]. They also mention that the **ImageNet** dataset is used for further evaluation, consisting of 1,000 classes with 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. (2015). *ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images across 10 classes, with images normalized to color intensities between [-1, +1].
   - Citation: Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer.

2. **ImageNet**: A dataset consisting of 1,000 classes with 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images.
   - Citation: Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. (2015). *ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
