To extract datasets from the research paper titled "M-MELD: A Multilingual Multi-Party Dataset for Emotion Recognition in Conversations" by Sreyan Ghosh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dataset called **M-MELD**, which is a multilingual extension of the **MELD** dataset. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to consider.

Next, I will look into **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for emotion recognition in conversations. They specifically mention **MELD** and its significance in the context of emotion recognition. This section also hints at the datasets being evaluated in their research.

In **section 3 (Multilingual MELD)**, the authors provide detailed information about the **M-MELD** dataset. They describe it as consisting of over 4504 human-annotated dialogues and 45871 utterances across four languages: Greek, Polish, French, and Spanish. This section outlines the dataset's structure and its purpose in bridging the gap for emotion recognition in non-English languages.

I will also check the **References section** to gather full citations for both datasets mentioned:

1. For the **MELD dataset**, the citation is:
   > Soujanya Poria, Devamanyu Hazarika, Navonil Majumder, Gautam Naik, Erik Cambria, and Rada Mihalcea. "MELD: A multimodal multi-party dataset for emotion recognition in conversations." *arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.02508*, 2018.

2. For the **M-MELD dataset**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
   > Sreyan Ghosh, S Ramaneswaran, Utkarsh Tyagi, Harshvardhan Srivastava, Samden Lepcha, S Sakshi, and Dinesh Manocha. "M-MELD: A Multilingual Multi-Party Dataset for Emotion Recognition in Conversations." *arXiv preprint arXiv:XXXX.XXXXXX*, 2022. (Note: Replace "XXXX.XXXXXX" with the actual arXiv identifier if available.)

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both **MELD** and **M-MELD**. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
