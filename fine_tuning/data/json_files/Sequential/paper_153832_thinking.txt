To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stage-Wise Neural Architecture Search" by Artur Jordao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on **CIFAR**, **Tiny ImageNet**, and **ImageNet** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in detail, specifically mentioning the datasets used. They state that they conducted experiments on **CIFAR-10**, **Tiny ImageNet**, and **ImageNet** (both the original version and a downsampled version).

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of each dataset:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is widely used for training machine learning models.

2. **Tiny ImageNet**: This dataset is a smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes, with each image being 64x64 pixels.

3. **ImageNet**: The original ImageNet dataset contains over 14 million images across more than 20,000 categories. For this paper, the authors specifically mention using the 224x224 version and a downsampled 32x32 version.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. University of Toronto, Tech. Rep., 2009.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Y. Le and X. Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS231N, 2015.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng Su, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 115, no. 3, pp. 211-252, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details regarding the datasets used in the research.
