To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HyMo: Vulnerability Detection in Smart Contracts using a Novel Multi-Modal Hybrid Model" by Mohammad Khodadadi and Jafar Tahmoresnezhad, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset called **ScrawlD**, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will look for specific details about the datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their dataset as a combination of **ScrawlD** and **SmartBugs Dataset-Wild**. This indicates that both datasets are relevant for their experiments.

In the **dataset description**, the authors provide details about **ScrawlD**, stating that it contains 6,700 tagged Ethereum smart contracts from the real world, which are labeled with vulnerabilities. They also mention that the **SmartBugs Dataset-Wild** is used for additional labeled smart contracts focusing on arithmetic vulnerabilities.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **ScrawlD**, the citation is:
   > Yashavant, C.S., Kumar, S., Karkare, A. (2022). *ScrawlD: A dataset of real-world Ethereum smart contracts labelled with vulnerabilities*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.11409.

2. For **SmartBugs Dataset-Wild**, the citation is:
   > Durieux, T., Ferreira, J.F., Abreu, R., Cruz, P. (2020). *Empirical review of automated analysis tools on 47,587 Ethereum smart contracts*. In Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 530â€“541.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
