To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TAN-NTM: Topic Attention Networks for Neural Topic Modeling" by Madhur Panwar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors performed experiments on several benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three benchmark datasets: **20Newsgroups (20NG)**, **AGNews**, and **Yelp Review Polarity (YRP)**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including the number of training and testing documents, vocabulary size, and average document length.

The paper provides a summary table (Table 1) that outlines the statistics for each dataset, which will be useful for my extraction. I will ensure to note down the specific details for each dataset as follows:

1. **20Newsgroups (20NG)**: 
   - Number of training documents: 11,259
   - Number of testing documents: 7,488
   - Vocabulary size: 1,995
   - Average document length: 88.06

2. **AGNews**: 
   - Number of training documents: 96,000
   - Number of testing documents: 7,600
   - Vocabulary size: 27,881
   - Average document length: 22.72

3. **Yelp Review Polarity (YRP)**: 
   - Number of training documents: 447,873
   - Number of testing documents: 38,000
   - Vocabulary size: 20,001
   - Average document length: 54.46

After identifying the datasets, I will then look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **20Newsgroups (20NG)**, the citation is:
  > Lang, K. (1995). Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews. In *Machine Learning Proceedings 1995* (pp. 331-339). Elsevier.

- For **AGNews**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, X., Zhao, J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). Character-level convolutional networks for text classification. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* (pp. 649-657).

- For **Yelp Review Polarity (YRP)**, the citation is:
  > Yelp Dataset Challenge. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented.
