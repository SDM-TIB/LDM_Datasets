To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DCCRGAN: Deep Complex Convolution Recurrent Generator Adversarial Network for Speech Enhancement" by Huixiang Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but the details about datasets are often found in the experiments section.

In the **experiments section (Section IV)**, the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. They state that they used a dataset released by Valentini et al. for fair comparison. This dataset is generated from two open data sources: the **Voice Bank corpus** and **DEMAND**. The Voice Bank corpus is used as speech data, while DEMAND serves as environmental noise data.

Next, I will gather specific details about the datasets:

1. **Voice Bank corpus**: This dataset is divided into a training set composed of 28 speakers and a test set composed of 2 speakers. It contains a total of 11,572 utterances generated under various noisy conditions.

2. **DEMAND**: This dataset provides environmental noise data, which is combined with the Voice Bank corpus to create noisy training sets under different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Voice Bank corpus**, the citation is:
  > C. Veaux, J. Yamagishi, and S. King. "The voice bank corpus: Design, collection and data analysis of a large regional accent speech database." In 2013 International Conference Oriental COCOSDA held jointly with 2013 Conference on Asian Spoken Language Research and Evaluation (O-COCOSDA/CASLRE), 2013, pp. 1–4.

- For the **DEMAND dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Thiemann, N. Ito, and E. Vincent. "The diverse environments multi-channel acoustic noise database: A database of multichannel environmental noise recordings." The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, vol. 133, no. 5, pp. 3591–3591, 2013.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for further processing. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper.
