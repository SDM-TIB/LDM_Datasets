To extract datasets from the research paper titled "emoDARTS: Joint Optimisation of CNN & Sequential Neural Network Architectures for Superior Speech Emotion Recognition" by Thejan Rajapakshe et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their approach on three datasets: **IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV, and MSP-Podcast**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the study.

Next, I will delve into **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they specify that they utilized the **IEMOCAP dataset**, the **MSP-IMPROV dataset**, and the **MSP-Podcast dataset** for their experiments. The authors also describe the characteristics of these datasets, such as the number of sessions and the emotional labels used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For the **IEMOCAP dataset**, the citation is:
   > Busso, C., Bulut, M., Lee, C.-C., Kazemzadeh, A., Mower, E., Kim, S., Chang, J. N., Lee, S., & Narayanan, S. S. (2008). IEMOCAP: Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture Database. *Language Resources and Evaluation*, 42(4), 335.

2. For the **MSP-IMPROV dataset**, the citation is:
   > Busso, C., Parthasarathy, S., Burmania, A., AbdelWahab, M., Sadoughi, N., & Provost, E. M. (2017). MSP-IMPROV: An Acted Corpus of Dyadic Interactions to Study Emotion Perception. *IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing*, 8(1), 67-80.

3. For the **MSP-Podcast dataset**, the citation is:
   > Lotfian, R., & Busso, C. (2019). Building Naturalistic Emotionally Balanced Speech Corpus by Retrieving Emotional Speech from Existing Podcast Recordings. *IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing*, 10(4), 471-483.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
