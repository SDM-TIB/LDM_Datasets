To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Low-Dimensional Linear Geometry of Contextualized Word Representations" by Evan Hernandez and Jacob Andreas, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction. Here, the authors discuss the use of probing models but do not specify datasets yet.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Method)**, which outlines the experiments conducted. In **section 4.1 (Tasks)**, the authors mention that they use the **Penn Treebank** for training and evaluating their probes. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Penn Treebank dataset. The citation is as follows:
- **Penn Treebank**: 
  > Mitchell P. Marcus, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, and Beatrice Santorini. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Comput. Linguist., 19(2):313â€“330, 1993.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In **section 4.2 (Representations)**, the authors mention using representations from **ELMo** and **BERT**, but these are not datasets; they are models that utilize datasets for training.

In summary, the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper is the **Penn Treebank**. I will compile this information, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the information gathered, ensuring that the citation is included for clarity and completeness.
