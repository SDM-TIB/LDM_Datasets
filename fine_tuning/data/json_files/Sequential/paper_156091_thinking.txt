To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UNITE: A Unified Benchmark for Text-to-SQL Evaluation" by Wuwei Lan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the UNITE benchmark is composed of publicly available text-to-SQL datasets from over 12 domains, which indicates that multiple datasets are included. The introduction further elaborates on the limitations of existing datasets and emphasizes the need for a comprehensive evaluation framework, hinting at the datasets that will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (UNITE Benchmark)**, particularly the **subsection 2.1 (Selection Criteria)**, where the authors list various datasets included in the benchmark. Here, I will identify each dataset mentioned, along with any relevant details provided about them.

The datasets explicitly mentioned in this section include:

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile their full citations accurately as they are crucial for proper referencing. This will involve cross-referencing the citations with the references section of the paper to ensure accuracy.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy access and review.
