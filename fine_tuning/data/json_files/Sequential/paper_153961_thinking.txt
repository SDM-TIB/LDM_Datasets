To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Neural Networks for Handover Management in Next-Generation Self-Organized Networks" by Zoraze Ali et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a handover management scheme and mentions the use of a high-fidelity network simulator (ns-3) to extract data, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **Section II (Data Generation)**, where the authors describe the simulation scenario and the dataset creation process. In **Section II-B (Dataset creation)**, the authors explicitly mention that they extracted 84 measurements from various layers of the LTE protocol stack to create their dataset. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's structure and the features included.

The dataset is described as a matrix of input features and output features, with specific measurements listed in **Table II**. The authors explain that the dataset consists of input features related to the LTE protocol stack and the output feature being the file download time. This indicates that the dataset is comprehensive and structured for regression analysis.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the ns-3 simulator, which is essential for understanding the context of the dataset:

- For the **ns-3 simulator**, the citation is:
  > N. Baldo, M. Miozzo, M. Requena-Esteso, and J. Nin-Guerrero. *An open source product-oriented LTE network simulator based on ns-3*. In Proceedings of the 14th ACM International Conference on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems, ser. MSWiM ’11. New York, NY, USA: ACM, 2011, pp. 293–298.

Additionally, the authors mention that the dataset is built upon measurements that are part of the Minimization of Drive Test (MDT) functionality, which is defined in the 3GPP standards:

- For the **3GPP TS 36.331**, the citation is:
  > 3GPP TS 36.331. *Radio measurement collection for Minimization of Drive Tests (MDT); Overall description*, version 10.4.0, Release 10.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
