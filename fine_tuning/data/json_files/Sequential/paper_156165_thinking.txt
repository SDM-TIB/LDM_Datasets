To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Edge-Aware Mirror Network for Camouflaged Object Detection" by Dongyue Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors indicate that their method is evaluated on "three widely used COD datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this case, they mention three datasets: **COD10K**, **NC4K**, and **CAMO**. I will look for specific details about each dataset, such as the number of samples and any unique characteristics that are highlighted.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide the following details:

1. **COD10K**: This dataset consists of 5,066 samples and is noted as the most challenging dataset, containing 78 subclasses. The authors use 3,040 samples for training and the rest for testing.

2. **NC4K**: This dataset contains 4,121 samples and is used to evaluate the generalization ability of their method.

3. **CAMO**: This dataset includes 1,250 samples and is also widely used for camouflaged object detection.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **COD10K**, the citation is:
  > Deng-Ping Fan, Ge-Peng Ji, Guolei Sun, Ming-Ming Cheng, Jianbing Shen, and Ling Shao. “Camouflaged object detection.” In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 2020, pp. 2777–2787.

- For **NC4K**, the citation is:
  > Yunqiu Lv, Jing Zhang, Yuchao Dai, Aixuan Li, Bowen Liu, Nick Barnes, and Deng-Ping Fan. “Simultaneously localize, segment and rank the camouflaged objects.” In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2021, pp. 11591–11601.

- For **CAMO**, the citation is:
  > Trung-Nghia Le, Tam V Nguyen, Zhongliang Nie, Minh-Triet Tran, and Akihiro Sugimoto. “Anabranch network for camouflaged object segmentation.” Computer vision and image understanding, vol. 184, pp. 45–56, 2019.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
