To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bitcoin Versus S&P500 Index: Return and Risk Analysis" by A.H. Nzokem, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions that the paper analyzes daily return distributions for Bitcoin and the S&P 500 index, which indicates that these two datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific details in the **methodology** and **analysis** sections. In the introduction, the author states that they will analyze daily return data for Bitcoin and the S&P 500 index over specific time periods. This suggests that I should look for the exact time frames and sources of these datasets.

In the **overview and trends section**, the author specifies that the S&P 500 data was extracted from Yahoo Finance, covering the period from April 28, 2013, to June 22, 2023. The Bitcoin price data was sourced from CoinMarketCap, spanning from January 04, 2010, to June 16, 2023. This information is crucial for documenting the datasets.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. The citations will be based on the references provided in the paper.

1. **S&P 500 Index Dataset**:
   - Description: Daily return data for the S&P 500 index.
   - Time Period: April 28, 2013, to June 22, 2023.
   - Source: Yahoo Finance.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
