To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Certified Robustness to Programmable Transformations in LSTMs" by Yuhao Zhang, Aws Albarghouthi, and Loris D’Antoni, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on three datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **Experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluations:

1. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being used for sentiment analysis, containing movie reviews with binary labels. 

2. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: This dataset is mentioned as containing reviews in a constituency parse tree form with five labels.

3. **SST2**: This is a two-way class split of the SST dataset, also used for sentiment analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142–150, Portland, Oregon, USA, 2011.

- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631–1642, Seattle, Washington, USA, 2013.

- For **SST2**, the citation is typically derived from the SST citation, as it is a subset of the same dataset.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited.
