To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Interpretable Hybrid Predictive Model of COVID-19 Cases using Autoregressive Model and LSTM" by Yangyi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted numerical studies on two data sources, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **results** sections. In the paper, the authors mention using two primary data sources:

1. **California County COVID-19 Data**: This dataset includes information on populations, positive and total tests, number of deaths, and positive cases across 8 California counties. The authors state that this data is available in the CHHS Open Data repository.

2. **WHO COVID-19 Data**: This dataset contains official daily counts of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccine utilization reported by various countries, territories, and areas. The authors specifically mention using data from 7 countries: Japan, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Singapore, Italy, and the United Kingdom.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **California County COVID-19 Data**, the citation is:
  > California Department of Public Health. *COVID-19 Time-Series Metrics by County and State*. Available at: https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-time-series-metrics-by-county-and-state.

- For the **WHO COVID-19 Data**, the citation is:
  > World Health Organization. *WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard*. Available at: https://covid19.who.int/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the study, along with their full citations, to facilitate any future referencing or analysis.
