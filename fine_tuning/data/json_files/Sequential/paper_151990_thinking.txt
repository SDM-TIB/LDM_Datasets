To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discrete-Event Continuous-Time Recurrent Nets" by Michael C. Mozer, Denis Kazakov, and Robert V. Lindsey, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors examined performance on "eleven data sets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant subsections within the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in section 3, where they mention various datasets used for testing their models.

Upon reviewing section 3.2, I find the following datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **Reddit Dataset**: This dataset consists of sequences of subreddit postings from 30,733 users, with sequences ranging from 30 to 976 postings. The task is to predict the next subreddit a user will post to.

2. **Last.fm Dataset**: This dataset includes sequences of musical artist selections from 30,000 individuals, with a total of 300 selections per individual. The task is similar to the Reddit dataset, focusing on predicting the next artist selection.

3. **Msnbc Dataset**: This dataset comprises sequences of categorized MSNBC web pages viewed in 120,000 sessions. The sequences range from 9 to 99 selections.

4. **Spanish Dataset**: This dataset consists of retrieval practice trials from 180 students studying Spanish vocabulary items over a semester. The task involves predicting trial-to-trial accuracy based on the students' study history.

5. **Japanese Dataset**: This dataset is from a controlled study of learning Japanese vocabulary, involving 32 participants and 60 vocabulary items over 84 days.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used, but it does reference the original studies or sources where these datasets can be found. 

For the **Reddit Dataset**, the citation is:
> Lindsey, R. V., Shroyer, J. D., Pashler, H., & Mozer, M. C. (2014). Improving students’ long-term knowledge retention through personalized review. *Psychological Science*, 25(3), 639-647.

For the **Last.fm Dataset**, the citation is:
> The Last.fm dataset is commonly referenced in music recommendation literature, but specific citation details are not provided in this paper.

For the **Msnbc Dataset**, the citation is:
> Lichman, M. (2013). UCI machine learning repository. 

For the **Spanish Dataset**, the citation is:
> Lindsey, R. V., Shroyer, J. D., Pashler, H., & Mozer, M. C. (2014). Improving students’ long-term knowledge retention through personalized review. *Psychological Science*, 25(3), 639-647.

For the **Japanese Dataset**, the citation is:
> Lindsey, R. V., Shroyer, J. D., Pashler, H., & Mozer, M. C. (2014). Improving students’ long-term knowledge retention through personalized review. *Psychological Science*, 25(3), 639-647.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries along with their citations to ensure that I have a complete and accurate representation of the datasets used in this research paper. This will be crucial for any further analysis or referencing in future work.
