To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Hebbian Learning on Point Sets in StarCraft II" by Beomseok Kang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions a novel Hebbian learning method applied to point sets in StarCraft II, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to the game.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Overview)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they extracted data from open-source replay videos provided by Blizzard, specifically using Terran versus Terran replay games. This indicates that the dataset is derived from gameplay data.

In this section, the authors detail how they extracted the position of all units every 0.2 seconds, and they describe the format of the data, which includes two types: one as a set of x and y positions and the other as binary image data representing the game map. This is crucial information for understanding the dataset's structure.

The authors also mention that they used the PySC2 package to extract the data, which is a significant detail that can help in locating the dataset or similar datasets in the future.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PySC2 package, as it is essential to provide proper attribution for the tools used in the dataset extraction. The relevant citation for PySC2 is:
> Vinyals, O., et al. "Starcraft II: A new challenge for reinforcement learning." arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.04782, 2021.

Additionally, I will note that the dataset is based on gameplay data from StarCraft II, which is publicly available through Blizzard's GitHub repository. The specific link provided in the paper is:
> GitHub: https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#downloads

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for both the dataset and the tools used to extract it.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **StarCraft II Replay Dataset**: Extracted from open-source replay videos provided by Blizzard, specifically for Terran versus Terran games. The data includes unit positions and binary image representations of the game map.
   - Citation for PySC2: Vinyals, O., et al. "Starcraft II: A new challenge for reinforcement learning." arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.04782, 2021.
   - GitHub link: https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#downloads

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
