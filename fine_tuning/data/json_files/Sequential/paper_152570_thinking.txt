To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Information-Weighted Neural Cache Language Models for ASR" by Lyan Verwimp et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving improvements on the **WikiText-2 dataset** and the **WSJ ASR task**, indicating that these are datasets used in their research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about their experimental setup. They explicitly state that they trained their language models on the **WikiText-2 dataset**, which contains 2 million words for training, 220,000 words for validation, and 250,000 words for testing. This section confirms that WikiText-2 is a primary dataset used in their experiments.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **Wall Street Journal (WSJ)** dataset for automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks. They describe the training data for the LSTM language models as consisting of 37 million words, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets:

- For the **WikiText-2 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, and Richard Socher. *Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017.

- For the **WSJ dataset**, the citation is:
  > Daniel Povey, Arnab Ghoshal, Gilles Boulianne, Lukas Burget, Ondrej Glembek, Nagendra Goel, Mirko Hannemann, Petr Motlicek, Yanmin Qian, Petr Schwarz, Jan Silovsky, Georg Stemmer, and Karel Vesely. *The Kaldi Speech Recognition Toolkit*. In IEEE 2011 Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding (ASRU), 2011.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
