To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structured in Space, Randomized in Time: Leveraging Dropout in RNNs for Efficient Training" by Anup Sarma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on three representative NLP tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors discuss their experiments in detail. This section is likely to contain specific mentions of the datasets used for each task.

1. **Language Modelling**: The authors mention using the **Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset** for language modeling experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its composition of training, validation, and test words.

2. **Machine Translation**: The paper discusses experiments on two datasets:
   - **IWSLT’14 German-English (De-En)**: The authors state that this dataset consists of 153k sentence pairs.
   - **IWSLT’15 English-Vietnamese (En-Vi)**: This dataset contains 133k training sentence pairs.

3. **Named Entity Recognition**: The authors refer to the **CoNLL-2003 shared task dataset**, which includes 204k training tokens, 51k development tokens, and 46k test tokens.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Penn Treebank (PTB)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330. URL: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J93-2004.

- For the **IWSLT datasets**, the citations are:
  > Luong, M.-T., Pham, H., & Manning, C. D. (2015). Effective approaches to attention-based neural machine translation. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1508.04025*.

- For the **CoNLL-2003 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tjong Kim Sang, E. F., & De Meulder, F. (2003). Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition. In *Proceedings of the seventh conference on Natural Language Learning at HLT-NAACL 2003* (pp. 142-147).

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for proper attribution.
