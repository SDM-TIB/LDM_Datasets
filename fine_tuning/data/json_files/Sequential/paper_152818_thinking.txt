To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Financial Series Prediction Using Attention LSTM" by Sangyeon Kim and Myungjoo Kang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors focus on predicting the trends of the KOSPI 200 index using various deep learning models, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used in their study. They mention that the dataset consists of the KOSPI 200 index and various index parameters such as currency, global index, and commodities. They also specify the time frame for the training data (from the beginning of 2007 to the end of 2016) and the test data (from the first trading day of 2017 to the end of July 2018). This section provides crucial details about the dataset.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments** or **methodologies** sections, but it appears that the primary focus is on the KOSPI 200 index dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the KOSPI 200 index dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the KOSPI 200 index itself, as it is a widely recognized financial index. Instead, I will note that the dataset is derived from the Korean stock exchange and is commonly used in financial studies.

The relevant details I have gathered are as follows:

1. **KOSPI 200 Index Dataset**: This dataset includes the KOSPI 200 index, which is a weighted combination of the 200 most traded securities in the Korean stock exchange. The data spans from the beginning of 2007 to the end of 2016 for training and from the first trading day of 2017 to the end of July 2018 for testing.

Since the KOSPI 200 index is a well-known financial dataset, I will summarize the information without a specific citation, but I will note its significance in financial research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
