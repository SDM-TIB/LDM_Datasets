To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-time Federated Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search" by Hangyu Zhu and Yaochu Jin, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior work that utilized specific datasets. If the authors refer to datasets used in previous studies, I will note those down as they may be relevant to the current research.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss experimental setups or data sources. This section typically details the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its structure and the number of images it contains.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. For the CIFAR-10 dataset, I will look for the original source or any relevant papers that describe the dataset in detail. The citation for CIFAR-10 is:

- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. 

I will ensure that I format the citation correctly and include any additional details that may be relevant, such as the year of publication or the context in which the dataset was introduced.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the citations.
