To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Network Repair with Reachability Analysis" by Xiaodong Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the performance of the proposed framework on two types of benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the benchmarks used for evaluation. I will look for specific names of datasets or benchmarks that are explicitly mentioned. 

In the **experiments section**, the authors refer to two benchmarks:
1. **HorizontalCAS**: This is described as an airborne collision avoidance system that uses neural networks as controllers. The paper provides details about the input features and safety properties associated with this benchmark.
2. **Rocket Lander**: This benchmark simulates a vertical rocket landing model, and the authors describe the input features and safety properties relevant to this scenario.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not be explicitly listed as datasets but rather as papers or resources that describe the datasets.

For **HorizontalCAS**, the citation is:
> Julian, K., & Kochenderfer, M. J. (2019). Guaranteeing safety for neural network-based aircraft collision avoidance systems. In 2019 IEEE/AIAA 38th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC) (pp. 1-10). IEEE.

For **Rocket Lander**, the citation is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
