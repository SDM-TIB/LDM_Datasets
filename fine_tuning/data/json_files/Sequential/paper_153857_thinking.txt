To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable Entity Representations through Large-Scale Typing" by Yasumasa Onoe and Greg Durrett, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors discuss their approach to creating interpretable entity representations and mention using a fine-grained entity typing model trained on datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely to be detailed further in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Training Data)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for training their entity typing model. Here, they mention three key datasets:

1. **Wiki-Context**: This dataset is created from hyperlinks in Wikipedia, yielding 6 million training examples. It uses the hyperlink as the entity mention and the sentence containing the hyperlink as the context.

2. **Wiki-Description**: This dataset consists of 2 million training examples derived from the lead paragraphs of Wikipedia pages, where the page title serves as the entity mention and the surrounding text as context.

3. **UFET (Ultra-Fine Entity Typing)**: This dataset contains 6,000 manually annotated examples, which include various types of entity mentions.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **CoNLL-YAGO** dataset for coreference arc prediction and the **WikilinksNED** dataset for named entity disambiguation. These datasets are crucial for evaluating their model's performance.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **Wiki-Context**, the citation is:
  > Yasumasa Onoe and Greg Durrett. *Fine-Grained Entity Typing for Domain Independent Entity Linking*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2020.

- For **Wiki-Description**, the citation is the same as above since it is derived from the same work.

- For **UFET**, the citation is:
  > Eunsol Choi, Omer Levy, Yejin Choi, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *Ultra-Fine Entity Typing*. In Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2018.

- For **CoNLL-YAGO**, the citation is:
  > Johannes Hoffart et al. *Robust Disambiguation of Named Entities in Text*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2011.

- For **WikilinksNED**, the citation is:
  > Thibault FÃ©vry et al. *Entities as Experts: Sparse Memory Access with Entity Supervision*. ArXiv, 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper effectively.
