To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STAN: Spatio-Temporal Adversarial Networks for Abnormal Event Detection" by Sangmin Lee, Hak Gu Kim, and Yong Man Ro, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the method but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the context of abnormal event detection but does not name any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they state that they used three datasets: **UCSD Ped1**, **UCSD Ped2**, and **Avenue**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant to their research.

I will then look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets within the same section. The authors provide information about the training and testing sets for each dataset:

1. **UCSD Ped1**: Contains 34 clips for training and 36 clips for testing, focusing on the motion of small objects in a broad area.
2. **UCSD Ped2**: Comprises 16 clips for training and 12 clips for testing, also dealing with small object motion in a broad area.
3. **Avenue**: Includes 16 clips for training and 21 clips for testing, featuring complex motion of large objects and frequent occlusions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **UCSD Ped1 and UCSD Ped2**, the citation is:
  > Vijay Mahadevan, Weixin Li, Viral Bhalodia, and Nuno Vasconcelos. "Anomaly detection in crowded scenes." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1975–1981, 2010.

- For **Avenue**, the citation is:
  > Cewu Lu, Jianping Shi, and Jiaya Jia. "Abnormal event detection at 150 fps in matlab." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2720–2727, 2013.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
