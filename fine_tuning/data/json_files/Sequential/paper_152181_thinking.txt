To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Survey of reasoning using Neural Networks" by Amit Sahu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses various neural architectures and their applications, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the challenges in artificial intelligence and reasoning but still lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiment and Results)**, as this section typically contains details about the datasets used for experiments. Here, I find several mentions of datasets:

1. **QA dataset**: This dataset is introduced in the context of large-scale question answering (QA) experiments. It consists of 14 million statements stored as (subject, relation, object) triples, combined with pseudo-labeled QA pairs and paraphrased questions.

2. **Simulated World QA**: This dataset is generated from a simulation involving characters, objects, and rooms, resulting in 7,000 statements and 3,000 questions for training and testing.

3. **Synthetic QA tasks**: This dataset is used for experiments on various question-answering tasks, with 20 different types of tasks requiring different forms of reasoning and deduction.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely derived from the works referenced in the experiments. 

For the **QA dataset**, I can refer to the original paper:
- Fader, A., Zettlemoyer, L., & Etzioni, O. (2013). *Paraphrase-driven learning for open question answering*. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 1608â€“1618.

For the **Simulated World QA**, since it is based on the approach of another referenced work, I will cite:
- Bordes, A., Usunier, N., Collobert, R., & Weston, J. (2010). *Towards understanding situated natural language*. In Proceedings of the AISTATS.

For the **Synthetic QA tasks**, I will refer to:
- Weston, J., Bordes, A., Chopra, S., & Mikolov, T. (2015). *Towards AI-complete question answering: A set of prerequisite toy tasks*. arXiv:1502.05698.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with the full citation for future reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
