To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Neural Network Adaptation via Parameter Remapping and Architecture Search" by Jiemin Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the adaptation of a seed network (MobileNetV2) for segmentation and detection tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **subsection 4.1 (Network Adaptation on Semantic Segmentation)**, the authors mention using the **Cityscapes dataset** for semantic segmentation tasks. They provide details about the dataset's application in their experiments.

In **subsection 4.2 (Network Adaptation on Object Detection)**, the authors state that they used the **MS-COCO dataset** for object detection tasks. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Cityscapes dataset**, the citation is:
   > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In CVPR, 2016.

2. For the **MS-COCO dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge J. Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Doll√°r, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In ECCV, 2014.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now prepare to compile this information into the required format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
