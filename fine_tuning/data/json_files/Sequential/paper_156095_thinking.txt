To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compositional Generalization without Trees using Multiset Tagging and Latent Permutations" by Matthias Lindemann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions that the model outperforms others on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of compositional generalization and mention specific datasets. I will look for any named datasets or references to benchmarks that are used for evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors typically provide specifics about the datasets, including their sizes and characteristics. For example, they mention the **COGS** dataset and the **ATIS** dataset, which are crucial for their experiments.

I will also check the **appendices** or **supplementary materials** for additional details about the datasets, as authors sometimes include important information there that may not be in the main text.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile the following information:

1. **COGS Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of evaluating compositional generalization. The citation for COGS is:
   > Kim, N., & Linzen, T. (2020). COGS: A compositional generalization challenge based on semantic interpretation. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 9087â€“9105, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **ATIS Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as a benchmark for evaluating the model's performance. The citation for ATIS is:
   > Dahl, D. A., Bates, M., Brown, M., Fisher, W., Hunicke-Smith, K., Pallett, D., Pao, C., Rudnicky, A., & Shriberg, E. (1994). Expanding the scope of the ATIS task: The ATIS-3 corpus. In Human Language Technology: Proceedings of a Workshop held at Plainsboro, New Jersey, March 8-11, 1994.

3. **Okapi Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the model's performance in a more realistic setting. The citation for Okapi is:
   > Hosseini, S., Awadallah, A. H., & Su, Y. (2021). Compositional generalization for natural language interfaces to web APIs. arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.05209.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented each dataset's name, description, and full citation. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and facilitate further exploration by others interested in this work.
