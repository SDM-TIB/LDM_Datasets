To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Do LSTMs See Gender? Probing the Ability of LSTMs to Learn Abstract Syntactic Rules" by Priyanka Sukumaran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the model's ability to predict long-distance gender agreement, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to delve deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Language Model)**, where the authors describe the LSTM model they used. They mention that the LSTM was retrained on a French corpus from Mueller et al. (2020). This indicates that the dataset used for training the LSTM is relevant.

In **section 3 (Results)**, the authors refer to their model's performance on gender agreement tasks and mention that they tested subject-verb number agreement using the corpus from Mueller et al. (2020). This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset used. The relevant citation for the French corpus is:

- For the French corpus used in the study, the citation is:
  > Aaron Mueller, Garrett Nicolai, Panayiota Petrou-Zeniou, Natalia Talmina, and Tal Linzen. *Cross-linguistic syntactic evaluation of word prediction models*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 1-12, 2020.

Additionally, the authors reference other works that may not be datasets themselves but are relevant to the context of their research. However, the primary dataset they utilized for training and evaluation is the French corpus from Mueller et al. (2020).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation for the French corpus as it is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Investigate the language model section for details on the dataset used.
3. Confirm the dataset's relevance in the results section.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the findings.
