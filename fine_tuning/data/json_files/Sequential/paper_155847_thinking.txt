To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empirical Analysis of Limits for Memory Distance in Recurrent Neural Networks" by Steffen Illium et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction might mention datasets used for experiments or comparisons.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets utilized. In this case, the authors describe a "Random Memorization Task" and a "Fixed-Length Random Memorization Task," but they do not explicitly mention any external datasets. Instead, they indicate that they generated random sequences of numbers for their experiments.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets, I will note that the authors created their own synthetic data for the experiments. This is important to document, as it clarifies the source of the data used in their analysis.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that the authors consistently refer to the generated data and do not cite any external datasets. The results are based on the random sequences they created, which reinforces the idea that no external datasets were used.

Finally, I will compile my findings. Since there are no external datasets to cite, I will summarize the data generation process as follows:

- **Random Memorization Task**: The authors generated random-length sequences of random numbers uniformly sampled from [0; 1] for their experiments.
- **Fixed-Length Random Memorization Task**: The authors fixed the length of the random sequence to 10, again using random numbers uniformly sampled from [0; 1].

As there are no formal citations for datasets in this paper, I will note that the data is synthetic and generated by the authors themselves, which is a crucial detail for understanding the context of their experiments.

In conclusion, I will document the absence of external datasets and the use of synthetic data generated for the experiments in the final output.
