To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DREAM-Talk: Diffusion-based Realistic Emotional Audio-driven Method for Single Image Talking Face Generation" by Chenxu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of an emotion-conditioned diffusion model and references datasets like MEAD, which indicates that there are specific datasets involved in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss challenges in emotional talking face generation and mention the MEAD dataset explicitly. They also reference other datasets like VoxCeleb2 and RAVDESS, which are used in conjunction with MEAD for training purposes. This is a good indication that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

In the **method section**, particularly in subsection 3.1, the authors describe the creation of an ARKit-specific facial dataset derived from the MEAD emotion dataset. This indicates that the MEAD dataset is not only used but also modified for their specific needs. I will note this dataset as well.

Now, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used in their evaluations. The authors mention using the MEAD emotion dataset and the HDTF multi-character dataset for training their models. This confirms the importance of these datasets in their experiments.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **MEAD Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Kaisiyuan Wang, Qianyi Wu, Linsen Song, Zhuoqian Yang, Wayne Wu, Chen Qian, Ran He, Yu Qiao, and Chen Change Loy. *MEAD: A large-scale audio-visual dataset for emotional talking-face generation*. In ECCV, 2020.

2. **VoxCeleb2 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Joon Son Chung, Arsha Nagrani, and Andrew Zisserman. *VoxCeleb2: Deep Speaker Recognition*. In Proceedings of Interspeech, 2018.

3. **RAVDESS Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Steven R. Livingstone and Frank A. Russo. *The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS): A dynamic, multimodal set of facial and vocal expressions in North American English*. 2018.

4. **HDTF Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Zhimeng Zhang, Lincheng Li, Yu Ding, and Changjie Fan. *Flow-guided one-shot talking face generation with a high-resolution audio-visual dataset*. In CVPR, 2021.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
