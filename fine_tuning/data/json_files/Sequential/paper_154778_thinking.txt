To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Examining the Inductive Bias of Neural Language Models with Artificial Languages" by Jennifer C. White and Ryan Cotterell, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned or alluded to. The abstract discusses the use of artificial languages to investigate inductive biases in language models, which suggests that the datasets may be generated from these artificial languages rather than traditional datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Constructing Controlled Languages)**, where the authors describe the construction of probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) to create artificial languages. This section is likely to contain details about the datasets used for training and evaluating the language models. The authors mention generating 100,000 sentences for each of the 64 possible grammars, which indicates that these generated sentences serve as the dataset for their experiments.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors detail the experimental setup, including the training and evaluation of language models on these generated datasets. They specify that the sentences generated for each grammar differ only in the designated choice points, confirming that the datasets are indeed the artificial languages created through their methodology.

Now, I will look for any references to existing datasets or corpora that may have been used in conjunction with the artificial languages. However, the focus of this paper appears to be on the artificial datasets created by the authors themselves.

Since the datasets are generated from the authors' own grammars, I will note that the citation for the methodology used to create these datasets is as follows:

- For the artificial languages and grammars, the citation is:
  > White, J. C., & Cotterell, R. (2023). Examining the Inductive Bias of Neural Language Models with Artificial Languages. *Proceedings of the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems*.

I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the methodology used to create the datasets. This will provide a clear reference for anyone looking to understand the source of the datasets used in the experiments.
