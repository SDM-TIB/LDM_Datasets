To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning the grammar of prescription: recurrent neural network grammars for medication information extraction in clinical texts" by Ivan Lerner et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study evaluates a model on a French clinical corpus, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention the **APmed corpus**, which is a collection of clinical text reports in French. The section provides detailed statistics about the dataset, including the number of documents, tokens, and various entities and relations extracted from the corpus.

In the **dataset description**, I will note the following key points:
- The APmed corpus consists of 320 free text reports, including medical prescriptions and other clinical documents.
- It is specifically designed for drug information extraction, including drug names and their associated fields (e.g., frequency, dosage, duration).

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the APmed corpus. The citation is as follows:
> Jouffroy J, Feldman SF, Lerner I, Rance B, Burgun A, Neuraz A. *MedExt: combining expert knowledge and deep learning for medication extraction from French clinical texts (Preprint)*. doi: 10.2196/preprints.17934.

Since the APmed corpus is the primary dataset used in this study, I will create an entry for it, ensuring to include the full citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the citation is accurately represented.
