To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Multi-Frame Monocular Scene Flow" by Junhwa Hur and Stefan Roth, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the model is trained on the **KITTI dataset**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss their methodology and the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention using the **KITTI raw dataset** for self-supervised training and the **KITTI Scene Flow Training dataset** for evaluation. This confirms the use of these datasets in their experiments.

In the **implementation details**, the authors specify that they use the **KITTI Split** for training, which divides the dataset into training and validation sets. They also mention that they evaluate their model on the **KITTI Scene Flow Training dataset**, which provides ground truth for scene flow.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **KITTI dataset**:
   > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Christoph Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. Int. J. Robot. Res., 32(11):1231â€“1237, Aug. 2013.

2. **KITTI Scene Flow Training dataset**:
   > Moritz Menze, Christian Heipke, and Andreas Geiger. *Joint 3D estimation of vehicles and scene flow*. In ISPRS Workshop on Image Sequence Analysis (ISA), 2015.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
