To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Classifying Variational Autoencoder with Application to Polyphonic Music Generation" by Jay A. Hennig et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions applying the model to "algorithmic music generation," which suggests that datasets related to music are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **Data**. Here, the authors explicitly state the datasets used for training their models. They mention two specific datasets:

1. **JSB Chorales**: This dataset consists of 382 four-part harmonized chorales by J.S. Bach. The authors note that this corpus was used in its entirety and converted to piano-roll notation for their experiments.

2. **Piano-midi.de**: This dataset includes a collection of classical music by various composers. The authors also indicate that this dataset was processed similarly to the JSB Chorales.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models on these datasets, confirming their relevance and usage in the experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For the **JSB Chorales**, the citation is:
  > Nicolas Boulanger-Lewandowski, Yoshua Bengio, and Pascal Vincent. *Modeling temporal dependencies in high-dimensional sequences: Application to polyphonic music generation and transcription*. In ICML, 2012.

- For the **Piano-midi.de** dataset, the citation is:
  > Michael Scott Cuthbert and Christopher Ariza. *Music21, a toolkit for computer-aided musicology and symbolic music data*. In International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR), 2010.

Having gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately documented the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper citations.
