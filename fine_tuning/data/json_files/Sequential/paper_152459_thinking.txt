To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrently Exploring Class-wise Attention in A Hybrid Convolutional and Bidirectional LSTM Network for Multi-label Aerial Image Classification" by Yuansheng Hua et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of two datasets for evaluating the proposed model, which indicates that I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Data description)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **UCM Multi-label Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the UCM dataset and consists of 2100 aerial images, each labeled with one or more object-level labels. The authors provide details about the number of images per object category and the spatial resolution of the images.

2. **DFC15 Multi-label Dataset**: This dataset is built from the DFC15 semantic segmentation dataset and contains aerial images with pixel-level labels. The authors describe the process of creating the multi-label dataset from the original pixel-level annotations and provide information about the number of images and object classes.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **UCM Multi-label Dataset**, the citation is:
  > B. Demir, L. Bruzzone, Histogram-based attribute profiles for classification of very high resolution remote sensing images, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing 54 (4) (2016) 2096â€“2107.

- For the **DFC15 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > 2015 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest, http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion, online.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the names, descriptions, and full citations of the datasets mentioned in the paper, which are crucial for proper referencing and validation of the research findings.
