To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Do Deep Learning Models and News Headlines Outperform Conventional Prediction Techniques on Forex Data?" by Sucharita Atha and Bharath Kumar Bolla, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested various prediction techniques using external elements like news items, which suggests that datasets related to Forex market data and news headlines are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data Sourcing)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their research. They mention that the data comes from a prior work and is sourced from two main components:

1. **Market Data**: This dataset includes EUR/USD market rates for approximately five years, from November 2007 to September 2012. It consists of features such as Ask and Bid prices for currency pairs.

2. **News Headlines Data**: This dataset contains news headlines corresponding to the same time intervals as the market data, which are used for sentiment analysis.

The authors provide a URL for accessing the market data, which is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the prior work mentioned in section 4.1. The relevant reference is:

- For the dataset derived from the prior work:
  > A. Khadjeh Nassirtoussi, S. Aghabozorgi, T. Ying Wah, and D. C. L. Ngo. "Text mining of news-headlines for FOREX market prediction: A Multi-layer Dimension Reduction Algorithm with semantics and sentiment." *Expert Systems with Applications*, vol. 42, no. 1, pp. 306â€“324, 2015. doi: 10.1016/j.eswa.2014.08.004.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Market Data**: EUR/USD market rates from November 2007 to September 2012, including Ask and Bid prices.
   - Citation: A. Khadjeh Nassirtoussi et al. (2015).

2. **News Headlines Data**: News headlines corresponding to the market data time intervals for sentiment analysis.
   - Citation: A. Khadjeh Nassirtoussi et al. (2015).

Finally, I will compile these dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
