To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Syntactic Change Using a Neural Part-of-Speech Tagger" by William Merrill et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained a part-of-speech tagger on a large corpus of American English, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of the **Corpus of Historical American English (COHA)**, which is a significant dataset for their research. This is a promising lead, and I will need to gather more details about this dataset.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Data)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the COHA dataset. They state that COHA is composed of documents dating from 1810 to 2009, containing over 400 million words, and includes a balanced genre mix. They also mention that they randomly selected 50,000 sentences from each decade for a total of 1,000,000 sentences, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the COHA dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Mark Davies. 2010-. *The corpus of historical American English: 400 million words, 1810-2009*.

This citation is essential for proper attribution and will be included in the dataset entry.

Since the paper primarily discusses the COHA dataset and does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus solely on this dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. This will ensure that the dataset extraction is complete and ready for further processing or review.
