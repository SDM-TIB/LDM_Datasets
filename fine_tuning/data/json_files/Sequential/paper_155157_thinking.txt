To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expert Human-Level Driving in Gran Turismo Sport Using Deep Reinforcement Learning with Image-based Representation" by Ryuji Imamura et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often highlights the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention using Gran Turismo Sport (GTS) as a realistic racing simulator. This indicates that the game itself is a key component of the study, but I need to look for specific datasets or data collection methods mentioned in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe how they collected data for their experiments. They mention collecting approximately **630,000 game screen images** during their experiments, which is a significant dataset. This dataset is used for training the feature extraction network and is crucial for the reinforcement learning process.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail the evaluation of their controller against human players and the built-in AI. They do not mention any additional datasets beyond the game screen images collected from GTS, but they do provide context on how these images were used to train their model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, since the primary dataset is derived from the Gran Turismo Sport game itself, I will note that the game serves as the source of the dataset rather than a traditional dataset published in a separate paper.

The citation for the Gran Turismo Sport game is as follows:
> Polyphony Digital Inc. *Gran Turismo Sport*. PlayStation 4, 2017.

Since the paper primarily utilizes the game as a dataset source and does not reference any other external datasets, I will summarize the findings accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Gran Turismo Sport game as the dataset source.
