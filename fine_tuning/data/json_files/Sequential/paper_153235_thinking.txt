To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Multi-Kernel Convolutional LSTM Networks and an Attention-Based Mechanism for Videos" by Sebastian Agethen and Winston H. Hsu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on the **UCF-101** and **Sports-1M** datasets, which suggests that these are the primary datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **evaluation section**. The authors provide a description of both datasets:

1. **UCF-101 Dataset**: This dataset contains 13,320 videos, each depicting a single human action across 101 categories. The average length of the videos is 180 frames, and the dataset offers three different splits for training and testing.

2. **Sports-1M Dataset**: This dataset consists of over one million videos sourced from YouTube, categorized into 487 classes related to sports. The videos vary in length, from a few seconds to several hours, and the authors mention that they used a subset of 20 classes for their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **UCF-101 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > K. Soomro, A. R. Zamir, and M. Shah. "UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild." CoRR, vol. abs/1212.0402, 2012. Available: http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1212.html#abs-1212-0402

- For the **Sports-1M Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Karpathy, G. Toderici, S. Shetty, T. Leung, R. Sukthankar, and L. Fei-Fei. "Large-scale video classification with convolutional neural networks." In 2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, June 2014, pp. 1725â€“1732.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or application.
