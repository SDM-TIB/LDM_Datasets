To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hybrid CNN-BiLSTM Voice Activity Detector" by Nicholas Wilkinson and Thomas Niesler, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors compare their method with established baselines on the **AVA-Speech dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **data description section (Section 2)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the **AVA-Speech dataset**. They describe it as a publicly available dataset consisting of 160 segments from movies, totaling 40 hours of labeled data, with specific labels for speech activity. This section provides essential statistics and context about the dataset, confirming its significance in their research.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors reiterate their use of the **AVA-Speech dataset** for evaluating their model, which further solidifies its role in their study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **AVA-Speech dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- **AVA-Speech Dataset**: 
  > Chaudhuri, S., Roth, J., Ellis, D. P. W., Gallagher, A. C., Kaver, L., Marvin, R., Pantofaru, C., Reale, N., Reid, L. G., Wilson, K. W., & Xi, Z. (2018). *AVA-Speech: A densely labeled dataset of speech activity in movies*. In Proceedings of Interspeech, Graz, Austria.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **AVA-Speech dataset**.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the AVA-Speech dataset, ensuring it is ready for any further processing or review.
