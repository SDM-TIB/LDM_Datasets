To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ASFD: Automatic and Scalable Face Detector" by Bin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on popular benchmarks, specifically **WIDER FACE** and **FDDB**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors refer to **WIDER FACE** and **FDDB** multiple times throughout the text, particularly in the context of evaluating their proposed method.

Now, I will gather detailed information about each dataset:

1. **WIDER FACE**: This dataset is a well-known benchmark for face detection, containing a large number of images with varying levels of difficulty (easy, medium, hard). The authors mention that their model achieves state-of-the-art performance on this dataset.

2. **FDDB**: This dataset is another benchmark used for face detection, which focuses on detecting faces in unconstrained settings. The authors also report their model's performance on this dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

- For **WIDER FACE**, the citation is:
  > Yang, S., Luo, P., Loy, C.C., & Tang, X. (2016). WIDER Face: A face detection benchmark. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 5525â€“5533.

- For **FDDB**, the citation is:
  > Jain, V., & Learned-Miller, E. (2010). FDDB: A benchmark for face detection in unconstrained settings. Tech. rep., UMass Amherst technical report.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will allow me to create a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
