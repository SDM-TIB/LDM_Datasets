To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parallel WaveNet: Fast High-Fidelity Speech Synthesis" by Aaron van den Oord et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the WaveNet architecture and its applications in speech synthesis, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the WaveNet model and its improvements without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is typically where datasets used for training and evaluation are detailed. In this section, the authors mention that they used a "teacher WaveNet network" trained on a dataset of audio. However, they do not specify the dataset's name directly in this section.

I will then check the **references section** for any citations that might refer to datasets. The references include various papers, but I need to identify which ones are related to datasets used in their experiments. 

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite the original WaveNet paper, which is:
- **WaveNet**: 
  > Aaron van den Oord, Sander Dieleman, Heiga Zen, Karen Simonyan, Oriol Vinyals, Alex Graves, Nal Kalchbrenner, Andrew Senior, and Koray Kavukcuoglu. *Wavenet: A generative model for raw audio*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.03499, 2016.

This paper likely contains information about the dataset used for training the original WaveNet model. 

Additionally, I will look for any supplementary materials or appendices that might provide further details about the datasets. If the paper mentions specific datasets in the context of audio generation or training, I will note those down.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. If no specific datasets are named, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
