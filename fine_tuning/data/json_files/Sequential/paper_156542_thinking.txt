To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ransomware detection using stacked autoencoder for feature selection" by Mike Nkongolo and Mahmut Tokmak, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **UGRansome dataset** for ransomware detection, which is a clear indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of ransomware detection and the lack of accessible datasets. They specifically mention the **UGRansome dataset** as a publicly accessible resource created for classifying and understanding ransomware. This confirms its significance in the study.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide more details about the **UGRansome dataset**, including its attributes and the types of ransomware it covers. They mention that it includes labeled instances of well-known ransomware variants like Locky, CryptoLocker, and WannaCry, which further emphasizes its relevance.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **UGRansome dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Nkongolo, M., Van Deventer, J. P., & Kasongo, S. M. (2021). Ugransome1819: A novel dataset for anomaly detection and zero-day threats. *Information*, 12(10), 405.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Confirm the dataset's details in the methodology section.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the dataset's significance and provide the necessary citation for future reference.
