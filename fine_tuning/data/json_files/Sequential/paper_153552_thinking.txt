To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Applying Deep Learning to Detect Traffic Accidents in Real Time Using Spatiotemporal Sequential Data" by Amir Bahador Parsa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract states that the study utilizes a dataset consisting of **241 accident cases and 6,038 non-accident cases** from the Chicago expressway. This indicates that there is a primary dataset used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **data description** sections for more details about the dataset. In the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of traffic accident detection and mention the dataset's composition. The **data description** section provides further insights, specifying that the dataset includes traffic spatiotemporal data, weather condition data, and congestion status data collected over a specific period (December 2016 to December 2017).

In the **data description section**, the authors clarify that the dataset consists of **241 accident cases** and **6,038 non-accident cases**, which were randomly selected to represent normal traffic conditions. This section also describes the data collection process and the features included in the dataset, such as traffic volume, occupancy, speed, and weather conditions.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset in the **references section**. However, the dataset itself does not appear to have a dedicated citation in the references. Instead, the authors mention that the accident data is provided by the **Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT)**. Therefore, I will cite this source as the dataset reference.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT). *Accident data for the Chicago metropolitan area, December 2016 - December 2017*.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset description and the citation. The dataset entry will highlight the number of accident and non-accident cases, the types of data included, and the source of the dataset.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the dataset used in the research paper, providing a clear and comprehensive overview.
