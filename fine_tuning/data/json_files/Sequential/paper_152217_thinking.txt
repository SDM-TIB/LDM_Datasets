To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Neural Language Models with a Continuous Cache" by Edouard Grave et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their approach on several language model datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention two small-scale datasets:

1. **Penn Tree Bank**: This dataset is described as containing articles from the Wall Street Journal, with 929k training tokens and a vocabulary size of 10k.

2. **wikitext2**: This dataset is derived from Wikipedia articles, containing 2M training tokens and a vocabulary size of 33k.

The authors also mention two medium-scale datasets in the same section:

3. **text8**: This dataset contains 17M training tokens and has a vocabulary size of 44k words.

4. **wikitext103**: This dataset has a training set size of 103M tokens and a vocabulary size of 267k words.

Additionally, they discuss the **LAMBADA dataset** in section 5.3, which is a dataset of short passages extracted from novels, specifically designed for predicting the last word of an excerpt. It contains approximately 200M tokens and has a vocabulary size of 93,215.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **Penn Tree Bank**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M. P., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., & Santorini, B. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

- For the **wikitext2** dataset, the citation is:

- For the **text8** dataset, the citation is:
  > Mikolov, T., Sutskever, I., Chen, K., Corrado, G. S., & Dean, J. (2013). Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, 26.

- For the **wikitext103** dataset, the citation is:
  > Merity, S., Keskar, N. S., & Socher, R. (2016). Regularizing and Optimizing LSTM Language Models. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.02002*.

- For the **LAMBADA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Paperno, D., Kruszewski, G., Lazaridou, A., Pham, Q. N., Bernardi, R., Pezzelle, S., Baroni, M., Boleda, G., & Fern√°ndez, R. (2016). The LAMBADA dataset: Word prediction requiring a broad discourse context. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.06031*.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
