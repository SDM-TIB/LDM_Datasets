To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Speaker Embedding Learning with Multi-Level Pooling for Text-Independent Speaker Verification" by Yun Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions improvements on the x-vector model and references evaluations on the NIST SRE 2016 eval test and SRE 2018 dev test, indicating that these are likely datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data set)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **NIST SRE 2016 eval test**: This dataset includes Tagalog and Cantonese telephone speech, which is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model.

2. **NIST SRE 2018 dev test**: Specifically, the authors refer to the Call My Net2 (CMN2) portion of the development dataset, which consists of PSTN and VOIP data collected outside North America, spoken in Tunisian Arabic.

Additionally, the authors describe a large training dataset formed from various publicly available sources, including:

- SRE data from years 2004 to 2006, 2008, 2010
- All Switchboard data
- All Fisher data
- All Voxceleb data

This dataset comprises approximately 13,564 hours of audio from a total of 20,803 speakers.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **NIST SRE 2016 eval test** and **NIST SRE 2018 dev test**, the citation is:
  > NIST. "The NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation Series." Available at: https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/speaker-recognition-evaluations.

- For the **SRE data** and other datasets mentioned, the citation is:
  > Snyder, D., Garcia-Romero, D., Sell, G., Povey, D., & Khudanpur, S. (2018). "X-vectors: Robust DNN embeddings for speaker recognition." In ICASSP 2018.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
