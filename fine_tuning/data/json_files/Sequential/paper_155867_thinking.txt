To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention-LSTM for Multivariate Traffic State Prediction on Rural Roads" by Elahe Sherafat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and case study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes traffic data from a rural road segment, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **case study section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe the data used for their analysis. They mention that the data consists of **5-minute traffic volume and average speed** collected from a specific rural road segment in Iran, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

In **Section 4.1**, the authors specify that the data was collected from loop detectors on the Karaj-Chalus rural highway, covering a two-year period from 2018 to 2019. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including the type of data (traffic volume and speed) and the time intervals (5-minute, 15-minute, and 30-minute aggregated data).

The authors also mention that the raw data were obtained from the Road Maintenance and Transportation Organization (RMTO) website, which is a critical piece of information for citation purposes. However, they clarify that the specific 5-minute interval data used in the study is not publicly available, which is important to note.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the RMTO website, which serves as the source for the dataset. The citation is as follows:
> RMTO. Road Maintenance and Transportation Organization (RMTO) website traffic flow data in rural road of Iran. https://141.ir/ (2022). Accessed: 2022-09-04.

Additionally, I will note that the authors reference the loop detectors and the specific road segment, but they do not provide a formal citation for the data collection methods or the detectors themselves. Therefore, I will focus on the RMTO citation as the primary source for the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, ready for further processing or review.
