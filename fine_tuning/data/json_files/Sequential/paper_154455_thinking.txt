To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coreference Resolution: Are the eliminated spans totally worthless?" by Xin Tan, Longyin Zhang, and Guodong Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimentation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on the **document-level CoNLL-2012 Shared Task English dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is relevant to their research.

Next, I will look for more details in the **experimentation section**. Here, the authors provide specific information about the dataset used: they mention that the CoNLL-2012 dataset contains **2802 documents for training, 343 documents for validation, and 348 documents for testing**, covering various genres such as newswire, magazine articles, and conversational speech data. This confirms that the CoNLL-2012 dataset is the primary dataset utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CoNLL-2012 dataset. The relevant citation is:

> Pradhan, S., Moschitti, A., Xue, N., Uryupina, O., Zhang, Y. (2012). *CoNLL-2012 shared task: Modeling multilingual unrestricted coreference in OntoNotes*. In Joint Conference on EMNLP and CoNLL - Shared Task. pp. 1â€“40. Association for Computational Linguistics, Jeju Island, Korea. https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W12-4501

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will prepare to compile this information into the required format for further processing.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Confirm the dataset details in the experimentation section.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the necessary information about the dataset used in the research paper.
