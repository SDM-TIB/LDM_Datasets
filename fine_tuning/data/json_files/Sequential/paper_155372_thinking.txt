To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Precipitation Nowcasting using Deep Neural Network" by Mohamed Chaﬁk Bakkay et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of deep learning models trained on two-dimensional precipitation maps, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. In this section, they mention two types of data collected by METEO FRANCE:

1. **ANTILOPE Dataset**: This dataset includes convective precipitation data recorded every 15 minutes. It is part of the radar echo data used for precipitation nowcasting.

2. **HYDRE Dataset**: This dataset contains temperature profile types and precipitation types, recorded every 5 minutes. It complements the ANTILOPE dataset and is also part of the radar echo data.

The authors specify that the METEO FRANCE dataset covers an area of approximately 1000 × 1000 km², centered in France, and provides additional details about the spatial resolution and the geographical coordinates.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are specific to METEO FRANCE and do not have standard citations like published datasets, I will note that the authors reference the source of the data collection.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant citations or sources.

The final entries for the datasets will be:

- **ANTILOPE Dataset**: Data on convective precipitation recorded every 15 minutes.
- **HYDRE Dataset**: Data on temperature profiles and precipitation types recorded every 5 minutes.

Since these datasets are derived from METEO FRANCE, I will note that the source is METEO FRANCE, France, 2017-2018.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
