To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mogrifier LSTM" by GÃ¡bor Melis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors report results on several datasets, which suggests that I should find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: This dataset is referenced as a word-level language modeling corpus, and the authors note that it has preprocessing from Mikolov et al. (2010).

2. **Wikitext-2**: Another word-level dataset mentioned, which is larger than PTB and has preprocessing from Merity et al. (2016).

3. **Enwik8**: A character-level dataset from the Hutter Prize dataset, where the authors specify that they use the first 90 million characters for training.

4. **Multilingual Wikipedia Corpus (MWC)**: The authors focus on the English and Finnish language subdatasets for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they evaluate their models on these datasets, providing further validation of their use.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M. P., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., & Santorini, B. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

- For the **Wikitext-2**, the citation is:
  > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2016). Pointer sentinel mixture models. *CoRR*, abs/1609.07843.

- For **Enwik8**, the citation is:
  > Hutter, M. (2012). The human knowledge compression contest. URL http://prize.hutter1.net.

- For the **Multilingual Wikipedia Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Kawakami, K., Dyer, C., & Blunsom, P. (2017). Learning to create and reuse words in open-vocabulary neural language modeling. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.06986*.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
