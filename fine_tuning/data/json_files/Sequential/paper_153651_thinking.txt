To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Emotion Primitives from Speech and Their Use in Discerning Categorical Emotions" by V. Kowtha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of multiple datasets for training models to detect emotion primitives, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Spontaneous Speech Corpus**: This dataset contains 120 hours of speech material spoken in US English, with perceptually assigned valence, arousal, and dominance scores. The authors reference an earlier study for more information, which is crucial for citation purposes.

2. **MSP-Podcast Dataset**: This dataset includes speech from English speakers collected from online audio shows, totaling over 50 hours of speech. The authors provide details about the structure of the dataset, including speaker and gender labels.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Spontaneous Speech Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Vikramjit Mitra, Sue Booker, Erik Marchi, David Farrar, Ute Peitz, Bridget Cheng, Ermine Teves, Anuj Mehta, and Devang Naik. *Leveraging acoustic cues and paralinguistic embeddings to detect expression from voice*. Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, INTERSPEECH, 06 2019.

- For the **MSP-Podcast Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Soroosh Mariooryad, R. Lotfian, and Carlos Busso. *Building a naturalistic emotional speech corpus by retrieving expressive behaviors from existing speech corpora*. Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, INTERSPEECH, pp. 238â€“242, 01 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective references.
