To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An AutoML-based Approach to Multimodal Image Sentiment Analysis" by Vasco Lopes et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the method achieved state-of-the-art performance on the **B-T4SA dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors introduce the datasets used. Here, they provide a detailed description of three datasets:

1. **B-T4SA**: This dataset is a subset of T4SA, consisting of 470,000 samples, each containing both text and image information. The authors mention that all classes are balanced, and the dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-5)**: This dataset consists of sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences. It can be used for binary or fine-grained classification and is utilized for initial training before fine-tuning on the B-T4SA dataset.

3. **Flickr and Instagram Dataset**: This dataset contains 23,308 labeled images across 8 different classes of emotions. It is used for transfer learning in the image classification component.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **B-T4SA**, the citation is:

- For **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-5)**, the citation is:

- For **Flickr and Instagram Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective references.
