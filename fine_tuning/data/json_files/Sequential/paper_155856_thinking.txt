To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer in Transformer as Backbone for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Hangyu Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior works that may include datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly any subsections that discuss datasets or evaluation metrics. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets in the context of reinforcement learning tasks. The authors may refer to standard benchmarks or datasets commonly used in the field, such as those from OpenAI Gym or D4RL.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention using the **D4RL datasets**, I will find the citation for the original paper that introduced these datasets. Similarly, if they reference specific environments from OpenAI Gym, I will look for the appropriate citation for that as well.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names along with their full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive list of datasets used in the research, complete with proper references for each.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, making it easy to understand which datasets were used and how they are cited in the context of the research paper.
