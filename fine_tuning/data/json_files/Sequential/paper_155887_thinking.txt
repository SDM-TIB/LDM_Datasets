To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-Resource Compositional Semantic Parsing with Concept Pretraining" by Subendhu Rongali et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of the **TOPv2 dataset** and **SNIPS dataset** for evaluating the proposed model, indicating that these are key datasets to extract.

Next, I will delve into the **experiments section** where the authors discuss their evaluation methodology. Here, they explicitly mention using the **TOPv2 dataset** and **SNIPS dataset** for both few-shot and zero-shot settings. This confirms their significance in the research.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors provide details about the datasets:
- **TOPv2 Dataset**: This dataset is described as having utterances grouped into multiple domains, with a total of 10k-20k training and 3k-7k test examples per domain.
- **SNIPS Dataset**: This dataset is noted for its simpler structure, containing 2k training and 100 test examples per domain.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

The citations I will extract are:
- For the **TOPv2 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xilun Chen, Asish Ghoshal, Yashar Mehdad, Luke Zettlemoyer, and Sonal Gupta. *Low-resource domain adaptation for compositional task-oriented semantic parsing*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.03546, 2020.

- For the **SNIPS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alice Coucke, Alaa Saade, Adrien Ball, Théodore Bluche, Alexandre Caulier, David Leroy, Clément Doumouro, Thibault Gisselbrecht, Francesco Caltagirone, Thibaut Lavril, et al. *Snips voice platform: an embedded spoken language understanding system for private-by-design voice interfaces*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.10190, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
