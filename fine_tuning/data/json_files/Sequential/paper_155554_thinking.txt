To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Optimal Solutions via an LSTM-Optimization Framework" by Dogacan Yilmaz and I. Esra Büyüktah takın, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data generation methods.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors may discuss the significance of the datasets used in their experiments. I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets that are relevant to the capacitated lot-sizing problem (CLSP) and the LSTM-Optimization framework.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the part discussing the **CLSP instance generation**, the authors detail how they generated datasets for training, validation, and testing. They mention generating 1,200,000 instances based on various parameters, which indicates that these instances form the core datasets used in their experiments. I will note the specific characteristics of these datasets, such as the number of instances, parameters used, and any relevant statistics.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors refer to any specific datasets when discussing their computational results. This may provide additional context or validation for the datasets mentioned earlier.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

The datasets I will focus on include:

1. **CLSP Instances**: The authors generated 1,200,000 instances for the capacitated lot-sizing problem based on various parameters (capacity-to-demand ratios, setup-to-holding cost ratios, and number of periods). The specific details of these instances will be noted.

2. **Training, Validation, and Test Sets**: The paper mentions that the datasets are divided into training (64%), validation (16%), and test sets (20%). I will ensure to capture these proportions and any specific characteristics mentioned.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes a full citation for any referenced methodologies or datasets, as this is essential for academic integrity and reproducibility.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining proper citation practices.
