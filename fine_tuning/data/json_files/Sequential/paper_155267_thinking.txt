To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Underwater Acoustic Communication Channel Modeling using Deep Learning" by Oluwaseyi Onasami et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data generation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used real underwater data collected from a water tank and from Lake Tahoe, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data Generation and Description)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. They mention three datasets:

1. **Data 1**: This dataset was obtained from a developed test bed in a water tank with no disturbance. It consists of 60 seconds of continuous signals captured at a sample rate of 1,000,000 Hz. The details about the data generation process are provided, indicating that it is a controlled dataset.

2. **Data 2**: This dataset was collected from Lake Tahoe, also with no artificial disturbance. It follows the same signal processing stages as Data 1, ensuring consistency in the experimental setup.

3. **Data 3**: This dataset was collected using the same setup as Data 2 but with disturbances introduced to create a mild chaotic scenario. The authors note that 60,000,000 samples were collected for all three datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are based on the authors' own data collection efforts. Instead, I will note that the datasets are derived from real-world experiments conducted by the authors.

To summarize, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

- **Data 1**: Collected from a water tank with no disturbance.
- **Data 2**: Collected from Lake Tahoe with no disturbance.
- **Data 3**: Collected from Lake Tahoe with disturbances.

Since the datasets are original and do not have external citations, I will document them as follows:

1. **Data 1**: Original dataset collected by the authors from a water tank.
2. **Data 2**: Original dataset collected by the authors from Lake Tahoe.
3. **Data 3**: Original dataset collected by the authors from Lake Tahoe with disturbances.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
