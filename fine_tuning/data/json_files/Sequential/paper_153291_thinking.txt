To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inception-inspired LSTM for Next-frame Video Prediction" by Matin Hosseini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on the **KITTI** and **KTH datasets**, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental setup and results)**, where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They mention that the **KITTI dataset** is a traffic dataset captured with a car-mounted camera, and the **KTH dataset** contains human activity videos. This confirms that both datasets are indeed used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
   > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Charles Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 32(11):1231â€“1237, 2013.

2. For the **KTH dataset**, the citation is:
   > C. Schuldt, I. Laptev, and B. Caputo. *Recognizing human actions: a local SVM approach*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR), Cambridge, U.K, 2004.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
