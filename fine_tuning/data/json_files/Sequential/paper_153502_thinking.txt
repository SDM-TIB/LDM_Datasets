To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PQ-NET: A Generative Part Seq2Seq Network for 3D Shapes" by Rundi Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors utilize segmented 3D shapes from PartNet, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts where the authors describe their training data. In the text, they state that they use segmented 3D shapes from **PartNet**, which is built on **ShapeNet**. This suggests that both datasets are relevant for the research.

I will then look for specific details about these datasets in the **results and evaluation sections**. The authors mention that they primarily use the three largest categories from PartNet: chairs, tables, and lamps. They provide statistics about the number of shapes in each category, which further confirms the importance of PartNet in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For **PartNet**, the citation is:
   > Mo, K., Zhu, S., Chang, A. X., Yi, L., Tripathi, S., Guibas, L. J., & Su, H. (2019). PartNet: A large-scale benchmark for fine-grained and hierarchical part-level 3D object understanding. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

2. For **ShapeNet**, the citation is:
   > Chang, A. X., Funkhouser, T., Guibas, L. J., Hanrahan, P., Huang, Q., Li, Z., Savarese, S., Savva, M., Song, H., Su, H., Xiao, J., Yi, L., & Yu, F. (2015). ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository. arXiv:1512.03012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration or replication of the study.
