To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Robust Car Following Dynamics Modeling via Blackbox Models: Methodology, Analysis, and Recommendations" by Muhammad Bilal Shahid and Cody Fleming, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **results section**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used in their experiments: **ASTAZERO**, **JIANG**, and **NAPOLI**. I will take note of the descriptions provided for each dataset, as they will help in understanding the context in which these datasets were used.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **ASTAZERO**: The dataset is described as being collected via automated vehicles driving in a platoon in Sweden. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Michail Makridis, Konstantinos Mattas, Aikaterini Anesiadou, and Biagio Ciuffo. *OpenACC: An Open Database of Car-Following Experiments to Study the Properties of Commercial ACC Systems*. Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 125:103047, 2021.

2. **JIANG**: This dataset consists of trajectories from human-driven vehicles collected in Hefei City. The citation is:
   > Rui Jiang, Mao-Bin Hu, HM Zhang, Zi-You Gao, Bin Jia, and Qing-Song Wu. *On Some Experimental Features of Car-Following Behavior and How to Model Them*. Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 80:338–354, 2015.

3. **NAPOLI**: This dataset was collected from human-driven vehicles in the city of Naples. The citation is:
   > Vincenzo Punzo and Fulvio Simonelli. *Analysis and Comparison of Microscopic Traffic Flow Models with Real Traffic Microscopic Data*. Transportation Research Record, 1934(1):53–63, 2005.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and provide a clear reference for anyone interested in the datasets used in this study.
