To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-modal Map Learning for Vision and Language Navigation" by Georgios Georgakis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method on the **VLN-CE benchmark**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on the **VLN-CE dataset**, which consists of 16,844 path-instruction pairs over 90 scenes in the Matterport3D environment. This is a significant dataset for their research.

I will also check the **related work section** and **conclusion** to see if any other datasets are referenced or if there are any additional insights into the datasets used. However, the primary dataset mentioned throughout the paper appears to be the VLN-CE dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the VLN-CE dataset. The citation for the VLN-CE dataset is as follows:
> Krantz, J., Wijmans, E., Majumdar, A., Batra, D., & Lee, S. (2020). Beyond the nav-graph: Vision-and-language navigation in continuous environments. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

Additionally, the authors mention using the **Matterport3D dataset** as part of their experiments. I will also find its citation:
> Chang, A., Dai, A., Funkhouser, T., Halber, M., Niessner, M., Savva, M., Song, S., Zeng, A., & Zhang, Y. (2017). Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D data in indoor environments. In International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV).

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **VLN-CE Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 16,844 path-instruction pairs over 90 scenes in the Matterport3D environment.
   - Citation: Krantz, J., Wijmans, E., Majumdar, A., Batra, D., & Lee, S. (2020). Beyond the nav-graph: Vision-and-language navigation in continuous environments. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

2. **Matterport3D Dataset**: A dataset used for training and testing in indoor environments.
   - Citation: Chang, A., Dai, A., Funkhouser, T., Halber, M., Niessner, M., Savva, M., Song, S., Zeng, A., & Zhang, Y. (2017). Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D data in indoor environments. In International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
