To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UVid-Net: Enhanced Semantic Segmentation of UAV Aerial Videos by Embedding Temporal Information" by Girisha S et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on an extended version of the **ManipalUAVid dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look specifically in **section IV (Results and Discussion)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention the **ManipalUAVid dataset** in detail, describing its characteristics, such as the number of videos, keyframes, and the pixel-level annotations provided for various classes (greenery, construction, road, and water bodies). This section confirms that the **ManipalUAVid dataset** is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

The paper also references the original **ManipalUAVid dataset** in the context of its extension. The authors state that the extended dataset consists of 37 videos with annotations for 711 keyframes, which is essential information for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the original **ManipalUAVid dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:
> S Girisha, Manohara MM Pai, Ujjwal Verma, and Radhika M Pai. *Performance analysis of semantic segmentation algorithms for finely annotated new UAV aerial video dataset (ManipalUAVid)*. IEEE Access, 7:136239â€“136253, 2019.

Since the extended dataset is based on the original, I will use this citation for the **ManipalUAVid dataset**.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the **ManipalUAVid dataset** as it is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent use of the dataset.

In summary, the key steps I followed are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Examine the results section for detailed information about the dataset.
3. Locate the full citation in the references for proper attribution.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **ManipalUAVid dataset** with the full citation included.
