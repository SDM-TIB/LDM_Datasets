To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-layer Space Information Networks: Access Design and Softwarization" by Hayder Al-Hraishawi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or case studies** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper for specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction and subsequent sections** to see if the authors mention any datasets used for their analysis or simulations. I will pay particular attention to sections that discuss methodologies, experiments, or case studies, as these are likely to contain references to datasets.

As I read through the paper, I will look for any **tables, figures, or references** that might indicate the presence of datasets. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data collected, and the context in which they were used.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced correctly in future work.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "UCS satellite database," I will look for the full citation in the references. If it is not explicitly cited, I will note that it is a publicly available dataset and provide the URL or source if available.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will create a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and concise, making it easy for others to understand the relevance and context of each dataset in relation to the research presented in the paper.
