To extract datasets from the research paper titled "(Un)solving Morphological Inflection: Lemma Overlap Artificially Inflates Models’ Performance" by Omer Goldman, David Guriel, and Reut Tsarfaty, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of morphological inflection models and hints at the use of datasets from SIGMORPHON's shared tasks, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that describe the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention the use of the **UniMorph dataset** in the introduction, which is a key dataset for morphological inflection tasks. 

In the **experiments section**, I will check for any additional details about the datasets, such as how they were split or any modifications made for the experiments. The authors propose a new splitting method for the SIGMORPHON 2020 shared-task data, which indicates that they are working with this dataset as well.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **UniMorph Dataset**: The citation for the UniMorph dataset is:
   > Arya D. McCarthy, Ekaterina Vylomova, Shijie Wu, Chaitanya Malaviya, Lawrence Wolf-Sonkin, Garrett Nicolai, Christo Kirov, Miikka Silfverberg, Sabrina J. Mielke, Jeffrey Heinz, Ryan Cotterell, and Mans Hulden. *UniMorph 3.0: Universal Morphology*. In Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 3922–3931, Marseille, France. European Language Resources Association, 2020.

2. **SIGMORPHON 2020 Shared Task Data**: The citation for the SIGMORPHON 2020 shared task data is:
   > Ekaterina Vylomova, Jennifer White, Elizabeth Salesky, Sabrina J. Mielke, Shijie Wu, Edoardo Maria Ponti, Rowan Hall Maudslay, Ran Zmigrod, Josef Valvoda, Svetlana Toldova, Francis Tyers, Elena Klyachko, Ilya Yegorov, Natalia Krizhanovsky, Paula Czarnowska, Irene Nikkarinen, Andrew Krizhanovsky, Tiago Pimentel, Lucas Torroba Hennigen, Christo Kirov, Garrett Nicolai, Adina Williams, Antonios Anastasopoulos, Hilaria Cruz, Eleanor Chodroff, Ryan Cotterell, Miikka Silfverberg, and Mans Hulden. *SIGMORPHON 2020 shared task 0: Typologically diverse morphological inflection*. In Proceedings of the 17th SIGMORPHON Workshop on Computational Research in Phonetics, Phonology, and Morphology, pages 1–39, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the experiments conducted.
