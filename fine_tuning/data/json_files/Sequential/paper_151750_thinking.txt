To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long short-term memory and learning to learn in networks of spiking neurons" by Guillaume Bellec et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in detail, particularly in sections that discuss the tasks they evaluated their models on. I will look for specific mentions of datasets used for training and testing their models.

From my reading, I identify two main datasets mentioned in the experiments:

1. **Sequential MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is used for a benchmark task where the model classifies handwritten digits presented sequentially. The authors mention that they achieved classification accuracies of 94.7% and 96.4% for different input presentation times.

2. **TIMIT Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for a speech recognition task, where the authors report a classification error of 33.2% on phoneme classification. They follow the conventions set by Halberstadt for grouping training, validation, and testing sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **TIMIT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Glass, A. Smith, and A. K. Halberstadt. *Heterogeneous Acoustic Measurements and Multiple Classifiers for Speech Recognition*. 1999.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will be done in a structured format that highlights the dataset name, description, and full citation for clarity and completeness.
