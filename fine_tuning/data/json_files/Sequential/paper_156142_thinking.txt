To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probing the limit of hydrologic predictability with the Transformer network" by Jiangtao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study evaluates the performance of the Transformer architecture on the **CAMELS dataset**, which is a significant clue that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine the **results and discussion** sections, as they often provide detailed insights into the datasets used for experiments. In this case, the authors explicitly mention using the **CAMELS dataset** for their analysis of rainfall-runoff modeling. They also reference the **NLDAS** (North American Land Data Assimilation System) dataset in the context of their experiments, particularly when discussing the performance metrics of the models.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. The paper discusses the use of multiple forcing datasets, including NLDAS, which is crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **bibliography** or **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **CAMELS dataset**, the citation is:
> Addor, N., Newman, A. J., Mizukami, N., & Clark, M. P. (2017). Catchment attributes for large-sample studies [Data set]. UCAR/NCAR. https://doi.org/10.5065/D6G73C3Q

For the **NLDAS dataset**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, I can refer to the original source of the NLDAS data:
> Xia, Y., Mitchell, K. E., Ek, M. B., & Cosgrove, B. A. (2012). Continental-scale water and energy flux analysis using NLDAS data. *Journal of Hydrometeorology*, 13(1), 1-20. https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-11-010.1

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify datasets.
2. Examine the results and discussion for detailed mentions of datasets.
3. Check the references for full citations of the datasets.
4. Compile the dataset information for structured output.
