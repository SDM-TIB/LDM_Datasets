To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Effective Baseline for Robustness to Distributional Shift" by Sunil Thulasidasan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets employed in the study.

In the **experiments section (3.1 Datasets)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **Tiny ImageNet**: A subset of ImageNet with 200 classes, each containing 500 training images.
4. **SVHN**: A dataset of house numbers from real-world images, consisting of 32x32 color images.
5. **LSUN**: A large-scale dataset for scene understanding, containing images from 10 different scene categories.
6. **Places365**: A dataset with images of scenes categorized into 365 classes.
7. **Gaussian**: A synthetic dataset consisting of random Gaussian noise images.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- **CIFAR-10**:

- **CIFAR-100**:

- **Gaussian**: 
  > This dataset is synthetic and does not have a formal citation, but it is commonly referenced in the context of out-of-distribution detection.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use.
