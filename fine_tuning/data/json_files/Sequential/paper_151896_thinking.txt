To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Effective Quantization Approaches for Recurrent Neural Networks" by Md Zahangir Alom et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their quantization methods on datasets for sentiment analysis and video frame predictions. This suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Results and Discussion)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis. The authors mention that they used it with a maximum feature number of 20,000 and a maximum number of words set to 80.

2. **Moving MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for video frame prediction tasks. The authors state that they tested their quantization methods on this dataset, which consists of sequences of moving digits.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. "Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis." In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2011).

- For the **Moving MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Srivastava, Nitish, Elman Mansimov, and Ruslan Salakhudinov. "Unsupervised Learning of Video Representations using LSTMs." In International Conference on Machine Learning, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have a clear and accurate representation of the datasets used in the research.
