To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sketch Less Face Image Retrieval: A New Challenge" by Dawei Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new task called sketch less face image retrieval (SLFIR) and hints at the development of datasets for this task. This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of sketch-based image retrieval and the challenges associated with it. They mention the need for datasets that include face photos and their corresponding sketch drawing processes, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed in the methodology or experiments sections.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled "Generating the sketch drawing episode." Here, the authors describe their method for generating datasets based on complete sketches. They mention that they opened two datasets, D1 and D2, which are derived from the FS2K dataset. This is a crucial point as it indicates the datasets used for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about D1 and D2:
- **D1**: Contains 107,030 sketches and 1,529 photos, with specific splits for training and testing.
- **D2**: Contains 33,390 sketches and 477 photos, also with training and testing splits.

The authors also mention that they generated these datasets from the original FS2K dataset, which contains complete face sketches. This is important for citing the original source of the datasets.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The FS2K dataset is referenced as follows:
- For **FS2K**: 
  > Fan DP, Huang Z, Zheng P, et al. *Deep Facial Synthesis: A New Challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.15439, 2021.

Since D1 and D2 are derived from FS2K, I will cite FS2K as the authoritative source for these datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. The datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **D1**: Derived from FS2K, containing 107,030 sketches and 1,529 photos.
2. **D2**: Derived from FS2K, containing 33,390 sketches and 477 photos.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing.
