To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NAS-FPN: Learning Scalable Feature Pyramid Architecture for Object Detection" by Golnaz Ghaisi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the performance of the NAS-FPN architecture but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of various backbone models and refer to the RetinaNet framework, but again, no specific datasets are named. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are likely to be detailed.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their implementation details and mention that they trained their models on the **COCO train2017** dataset and evaluated on the **COCO val2017** dataset. This is a clear indication that these datasets are used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The COCO dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of object detection, and its citation is as follows:

- For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Sergio F. G. Vasquez, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. 

This process ensures that I have accurately extracted the relevant datasets from the paper while providing the necessary citations for each dataset used in the research.
