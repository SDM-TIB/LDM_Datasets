To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expect the unexpected: Harnessing Sentence Completion for Sarcasm Detection" by Aditya Joshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using two datasets: one for tweets and another for discussion forum posts. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will look into **section V (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe:

1. **Tweets Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,278 total tweets, with 506 labeled as sarcastic. The dataset is manually annotated and is referenced as being from Riloff et al. (2013).

2. **Discussion Forum Posts Dataset**: This dataset includes 752 sarcastic posts and 752 non-sarcastic posts, also manually annotated. The authors reference this dataset as being from Walker et al. (2012).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Tweets Dataset** (Riloff et al., 2013), the citation is:
  > E. Riloff, A. Qadir, P. Surve, L. De Silva, N. Gilbert, and R. Huang. *Sarcasm as contrast between a positive sentiment and negative situation*. In EMNLP, 2013, pp. 704–714.

- For the **Discussion Forum Posts Dataset** (Walker et al., 2012), the citation is:
  > M. A. Walker, J. E. F. Tree, P. Anand, R. Abbott, and J. King. *A corpus for research on deliberation and debate*. In LREC, 2012, pp. 812–817.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include the full citations as required. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
