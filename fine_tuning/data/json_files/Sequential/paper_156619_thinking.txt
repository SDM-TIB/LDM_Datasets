To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "ÚFAL LatinPipe at EvaLatin 2024: Morphosyntactic Analysis of Latin" by Milan Straka et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the system is trained using seven publicly available Latin corpora, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors list the seven Latin corpora used for training the LatinPipe system. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **ITTB of UD 2.13**: This dataset is referenced as being from the Universal Dependencies project and is attributed to Passarotti (2019).
2. **LLCT of UD 2.13**: This dataset is attributed to Cecchini et al. (2020a).
3. **PROIEL**: The authors mention two versions of this dataset, one from Haug and Jøhndal (2008) and a harmonized version by Gamba and Zeman (2023a,b).
4. **UDante of UD 2.13**: This dataset is attributed to Cecchini et al. (2020b).
5. **Perseus of UD 2.13**: This dataset is attributed to Bamman and Crane (2011).
6. **De Latinae Linguae Reparatione**: This dataset is attributed to Gamba and Cecchini (2024).
7. **Archimedes Latinus**: This dataset is attributed to Fantoli and de Lhoneux (2022).

I will then verify the citations for each dataset by consulting the **References section** of the paper to ensure I have the correct and complete citations.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
