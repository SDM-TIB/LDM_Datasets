To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NAS-BENCH-1SHOT1: Benchmarking and Dissecting One-Shot Neural Architecture Search" by Arber Zela et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the introduction of **NAS-Bench-1Shot1**, which is a benchmarking framework for one-shot NAS methods. This indicates that the paper is centered around a specific dataset or benchmark.

Next, I will look for sections that specifically discuss datasets, such as **section 2 (Background and Related Work)** and **section 5 (NAS-Bench-1Shot1 as a Benchmark and Analysis Framework)**. In these sections, the authors describe **NAS-Bench-101** and **NAS-Bench-102**, which are crucial datasets for their experiments.

1. **NAS-Bench-101**: This dataset is described as a comprehensive database of an exhaustive evaluation of all architectures in a constrained cell-structured space on CIFAR-10. It contains 423k unique cell architectures, each trained and fully evaluated, allowing for cheap simulations of NAS methods.

   The citation for NAS-Bench-101 is:
   > Ying, C., Klein, A., Christiansen, E., Real, E., Murphy, K., & Hutter, F. (2019). *NAS-Bench-101: Towards Reproducible Neural Architecture Search*. In Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2019.

2. **NAS-Bench-102**: This dataset is mentioned as another NAS benchmark that enables the evaluation of weight-sharing NAS methods, consisting of 15,625 architectures evaluated on three image classification datasets.

   The citation for NAS-Bench-102 is:
   > Dong, X., & Yang, Y. (2020). *NAS-Bench-102: Extending the Scope of Reproducible Neural Architecture Search*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2020.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their significance in the context of the paper and how they contribute to the research findings.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and can be easily accessed later.
