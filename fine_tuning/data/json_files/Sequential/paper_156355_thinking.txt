To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A New Time Series Similarity Measure and Its Smart Grid Applications" by Rui Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed distance measure using real-world data in three smart grid applications, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their simulation studies. In the **Load Scheduling** subsection, they mention using data from the **SolarHome dataset**. I will look for details about this dataset, including its origin and any specific characteristics mentioned.

In the **Anomaly Detection** subsection, the authors refer to using unidentified residential consumer data from Adelaide, Australia. I will note this dataset as well, ensuring to capture its context and any relevant details provided.

In the **BTM Equipment Identification** subsection, the authors mention using a state-of-the-art dataset comprising 60,000 daily electricity usage patterns from six distinct types of residential users. I will extract this information as it represents another dataset used in their analysis.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. For the **SolarHome dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ausgrid. (2015). *Solar home electricity data*. Available: https://www.ausgrid.com.au/Industry/Our-Research/Data-to-share/Solar-home-electricity-data

2. For the **unidentified residential consumer data**, there is no specific citation provided in the paper, but I will note it as a dataset used in the study.

3. For the **state-of-the-art dataset** comprising 60,000 daily electricity usage patterns, the citation is:
   > Yuan, R., Pourmousavi, S. A., Soong, W. L., Black, A. J., Liisberg, J. A. R., & Lemos-Vinasco, J. (2023). *A synthetic dataset of Danish residential electricity prosumers*. Scientific Data, pp. 1â€“15.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
