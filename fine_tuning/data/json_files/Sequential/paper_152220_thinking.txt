To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empirical Evaluation of A New Approach to Simplifying Long Short-term Memory (LSTM)" by Yuzhen Lu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper evaluates the performance of simplified LSTM variants on two sequence datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimentation section** (Section III), where the author explicitly mentions the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the author states that the effectiveness of the proposed LSTM variants was evaluated using two public datasets: **MNIST** and **IMDB**.

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The paper describes the MNIST dataset as containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9), with each image sized at 28x28 pixels. This dataset is widely used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

2. **IMDB Dataset**: The IMDB dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative, with both training and test sets containing 25,000 reviews each. The reviews are encoded as sequences of word indices based on frequency.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **IMDB dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142-150, 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear and organized presentation of the datasets used in the research paper.
