To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UniformAugment: A Search-free Probabilistic Data Augmentation Approach" by Tom Ching Ling Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors use "standard datasets" for their experiments, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper. I will look for any explicit names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets and their characteristics. The authors mention using **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **ImageNet** datasets for their experiments, which are critical to note.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech. rep., University of Toronto.

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech. rep., University of Toronto.

3. **ImageNet**:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L., Li, K., & Li, F. (2009). *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) (pp. 248â€“255).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, adhering to the importance of proper citation.
