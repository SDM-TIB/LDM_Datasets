To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KeepAugment: A Simple Information-Preserving Data Augmentation Approach" by Chengyue Gong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the empirical evaluation of their method on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention applying their method to improve existing data augmentation techniques on several datasets, including:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **ImageNet**: Specifically, the ILSVRC2012 subset, which consists of approximately 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 classes.
3. **Market1501**: A dataset for person re-identification, containing 32,668 bounding boxes of 1,501 identities.
4. **COCO 2017**: A large-scale dataset for object detection, consisting of 118,000 training images and 5,000 validation images.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and should be formatted correctly.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248–255, 2009.

- For **Market1501**:
  > Liang Zheng, Liyue Shen, Lu Tian, Shengjin Wang, Jingdong Wang, and Qi Tian. *Scalable Person Re-Identification: A Benchmark*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1116–1124, 2015.

- For **COCO 2017**:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollar, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for any further processing or review.
