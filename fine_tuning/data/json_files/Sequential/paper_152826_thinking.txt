To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid LSTM and Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Detection of Image Forgeries" by Jawadul H. Bappy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention a "large image splicing dataset" that is introduced to guide the training process. This indicates that a new dataset is being presented, which I need to document.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. The **experiments section** (specifically section 4.1) is likely to contain information about the datasets utilized for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **NIST’16 Dataset**: This dataset is described as a challenging dataset that includes three main types of manipulation: copy-clone, removal, and splicing. The authors refer to it as a significant dataset for their experiments.

2. **IEEE Forensics Challenge Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as providing ground-truth masks for manipulation, indicating its relevance for training and testing their model.

3. **COVERAGE Dataset**: This dataset is included to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model on copy-move manipulation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **NIST’16 Dataset**:
  > NIST Nimble 2016 Datasets. https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2016/11/30/should_i_believe_or_not.pdf.

- For the **IEEE Forensics Challenge Dataset**:
  > IEEE IFS-TC Image Forensics Challenge Dataset. http://ifc.recod.ic.unicamp.br/fc.website/index.py.

- For the **COVERAGE Dataset**:
  > Wen, B., Zhu, Y., Subramanian, R., Ng, T.-T., Shen, X., & Winkler, S. (2016). Coverage - a novel database for copy-move forgery detection. In IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
