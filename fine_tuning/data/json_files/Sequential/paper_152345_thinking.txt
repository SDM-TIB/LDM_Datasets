To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Semantic Object Parsing with Graph LSTM" by Xiaodan Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted comprehensive evaluations on four diverse semantic object parsing datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention four datasets:

1. **PASCAL-Person-Part dataset**: This dataset is described as containing detailed part annotations for every person, with a total of 1,716 images for training and 1,817 for testing.

2. **Horse-Cow parsing dataset**: This dataset is noted for part segmentation and includes 294 training images and 227 testing images.

3. **ATR dataset**: The authors state that this dataset originally contains 7,700 images, with 6,000 for training, 1,000 for testing, and 700 for validation.

4. **Fashionista dataset**: This dataset consists of 685 images, with 229 images used for testing and the remainder for training.

To ensure accuracy, I will also check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **PASCAL-Person-Part dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, L.C., Papandreou, G., Kokkinos, I., Murphy, K., Yuille, A.L. "Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Nets and Fully Connected CRFs." In ICLR, 2015.

- For the **Horse-Cow parsing dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, J., Yuille, A. "Semantic part segmentation using compositional model combining shape and appearance." In CVPR, 2015.

- For the **ATR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liang, X., Liu, S., Shen, X., Yang, J., Liu, L., Dong, J., Lin, L., Yan, S. "Deep human parsing with active template regression." TPAMI, 2015.

- For the **Fashionista dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yamaguchi, K., Kiapour, M., Ortiz, L., Berg, T. "Parsing clothing in fashion photographs." In CVPR, 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
