To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Graph Neural Networks for Improved Electroencephalographic Seizure Analysis" by Siyi Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their approach on a "large public dataset (5,499 EEGs)," which suggests that a specific dataset is being referenced.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. They state that they utilized the **Temple University Hospital EEG Seizure Corpus (TUSZ) v1.5.2**, which is described as the largest public EEG seizure database with 5,612 EEGs and 3,050 annotated seizures.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the TUSZ dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Vinit Shah, Eva von Weltin, Silvia Lopez, James Riley McHugh, Lillian Veloso, Meysam Golmohammadi, Iyad Obeid, and Joseph Picone. *The Temple University Hospital EEG Seizure Detection Corpus*. Frontiers in Neuroinformatics, 12:83, 2018. doi: 10.3389/fninf.2018.00083.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Temple University Hospital EEG Seizure Corpus (TUSZ)**: This dataset contains 5,612 EEG recordings, with 3,050 annotated seizures across eight seizure types. It is designed for research in automated seizure detection and classification.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
