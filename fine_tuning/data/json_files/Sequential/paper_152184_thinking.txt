To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Map: Structured Memory for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Emilio Parisotto and Ruslan Salakhutdinov, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a memory system for deep reinforcement learning agents, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific environments or datasets that the Neural Map architecture was tested on.

In **section 4.1 (2D Goal-Search Environment)**, the authors describe a specific environment used for testing. They mention that the mazes are generated using a random generator and that a held-out set of 1000 random mazes is kept for testing. However, they do not provide a formal dataset citation here.

In **section 4.2 (3D Doom Environment)**, the authors mention using the ViZDoom environment, which is a platform for visual reinforcement learning. This is a specific dataset/environment that I need to note.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **ViZDoom environment**, the citation is:
   > Michał Kempka, Marek Wydmuch, Grzegorz Runc, Jakub Toczek, and Wojciech Jaśkowski. *ViZDoom: A Doom-based AI research platform for visual reinforcement learning*. In IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games, pp. 341–348, Santorini, Greece, Sep 2016.

The paper does not provide a formal dataset citation for the random maze generation used in the 2D Goal-Search environment, as it appears to be a custom setup without a specific reference.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered. The ViZDoom environment will be included with its citation, while the 2D Goal-Search environment will be noted as a custom dataset without a formal citation.

After this, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that the citations are correctly formatted and attributed.
