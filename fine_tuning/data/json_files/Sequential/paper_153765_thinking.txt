To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Difference Attention Based Error Correction LSTM Model for Time Series Prediction" by Yuxuan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on various time series, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors state that they demonstrate their method on **three temperature telemetry datasets for the space payload**. This is a clear indication that datasets are being used, but I need to identify their specific names and details.

I will look for any tables or figures that might provide more information about these datasets. In this case, the authors do not provide specific names for the datasets in the text, but they do refer to them as "Dataset 1," "Dataset 2," and "Dataset 3" in Table 1. This is not sufficient for citation purposes, so I will need to check the **References section** for any related works that might describe these datasets.

Since the datasets are not explicitly named in the paper, I will note that the authors do not provide full citations for these datasets. However, I will still document the datasets as they are referred to in the paper, along with the context in which they are used.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Dataset 1**: Temperature telemetry dataset for space payload (specific details and citation not provided).
2. **Dataset 2**: Temperature telemetry dataset for space payload (specific details and citation not provided).
3. **Dataset 3**: Temperature telemetry dataset for space payload (specific details and citation not provided).

Since the paper does not provide full citations for these datasets, I will note that in my final output. I will also mention that further investigation may be needed to find authoritative sources or original papers that describe these datasets in detail.

Finally, I will summarize my findings and prepare to present them in a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the lack of specific dataset citations while documenting the context in which they were mentioned in the paper.
