To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VMRNN: Integrating Vision Mamba and LSTM for Efficient and Accurate Spatiotemporal Forecasting" by Yujin Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the evaluation of the proposed method on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, the authors mention three datasets: **Moving MNIST**, **KTH**, and **TaxiBJ**. I will extract the relevant details for each dataset:

1. **Moving MNIST**: The paper describes it as a benchmark synthetic dataset for evaluating sequence prediction models, where each sequence comprises 20 frames. The authors follow the methodology from a previous work for generating sequences.

2. **KTH**: This dataset contains videos of 25 individuals performing six types of human actions. The authors specify how they split the dataset for training and validation.

3. **TaxiBJ**: This dataset includes GPS and meteorological data from taxis in Beijing, represented as a heatmap. The authors detail how they use the data for training and testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Moving MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Nitish Srivastava, Elman Mansimov, and Ruslan Salakhudinov. *Unsupervised learning of video representations using lstms*. In International conference on machine learning, pages 843–852. PMLR, 2015.

- For **KTH**, the citation is:
  > Christian Schuldt, Ivan Laptev, and Barbara Caputo. *Recognizing human actions: a local svm approach*. In Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Pattern Recognition, 2004. ICPR 2004., volume 3, pages 32–36. IEEE, 2004.

- For **TaxiBJ**, the citation is:
  > Junbo Zhang, Yu Zheng, and Dekang Qi. *Deep spatio-temporal residual networks for citywide crowd flows prediction*. In Thirty-first AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, 2017.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
