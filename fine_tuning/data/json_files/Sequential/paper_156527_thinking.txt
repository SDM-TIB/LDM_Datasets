To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RSCNet: Dynamic CSI Compression for Cloud-based WiFi Sensing" by Borna Barahimi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a novel network for real-time sensing and compression, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the evaluation of the proposed method. The introduction provides context about WiFi sensing and references various studies, indicating that datasets may be discussed further in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors specifically mention using the **UT-HAR dataset** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its characteristics and the context in which it is used.

In the **experimental settings** section, the authors describe the UT-HAR dataset in detail, stating that it was collected using Intel 5300 NIC and consists of continuous CSI data segmented into approximately 5000 samples, each with 250 frames of CSI matrices. The dataset encompasses seven distinct categories for human activity recognition, which is crucial for understanding its application in the study.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the UT-HAR dataset. The citation is as follows:
> S. Yousefi, H. Narui, S. Dayal, S. Ermon, and S. Valaee. "A survey on behavior recognition using WiFi channel state information." IEEE Commun. Mag., vol. 55, no. 10, pp. 98â€“104, 2017.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **UT-HAR Dataset**: This dataset is used for human activity recognition and consists of approximately 5000 samples, each containing 250 frames of CSI matrices. It includes seven categories of human activities: lie down, fall, walk, run, sit down, stand up, and empty room.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and citation for any further processing or review.
