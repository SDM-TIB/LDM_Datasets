To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AfriWOZ: Corpus for Exploiting Cross-Lingual Transferability for Generation of Dialogues in Low-Resource, African Languages" by Tosin Adewumi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created high-quality dialogue datasets for six African languages, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (An African Dialogue Dataset: AfriWOZ)**, where the authors describe the AfriWOZ dataset. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of dialogue data for six languages: Swahili, Wolof, Hausa, Nigerian Pidgin English, Kinyarwanda, and Yorùbá. Each language has 1,500 dialogue turns, which is crucial information for dataset description.

In this section, the authors also reference the **MultiWOZ dataset** as the base for their translations. They explain that they extracted and translated specific turns from the MultiWOZ dataset to create the AfriWOZ dataset. This indicates that MultiWOZ is another dataset I need to include.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for both the AfriWOZ dataset and the MultiWOZ dataset:

1. **AfriWOZ Dataset**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for AfriWOZ since it is a new dataset introduced by the authors. However, I can summarize its details:
   - Dataset Name: AfriWOZ
   - Languages: Swahili, Wolof, Hausa, Nigerian Pidgin English, Kinyarwanda, Yorùbá
   - Total Turns: 1,500 per language
   - Domains: Hotel, restaurant, taxi, and booking
   - License: CC-BY 4.0

2. **MultiWOZ Dataset**: The citation for the MultiWOZ dataset is:
   > Budzianowski, P., Wen, T.-H., Tseng, B.-H., Casanueva, I., Ultes, S., Ramadan, O., & Gašić, M. (2018). *MultiWOZ - A large-scale multi-domain Wizard-of-Oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 5016–5026, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets mentioned in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
