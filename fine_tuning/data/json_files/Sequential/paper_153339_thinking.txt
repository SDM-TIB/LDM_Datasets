To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining and Interpreting LSTMs" by Leila Arras et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention specific datasets used in the experiments. In the abstract, the authors discuss the application of their methods to sentiment analysis and a toy numeric task, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be present.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) to identify any datasets explicitly mentioned. The authors describe their validation experiments, including a sentiment prediction task using the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

I will also check the **background section** (Section 2) for any references to datasets used in prior works or foundational studies that may be relevant to their research. However, it appears that the primary dataset mentioned for their experiments is the SST.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to gather full citations for the datasets identified. The citation for the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank** is as follows:
- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J.Y., Chuang, J., Manning, C.D., Ng, A.Y., Potts, C. (2013). *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 1631â€“1642. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
