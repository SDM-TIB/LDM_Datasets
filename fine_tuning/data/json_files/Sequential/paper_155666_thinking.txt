To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Multimodal Fusion for Humor Detection" by Haojie Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper focuses on the MuSe-Humor sub-challenge, which suggests that a specific dataset is used for humor detection.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used. Here, they specifically mention the **Passau Spontaneous Football Coach Humor (Passau-SFCH) dataset**, which is crucial for the humor detection task. The authors provide details about the dataset, including its composition of audiovisual recordings from German football Bundesliga press conferences and the annotations for humor displayed by the coaches.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide statistics about the Passau-SFCH dataset, including the number of coaches, labels, and total duration of the recordings. This information is essential for describing the dataset comprehensively.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Passau-SFCH dataset. However, since this dataset appears to be novel and specific to the MuSe 2022 challenge, it may not have a separate citation in the references. Instead, I will note that the dataset is part of the MuSe 2022 challenge as described in the paper.

The relevant citation for the paper itself, which includes the dataset, is:
> Haojie Xu, Weifeng Liu, Jingwei Liu, Mingzheng Li, Yu Feng, Yasi Peng, Yunwei Shi, Xiao Sun, and Meng Wang. 2022. Hybrid Multimodal Fusion for Humor Detection. In Proceedings of the 3rd International Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Workshop and Challenge (MuSeâ€™ 22), October 10, 2022, Lisboa, Portugal. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 7 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3551876.3554802

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as part of the overall paper citation.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the focus on humor detection and the associated dataset.
2. Examine the experiments section for specific details about the Passau-SFCH dataset.
3. Note the statistics provided in the paper for a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.
4. Retrieve the citation for the paper, which serves as the reference for the dataset.

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entry for the Passau-SFCH dataset.
