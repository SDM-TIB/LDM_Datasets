To extract datasets from the research paper titled "N-ary Relation Extraction using Graph State LSTM" by Linfeng Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the relevance of their work in the context of relation extraction. They reference previous works, which may lead to the identification of datasets used in those studies.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 6 (Experiments)**, the authors mention using a dataset from Peng et al. (2017) for their experiments. They describe the dataset as focusing on drug-gene-mutation ternary relations extracted from PubMed, containing 6987 ternary instances and 6087 binary instances. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the dataset used in their evaluation.

I will also check the **statistics table (Table 2)**, which summarizes the dataset characteristics, including the average number of tokens and sentences. This reinforces the information about the dataset's structure and size.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the dataset mentioned is:

- For the dataset from **Peng et al. (2017)**, the citation is:
  > Nanyun Peng, Hoifung Poon, Chris Quirk, Kristina Toutanova, and Wen-tau Yih. *Cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction with graph LSTMs*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 5:101â€“115, 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured output for any further processing or review.
