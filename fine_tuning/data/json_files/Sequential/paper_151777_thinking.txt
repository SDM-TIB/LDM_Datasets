To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Distributions of Meant Color" by Lyndon White et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses a model for understanding color language and mentions a "held-out dataset" for evaluation, which suggests that there is a dataset involved, but it does not specify its name.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors refer to the "Munroe dataset" as a significant resource for their work. This is a promising lead, as it indicates that this dataset is likely central to their research.

Moving on to the **experimental setup** section, specifically **section 4.1**, I will find detailed information about the datasets used. The authors explicitly state that they utilize the "Munroe dataset," which is derived from the XKCD color survey. They provide specifics about how this dataset was prepared, including the number of observations and the filtering criteria applied.

In this section, the authors mention:
- The **Munroe dataset**: This dataset consists of over 3.4 million observations collected from over 222,500 respondents, focusing on color descriptions and their corresponding points in HSV color-space. The authors also note that they restricted the dataset to responses from native English speakers and removed rare color names.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Munroe dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Randall Munroe. *XKCD: Color survey results*. 2010.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **Munroe dataset**: A large dataset derived from the XKCD color survey, containing over 3.4 million observations from more than 222,500 respondents, focusing on color descriptions and their corresponding HSV values.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.
