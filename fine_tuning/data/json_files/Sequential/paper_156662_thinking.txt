To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-task Learning-based Joint CSI Prediction and Predictive Transmitter Selection for Security" by Shashi Bhushan Kotwal et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention if any datasets were used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe the dataset generation process. In this paper, they mention generating a time series CSI dataset using specific parameters outlined in **Table I**. This table is crucial as it provides the details necessary to understand the dataset's characteristics.

In **Table I**, the authors list parameters for dataset generation, including:
- Carrier centre frequency (fc)
- Sampling frequency (fs)
- Channel fading model
- Number of paths
- Historical and predicted CSI values
- Training and test data observations

These parameters indicate that the dataset is synthetic and generated based on the specified conditions rather than being sourced from an existing dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to see if the authors cite any existing datasets or related works that might have datasets relevant to their study. However, it appears that the focus is primarily on the generated dataset.

The paper does not explicitly mention any external datasets used for validation or comparison, which means I will only document the generated dataset based on the parameters provided.

The citation for the paper itself, which includes the dataset information, is:
> Shashi Bhushan Kotwal, Chinmoy Kundu, Sudhakar Modem, Holger Claussen, and Lester Ho. *Multi-task Learning-based Joint CSI Prediction and Predictive Transmitter Selection for Security*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communications, 2024.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information extracted from the paper:

1. **Generated CSI Dataset**: This dataset is created based on the parameters specified in Table I, which includes various settings for simulating channel state information in a mobile communication scenario.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
