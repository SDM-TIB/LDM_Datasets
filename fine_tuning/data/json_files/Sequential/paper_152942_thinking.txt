To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CharBot: A Simple and Effective Method for Evading DGA Classifiers" by Jonathan Peck et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not list datasets explicitly, it sets the context for the research.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain detailed information about each dataset, including their sources and characteristics.

In section IV, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **Alexa Dataset**: This dataset consists of the top 1 million unique domain names from Alexa, which ranks websites based on their popularity. The authors note that these domains are generally considered benign.

2. **Bambenek Dataset**: This dataset includes 1 million unique DGA domain names collected from Bambenek Consulting feeds over three specific days. These domains are associated with known malware families.

3. **Qname Dataset**: This dataset comprises 1 million unique domain names derived from a real-time stream of passive DNS data. The authors describe the heuristic rules used to label these domains as benign.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **Alexa Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alexa. "Top Sites." [Online]. Available: https://www.alexa.com/topsites. Accessed: 2019-02-08.

- For the **Bambenek Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bambenek Consulting. "OSINT Feeds." [Online]. Available: http://osint.bambenekconsulting.com/feeds/. Accessed: 2019-02-10.

- For the **Qname Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Passive DNS Data. "Real-time DNS Traffic." [Online]. Available: [URL not specified in the text]. Accessed: [Date not specified in the text].

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
