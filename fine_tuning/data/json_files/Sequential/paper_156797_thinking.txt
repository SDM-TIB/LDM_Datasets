To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classification of Heart Sounds Using Multi-Branch Deep Convolutional Network and LSTM-CNN" by Seyed Amir Latifi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study addresses the challenge of diagnosing cardiac abnormalities, which suggests that datasets related to heart sounds are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of heart sound analysis and the lack of adequate databases in this field. This section may provide insights into specific datasets used in their experiments.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their analysis. They refer to the **PhysioNet/CinC 2016 dataset**, which comprises 4,430 recordings from 1,072 subjects, totaling 233,512 heart sounds. This dataset is crucial for their study, as it allows them to evaluate their proposed methods.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PhysioNet/CinC 2016 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> PhysioNet. (2016). Classification of Normal/Abnormal Heart Sound Recordings, the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge. Retrieved from https://www.physionet.org/challenge/2016/#challenge-data

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **PhysioNet/CinC 2016 Dataset**: This dataset includes 4,430 recordings from 1,072 subjects, with a total of 233,512 heart sounds. It is divided into normal and abnormal classes and consists of recordings from various sources.

With this information, I will prepare to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper.
