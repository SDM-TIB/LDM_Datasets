To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Difference Variational Auto-Encoder" by Karol Gregor et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for evaluation. If the authors mention any datasets here, I will note them down.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 5) in detail, as this is where datasets are typically described in relation to the experiments conducted. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were used in the experiments.

In the experiments section, the authors discuss several tasks, including "partially observed MiniPacman," "Moving MNIST," and "noisy harmonic oscillator." I will check if they provide any specific datasets for these tasks or if they refer to existing datasets.

I will also look for a **datasets section** or any subsection that explicitly lists the datasets used in the experiments. If such a section exists, it will likely contain detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their sizes, formats, and any relevant citations.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using the "Moving MNIST" dataset, I will look for the original paper or source that introduced this dataset and note down the citation. Similarly, if they refer to "DeepMind Lab," I will find the appropriate citation for that dataset as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are clear and concise, making it easy for readers to understand the context and relevance of each dataset in relation to the research conducted in the paper.
