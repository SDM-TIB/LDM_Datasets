To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Scalable and Effective Alternative to Graph Transformers" by Kaan Sancak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any subsections that specifically discuss datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Data Collection." 

In **section 4.1**, the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. They mention the following datasets:

1. **Long Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB)**: This dataset is used to evaluate the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies in graphs. It consists of multiple graphs with varying characteristics.

2. **Open Graph Benchmark (OGB)**: This is another collection of datasets used for graph learning tasks, including molecular property prediction and node classification.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Long Range Graph Benchmark**, the citation is:
> Vijay Prakash Dwivedi, Ladislav Rampášek, Michael Galkin, Ali Parviz, Guy Wolf, Anh Tuan Luu, and Dominique Beaini. *Long range graph benchmark*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35:22326–22340, 2022.

For the **Open Graph Benchmark**, the citation is:
> Weihua Hu, Matthias Fey, Hongyu Ren, Maho Nakata, Yuxiao Dong, and Jure Leskovec. *Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33:22118–22133, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper citations for each one.
