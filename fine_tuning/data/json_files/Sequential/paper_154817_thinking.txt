To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving the expressiveness of neural vocoding with non-afﬁne Normalizing Flows" by Adam Gabryś et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on a "multi-speaker, multi-lingual dataset," which suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **Training Dataset**: This dataset consists of recordings from 22 male and 52 female voices speaking 27 languages and dialects in 10 different speaking styles, with approximately 3000 utterances per speaker.

2. **Evaluation Dataset**: This dataset contains 2700 recorded sentences covering 20 languages with 26 speakers in 10 different speaking styles, balanced with at least 100 recordings per style and 50 per speaker.

Both datasets are described in terms of their composition and purpose, which is crucial for understanding their role in the research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used, as they appear to be internal datasets created by the authors for their experiments. Therefore, I will note that these datasets are not publicly available or cited in the literature.

In summary, I will create entries for the datasets based on the information gathered:

1. **Training Dataset**: A multi-speaker, multi-lingual dataset with 22 male and 52 female voices, 27 languages, and approximately 3000 utterances per speaker.

2. **Evaluation Dataset**: A dataset containing 2700 recorded sentences from 26 speakers across 20 languages and 10 different speaking styles.

Since there are no formal citations available for these datasets, I will indicate that they are internal datasets without external references.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
