To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Electric Field Evaluation of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface in Wireless Networks" by Zhuangzhuang Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure and the evaluation of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), which may hint at the use of specific datasets for simulations or measurements.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Evaluations)**, where the authors discuss the use of simulation software and methodologies for evaluating the E-field. This section is likely to contain specific datasets or references to datasets used in their analysis. I will look for any mentions of datasets related to EMF exposure measurements, simulation parameters, or any other relevant data.

In **section V (Measurement Methodology)**, the authors outline the measurement procedures and considerations for EMF exposure. This section may include references to datasets used for calibration or validation of their measurement techniques.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for ensuring that I provide accurate and complete citations for each dataset.

For example, if the authors refer to datasets from previous studies or specific measurement datasets, I will note down the full citation format as follows:

- If a dataset is mentioned as being derived from a specific study, I will include the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.
- If the dataset is publicly available or comes from a specific organization, I will include that information as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the details, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all citations are formatted correctly and that the descriptions are clear and concise.
