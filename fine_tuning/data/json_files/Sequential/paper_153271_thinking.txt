To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Auto-GNN: Neural Architecture Search of Graph Neural Networks" by Kaixiong Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using **Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed**, and **PPI** for node classification tasks. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

In **subsection 6.1 (Datasets)**, the authors provide specific statistics for each dataset, which will be crucial for my extraction. Hereâ€™s what I find:

1. **Cora**: A citation network with 2,708 nodes, 1,433 features, 7 classes, and specific numbers of training, validation, and testing nodes.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network with 3,327 nodes, 3,703 features, 6 classes, and similar training, validation, and testing configurations.
3. **Pubmed**: A dataset with 19,717 nodes, 500 features, 3 classes, and a defined training, validation, and testing setup.
4. **PPI**: A dataset for inductive learning with 56,944 nodes, 50 features, and 121 classes, used in a different training setup.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the sources for Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed, which are commonly used datasets in the field. The citation for PPI is also provided.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **Cora**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **Citeseer**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **Pubmed**:
  > Namata, G., Sen, P., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **PPI**:
  > Zitnik, M., & Leskovec, J. (2017). Predicting multicellular function through multi-layer tissue networks. *Bioinformatics*, 33(14), i190-i198.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured the details as presented in the paper.
