To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatio-Temporal Video Autoencoder with Differentiable Memory" by Viorica P˘atr˘aucean, Ankur Handa, and Roberto Cipolla, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the architecture and its application in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation, but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of video sequence understanding and the lack of labeled data, which suggests that datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

I will then examine the **experiments section** (section 5) closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this section, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Moving MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of sequences of 20 frames each, generated by moving MNIST digit images. The authors state they generated 10,000 sequences for training and 3,000 for validation.

2. **HMDB-51 Dataset**: This dataset is used for training their architecture on real videos, containing about 107,000 frames in total.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Moving MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nitish Srivastava, Elman Mansimov, and Ruslan Salakhutdinov. *Unsupervised learning of video representations using LSTMs*. In ICML, 2015.

- For the **HMDB-51 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Garrote, E., Poggio, T., & Serre, T. *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
