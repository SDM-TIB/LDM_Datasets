To extract datasets from the research paper titled "User-Initiated Repetition-Based Recovery in Multi-Utterance Dialogue Systems" by Hoang Long Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed model on data collected for the task, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail the dataset used for training and evaluation. They mention that the model is trained on an internally collected dataset, which consists of approximately 350,000 turn pairs generated from transcribed speech data. Additionally, they specify that a fully annotated test set with 9,200 turn pairs is used for evaluation.

In this section, the authors provide statistics about the evaluation dataset, indicating that it reflects typical user interactions, where the majority of follow-ups are not corrections. This information is crucial for understanding the context of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, since the dataset is internally collected and not publicly available, there may not be a formal citation for it. In this case, I will note that the dataset is proprietary to the authors' organization (Apple) and does not have a publicly accessible citation.

Based on this analysis, I will summarize the findings for the dataset as follows:

1. **Internally Collected Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 350,000 turn pairs generated from transcribed speech data, used for training the model. The evaluation dataset contains 9,200 annotated turn pairs.

Since there are no formal citations for the internally collected dataset, I will indicate that it is proprietary and does not have a publicly available reference.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and documentation purposes.
