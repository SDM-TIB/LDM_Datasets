To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FishNet: A Camera Localizer using Deep Recurrent Networks" by Hsin-I Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on three benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that their method was evaluated on three publicly available datasets:

1. **Cambridge Landmark dataset**: This dataset is noted for its outdoor sequences and challenges related to urban clutter and partial occlusions.

2. **7-Scenes dataset**: This dataset is used for indoor scenes and contains significant variations in camera height.

3. **Multi-FoV synthetic dataset**: This dataset includes synthetic sequences that simulate different camera optics.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **Cambridge Landmark dataset**:
  > A. Kendall, M. Grimes, and R. Cipolla. *PoseNet: A convolutional network for real-time 6-dof camera relocalization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2938–2946, 2015.

- For the **7-Scenes dataset**:
  > A. Shotton, B. Glocker, C. Zach, S. Izadi, A. Criminisi, and A. W. Fitzgibbon. *Scene coordinate regression forests for camera relocalization in RGB-D images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2930–2937, 2013.

- For the **Multi-FoV synthetic dataset**:
  > Z. Zhang, H. Rebecq, C. Forster, and D. Scaramuzza. *Benefit of large field-of-view cameras for visual odometry*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 801–808, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
