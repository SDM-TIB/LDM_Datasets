To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Analysis and an Eigen Initializer for Recurrent Neural Networks" by Ran Dou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions testing on several datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V), where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Tomita Grammar**: This dataset is mentioned as a set of strings with an alphabet {0, 1} that follows predefined rules. It is widely used for deterministic finite automata (DFA) extraction.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: The paper refers to the sequential MNIST dataset, which is used for classification tasks. It involves presenting 28 pixels from the same row as input.

3. **Multi30k Dataset**: This dataset is described as a multi-modal dataset used for machine translation and image description, containing pairs of descriptions in German and English.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Tomita Grammar**, the citation is:
  > M. Tomita, “Dynamic construction of finite automata from examples using hill-climbing,” in Proceedings of the Fourth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1982, pp. 105–108.

- For **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun, C. Cortes, and C. J. Burges, “The MNIST database of handwritten digits,” 2010. [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For **Multi30k Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Elliott, S. Frank, K. Sima’an, and L. Specia, “Multi30k: Multilingual English-German image descriptions,” CoRR, vol. abs/1605.00459, 2016. [Online]. Available: http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00459

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
