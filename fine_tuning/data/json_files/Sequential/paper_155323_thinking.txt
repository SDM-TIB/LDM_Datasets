To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Precise Stock Price Prediction for Optimized Portfolio Design Using an LSTM Model" by Jaydip Sen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that past stock prices are extracted from the web, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **Data Acquisition** subsection. Here, the authors specify that they extracted historical prices of stocks from the Yahoo Finance site for the period from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020. This indicates that the dataset consists of stock prices for various companies over a five-year period.

I will also note the specific sectors and stocks mentioned in the paper, as they are crucial for understanding the dataset's context. The authors discuss seven sectors of the Indian economy and the five most significant stocks from each sector, which will help in detailing the dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors present various tables that summarize the performance of the portfolios based on the extracted stock prices. These tables provide insights into the actual and predicted returns for each sector, further confirming the dataset's relevance.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:
