To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predictive Change Point Detection for Heterogeneous Data" by Anna-Christina Glock et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were collected.

In **subsection 3.1 (Data for Experiments)**, the authors mention that they used five different tribological datasets. I will note the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **Dataset 1**: This dataset includes measurements during the run-in, steady-state, and divergent wear phases.
2. **Dataset 2**: Similar to Dataset 1 but with different characteristics.
3. **Dataset 3**: Contains data from a different experimental setup.
4. **Dataset 5**: Another dataset with distinct wear phases.
5. **Dataset 7**: The final dataset used in the experiments.

I will also look for any specific details about how these datasets were collected or processed, as this information is crucial for understanding their context.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. The authors may reference previous works or datasets that are foundational to their research. If the datasets are original, I will note that they are part of the current study.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset from a previous study, I will extract the citation as follows:

- For **Dataset 1**, if it is based on a previous study, I will find the citation:
  > Glock, A.-C., Sobieczky, F., Jech, M. (2019). Detection of anomalous events in the wear-behaviour of continuously recorded sliding friction pairs. In Conference Proceedings ¨OTG-Tagung 2019, 30–40.

- For **Dataset 2**, if it is original, I will note that it is part of the current study without a separate citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation where applicable. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
