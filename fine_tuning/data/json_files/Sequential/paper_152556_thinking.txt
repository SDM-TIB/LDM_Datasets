To extract datasets from the research paper titled "XNLI: Evaluating Cross-lingual Sentence Representations" by Alexis Conneau et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates the creation of a dataset called **XNLI**, which is a good starting point. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset's purpose and its extension to 15 languages.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant subsections that provide detailed descriptions. In this paper, the dataset is discussed in **Section 3 (The XNLI Corpus)**. Here, the authors describe the XNLI dataset, which consists of 7,500 human-annotated examples in a natural language inference format across 15 languages, totaling 112,500 annotated pairs.

I will note the specifics of the dataset:
- **XNLI Dataset**: This dataset is designed for evaluating cross-lingual sentence understanding and includes examples in English, French, Spanish, German, Greek, Bulgarian, Russian, Turkish, Arabic, Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese, Hindi, Swahili, and Urdu.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** for the full citation of the dataset. The authors reference the original Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Corpus (MultiNLI) as the basis for XNLI. The citation for the MultiNLI dataset is as follows:
> Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 632â€“640, 2015.

Since XNLI is derived from MultiNLI, I will ensure to include this citation when documenting the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets extracted from the paper.
