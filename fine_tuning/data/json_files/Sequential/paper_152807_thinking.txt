To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GANSYNTH: ADVERSARIAL NEURAL AUDIO SYNTHESIS" by Jesse Engel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **NSynth dataset**, which is a key dataset used in the research. This indicates that I should look for more details about this dataset in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors describe the NSynth dataset as containing individual notes from musical instruments across various pitches, timbres, and volumes. This reinforces the importance of the NSynth dataset in their research.

I will then focus on the **experimental details** section, specifically **section 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the NSynth dataset. They mention that it contains 300,000 musical notes from 1,000 different instruments, with attributes for pitch, velocity, instrument type, and acoustic qualities. This section confirms the dataset's structure and the specific characteristics that make it suitable for their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the NSynth dataset, I will check the **references section** of the paper. The authors cite the original NSynth paper as follows:
> Jesse Engel, Cinjon Resnick, Adam Roberts, Sander Dieleman, Douglas Eck, Karen Simonyan, and Mohammad Norouzi. *Neural audio synthesis of musical notes with WaveNet autoencoders*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **NSynth Dataset**: Contains 300,000 musical notes from 1,000 different instruments, with labels for pitch, velocity, instrument type, and acoustic qualities.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
