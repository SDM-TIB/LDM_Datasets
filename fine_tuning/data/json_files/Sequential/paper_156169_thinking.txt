To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Hidden Markov LSTM for Short-Term Traffic Flow Prediction" by Agnimitra Sengupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on traffic flow prediction, which suggests that traffic datasets may be involved.

Next, I will examine the **data section** more closely, as it is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention that they used a dataset obtained from the **California Department of Transportation’s Performance Measurement System (PeMS)**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized for their experiments.

I will note the specifics provided about the dataset, including:
- The dataset consists of traffic data, including flow, occupancy, and speed, collected from vehicle detector stations (VDS).
- The data is sampled at 30-second intervals and aggregated at 5-minute intervals.
- The authors specifically used flow data for one year from **VDS 1114805** on California Interstate 05 NB in District 11, totaling **104,942 samples**.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the dataset in the **References section**. However, since the dataset is from a government source, it may not have a traditional citation format. Instead, I will summarize the source as follows:

- **California Department of Transportation’s Performance Measurement System (PeMS)**: This dataset is widely used for traffic data modeling and can be referenced as:
  > California Department of Transportation. *Performance Measurement System (PeMS)*. Available at: [https://pems.dot.ca.gov](https://pems.dot.ca.gov).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation for the PeMS dataset. This will allow for proper attribution and facilitate further research or validation by others.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference.
