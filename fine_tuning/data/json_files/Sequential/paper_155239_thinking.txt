To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Bounded Context-Free-Grammar via LSTM and the Transformer: Difference and Explanations" by Hui Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction and experiments sections are likely to contain specific details about the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the theoretical aspects of LSTM and Transformer models but do not mention any datasets directly. Therefore, I will move on to the **experiments section**.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. They mention the **Dyck-(k, m)** datasets, which are used to evaluate the models' performance on context-free languages. They also refer to the **SCAN dataset**, which is a semantic parsing dataset.

Next, I will gather detailed descriptions of these datasets:

1. **Dyck-(k, m) Datasets**: These datasets are generated for training and testing the models on context-free languages. The authors specify that they generated 50,000 sequences for training and another 50,000 for testing for each configuration of k and m.

2. **SCAN Dataset**: This dataset consists of commands in natural language and sequences of actions to execute those commands. The authors state that it contains 16,728 training samples and 16,728 test samples.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Dyck languages**, the original work is often attributed to:
  > Kozen, D. C. (1997). The Chomsky—Schützenberger Theorem. In Automata and Computability, 198–200. Springer.

- For the **SCAN dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lake, B. & Baroni, M. (2018). Generalization without systematicity: On the compositional skills of sequence-to-sequence recurrent networks. In International Conference on Machine Learning, 2873–2882. PMLR.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description and the full citation for each dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
