To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Augmenting Data with Mixup for Sentence Classification" by Hongyu Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the experiments. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using several benchmark datasets for sentence classification, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiment)**, where the authors list the datasets used for evaluation. They explicitly mention five benchmark tasks for sentence classification:

1. **TREC**: A dataset for categorizing questions into six types.
2. **MR (Movie Review)**: A dataset for detecting positive and negative movie reviews.
3. **SST-1 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: A dataset with five sentiment categories.
4. **SST-2**: A variant of SST-1 with neutral reviews removed, resulting in binary labels.
5. **Subj (Subjectivity)**: A dataset for classifying sentences as subjective or objective.

In this section, the authors provide a summary table (Table 1) that includes details about each dataset, such as the number of samples, vocabulary size, and average sentence length. This information is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of each dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
