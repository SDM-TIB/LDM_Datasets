To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ABI Neural Ensemble Model for Gender Prediction" by Eva Vanmassenhove et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the authors' participation in the CLIN29 shared task on gender prediction, which suggests that datasets related to this task may be present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. Here, they mention three different domains: Twitter (TW), YouTube (YT), and News (N). They describe how they utilized these datasets for both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, indicating that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

In this section, the authors also mention the use of external datasets, specifically **CSI** and **TwiSty**. I will need to ensure I capture these as well, as they are relevant to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **CSI (Clips a Dutch Stylometry Investigation Corpus)**:
   - Citation:
     > Verhoeven, B., & Daelemans, W. (2014). Clips a dutch stylometry investigation (csi) corpus: the detection of age, gender, personality, sentiment and deception in text. In *LREC 2014-NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION*, pages 3081–3085.

2. **TwiSty (Multilingual Twitter Stylometry Corpus)**:
   - Citation:
     > Verhoeven, B., Daelemans, W., & Plank, B. (2016). Twisty: a multilingual twitter stylometry corpus for gender and personality profiling. In *Proceedings of the 10th Annual Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016)*, pages 1–6.

3. **Twitter Dataset**:
   - The paper does not provide a specific citation for the Twitter dataset used in the shared task, but it is commonly referenced in related works. I will note that it is part of the PAN shared tasks.

4. **YouTube Dataset**:
   - Similar to the Twitter dataset, the YouTube dataset is part of the shared task and does not have a specific citation provided in this paper.

5. **News Dataset**:
   - Again, this dataset is part of the shared task and does not have a specific citation in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for CSI and TwiSty, while noting the Twitter, YouTube, and News datasets as part of the shared task without specific citations.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations.
