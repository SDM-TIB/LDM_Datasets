To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Representation Learning for Automatic Speech Recognition" by Guruprasad V Ramesh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates the use of the **Libri-Light** dataset for pre-training, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Libri-Light (Large)**: This dataset contains 52,000 hours of unlabeled speech data generated from 6,845 speakers. It is the primary dataset used for pre-training in their experiments.

2. **Librispeech**: This dataset is used for fine-tuning and consists of a 960-hour training partition. The authors also mention the dev and test splits, which are important for understanding the dataset's structure.

3. **Multilingual Librispeech (MLS) French**: This dataset is used for language adaptation experiments and consists of 1,070 hours of training data.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Libri-Light**, the citation is:
  > J. Kahn, M. Riviere, W. Zheng, E. Kharitonov, Q. Xu, P.-E. Mazaré, J. Karadayi, V. Liptchinsky, R. Collobert, C. Fuegen et al. "Libri-light: A benchmark for asr with limited or no supervision." In International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), IEEE, 2020, pp. 7669–7673.

- For **Librispeech**, the citation is:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. "Librispeech: an asr corpus based on public domain audio books." In International conference on acoustics, speech and signal processing (ICASSP), IEEE, 2015, pp. 5206–5210.

- For **Multilingual Librispeech (MLS) French**, the citation is:
  > V. Pratap, Q. Xu, A. Sriram, G. Synnaeve, and R. Collobert. "MLS: A large-scale multilingual dataset for speech research." arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.03411, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
