To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Spiking Neural Networks with Resonate-and-Fire Neurons" by Badr AlKhamissi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their formulation on both static and dynamic versions of the MNIST dataset, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods and Experiments section**, specifically **section 2.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This is the static version, consisting of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. The authors reference the original MNIST paper by Yann LeCun et al. (1998).

2. **N-MNIST Dataset**: This is the dynamic version derived from the MNIST dataset, created by panning and tilting a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) in front of a screen displaying the digits. The authors cite the work by Garrick Orchard et al. (2015) for this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **N-MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Garrick Orchard, Ajinkya Jayawant, Gregory K. Cohen, and Nitish Thakor. *Converting static image datasets to spiking neuromorphic datasets using saccades*. Frontiers in Neuroscience, 9:437, 2015. doi: 10.3389/fnins.2015.00437.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 28x28 grayscale images, widely used for training various image processing systems.

2. **N-MNIST Dataset**: A neuromorphic dataset derived from the MNIST dataset, created to simulate dynamic visual processing using a Dynamic Vision Sensor.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
