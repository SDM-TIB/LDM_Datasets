To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The LMU Munich System for the WMT 2020 Unsupervised Machine Translation Shared Task" by Alexandra Chronopoulou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the WMT 2020 shared task, which suggests the use of specific datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments** section, particularly focusing on the **data pre-processing** and **training** subsections. Here, the authors mention using the **WMT monolingual News Crawl dataset** for German, which consists of 327 million sentences collected from 2007 to 2019. This is a significant dataset for their experiments.

Additionally, I will look for any references to other datasets used for training or validation. The authors mention using **Upper Sorbian monolingual data** and **provided parallel data** for validation/testing, which includes a total of 756,000 sentences. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The citations I need to extract are:

1. For the **WMT monolingual News Crawl dataset**:
   > WMT monolingual News Crawl dataset. Available at: http://data.statmt.org/news-crawl/de/

2. For the **Upper Sorbian monolingual data**:
   > Upper Sorbian monolingual data provided by the WMT organizers. Available at: http://www.statmt.org/wmt20/unsup_and_very_low_res/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the study, facilitating further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
