To extract datasets from the research paper titled "kNN-BOX: A Unified Framework for Nearest Neighbor Generation" by Wenhao Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on benchmark machine translation datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, the authors list several datasets used for machine translation and other tasks:

1. **OPUS Datasets**: The authors mention using four German-English OPUS datasets (Medical, Law, IT, and Koran). This indicates that there are multiple datasets under the OPUS umbrella.

2. **TED Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating kNN-BOX on multilingual machine translation.

3. **Wiki-Auto Dataset**: This dataset is used for text simplification tasks.

4. **Newsela-Auto Dataset**: Another dataset for text simplification.

5. **QQP Dataset**: This dataset is used for paraphrase generation tasks.

6. **Quasar-T Dataset**: This dataset is used for question generation tasks.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **OPUS Datasets**, the citation is:
  > JÃ¶rg Tiedemann. *Parallel data, tools and interfaces in OPUS*. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC), 2012.

- For the **TED Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ye Qi, Devendra Sachan, Matthieu Felix, Sarguna Padmanabhan, and Graham Neubig. *When and why are pre-trained word embeddings useful for neural machine translation?* In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 2 (Short Papers), 2018.

- For the **Wiki-Auto Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chao Jiang, Mounica Maddela, Wuwei Lan, Yang Zhong, and Wei Xu. *Neural CRF model for sentence alignment in text simplification*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2020.

- For the **Newsela-Auto Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chao Jiang, Mounica Maddela, Wuwei Lan, Yang Zhong, and Wei Xu. *Neural CRF model for sentence alignment in text simplification*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2020.

- For the **QQP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bhuwan Dhingra, Kathryn Mazaitis, and William W. Cohen. *Quasar: Datasets for question answering by search and reading*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.03904, 2017.

- For the **Quasar-T Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bhuwan Dhingra, Kathryn Mazaitis, and William W. Cohen. *Quasar: Datasets for question answering by search and reading*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.03904, 2017.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
