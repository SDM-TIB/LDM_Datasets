To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Note on Learning Rare Events in Molecular Dynamics using LSTM and Transformer" by Wenqi Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Results)**, particularly the subsection titled **A. Datasets, Settings and Evaluation Metrics**. This section explicitly discusses the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention two datasets derived from molecular dynamics simulations of the alanine dipeptide system:

1. **alanineφ ψ dataset**: This dataset captures the conformational changes of the alanine dipeptide using the torsional angles φ and ψ. The authors describe how this dataset is constructed and its significance in the context of their experiments.

2. **alanineRMSD dataset**: This dataset is based on the root mean square deviation (RMSD) distances of the alanine dipeptide conformations. The authors explain that this dataset is created by clustering the conformational space into 100 states using a k-center clustering method.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for any original works or methods referenced in the creation of these datasets. The paper cites several foundational works related to Markov state models and molecular dynamics, which may provide context for the datasets.

For the **alanineφ ψ dataset**, the authors reference a previous study that utilized a similar model, which is:
> Sun-Ting Tsai, En-Jui Kuo, and Pratyush Tiwary. *Learning molecular dynamics with simple language model built upon long short-term memory neural network*. Nature communications, 11(1):1–11, 2020.

For the **alanineRMSD dataset**, the authors mention the k-center clustering method, which is discussed in:
> Yutong Zhao, Fu Kit Sheong, Jian Sun, Pedro Sander, and Xuhui Huang. *A fast parallel clustering algorithm for molecular simulation trajectories*. Journal of computational chemistry, 34(2):95–104, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets along with their full citations, which is crucial for any subsequent analysis or documentation.
