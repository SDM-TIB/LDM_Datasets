To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relation Network for Multi-label Aerial Image Classification" by Yuansheng Hua, Lichao Mou, and Xiao Xiang Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on **two multi-label aerial image datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Experiments)**, where the authors introduce the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention:

1. **UCM Multi-label Dataset**: This dataset is described as being reproduced by assigning new object labels to aerial images collected in the UCM dataset. It contains 2,100 images with 17 candidate object labels.

2. **AID Multi-label Dataset**: This is a newly produced dataset based on the AID scene classification dataset, consisting of 3,000 high-resolution aerial images with varying spatial resolutions and multiple object labels.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **dataset introduction subsection** (III.A), where the authors provide more specific information about each dataset, including the number of images, object categories, and the process of relabeling.

After confirming the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **UCM Multi-label Dataset**:
  > Chaudhuri, B., Demir, B., Chaudhuri, S., & Bruzzone, L. (2018). Multilabel remote sensing image retrieval using a semisupervised graph-theoretic method. *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*, 56(2), 1144-1158.

- For **AID Multi-label Dataset**:
  > Xia, G., Hu, J., Hu, F., Shi, B., Bai, X., Zhong, Y., Zhang, L., & Lu, X. (2017). AID: A benchmark data set for performance evaluation of aerial scene classification. *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*, 55(7), 3964-3977.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
