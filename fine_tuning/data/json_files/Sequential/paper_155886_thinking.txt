To extract datasets from the research paper titled "E3Pose: Energy-Efficient Edge-assisted Multi-camera System for Multi-human 3D Pose Estimation" by Letian Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Shelf Dataset**: This dataset contains 3200 video frames captured by five cameras in an indoor environment with four persons interacting. The authors reference this dataset multiple times throughout the paper, indicating its significance in their experiments.

2. **Panoptic Dataset**: This dataset is captured in a closed studio with 480 VGA cameras and 31 HD cameras, designed to simulate and capture social activities of multiple people. The authors specify that they use a subset of this dataset for their evaluations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **Shelf Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Vasileios Belagiannis, Sikandar Amin, Mykhaylo Andriluka, Bernt Schiele, Nassir Navab, and Slobodan Ilic. *3D Pictorial Structures for Multiple Human Pose Estimation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1669–1676, 2014.

- For the **Panoptic Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hanbyul Joo, Hao Liu, Lei Tan, Lin Gui, Bart Nabbe, Iain Matthews, Takeo Kanade, Shohei Nobuhara, and Yaser Sheikh. *Panoptic Studio: A Massively Multiview System for Social Motion Capture*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 3334–3342, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
