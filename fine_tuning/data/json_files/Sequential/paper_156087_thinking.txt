To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stock and market index prediction using Informer network" by Yuze Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on stock price prediction using various networks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled **2.2 Stock data acquisition**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they selected two stock price indices and two company stocks: **Hong Kong Hang Seng Index (HSI)**, **NASDAQ Index (IXIC)**, **Tencent Holdings Ltd**, and **Apple Inc. (AAPL)**. The paper provides details about the data, including the time periods and the frequency of the data (1-minute and 5-minute).

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used in the experiments and to gather any additional details about how they were utilized.

The paper specifies the time periods for the datasets:
- **HSI**: 1-minute data from January 3, 2022, to December 12, 2022.
- **IXIC**: 5-minute data from April 5, 2021, to December 12, 2022.
- **Tencent Holdings Ltd**: 1-minute and 5-minute data for the same periods as HSI.
- **Apple Inc. (AAPL)**: 1-minute and 5-minute data for the same periods as HSI.

Next, I will look at the **data availability section** to find the source of the datasets. The authors mention that the data used to support the findings of the study are available from **Tongdaxin Financial Terminal, Shenzhen Fortune Trend Technology Co., Ltd**.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset based on the information gathered:

1. **Hong Kong Hang Seng Index (HSI)**:
   > Data from Tongdaxin Financial Terminal, Shenzhen Fortune Trend Technology Co., Ltd. (2022). 1-minute data from January 3, 2022, to December 12, 2022.

2. **NASDAQ Index (IXIC)**:
   > Data from Tongdaxin Financial Terminal, Shenzhen Fortune Trend Technology Co., Ltd. (2022). 5-minute data from April 5, 2021, to December 12, 2022.

3. **Tencent Holdings Ltd**:
   > Data from Tongdaxin Financial Terminal, Shenzhen Fortune Trend Technology Co., Ltd. (2022). 1-minute and 5-minute data from January 3, 2022, to December 12, 2022.

4. **Apple Inc. (AAPL)**:
   > Data from Tongdaxin Financial Terminal, Shenzhen Fortune Trend Technology Co., Ltd. (2022). 1-minute and 5-minute data from January 3, 2022, to December 12, 2022.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details and citations for each dataset before compiling them into a structured format for further use.
