To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IBERT: Idiom Cloze-style reading comprehension with Attention" by Ruiyang Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on the **EPIE Static Corpus dataset**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Data)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they specify that the **EPIE dataset** consists of 359 idiom candidates and a total of 21,890 sentences. This section will provide the necessary details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

In addition, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference other datasets in the related work section, such as **RACE** and **Children’s Book Test (CBT)**, but these are not used in their experiments. Therefore, I will focus on the **EPIE dataset** for extraction.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the **EPIE dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:
> Prateek Saxena and Soma Paul. *EPIE Dataset: A Corpus for Possible Idiomatic Expressions*. In Text, Speech, and Dialogue, Petr Sojka, Ivan Kopeček, Karel Pala, and Aleš Horák (Eds.). Springer International Publishing, Cham, 87–94, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the **EPIE dataset**, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ready for further processing or review.
