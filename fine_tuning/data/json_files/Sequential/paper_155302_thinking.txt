To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continuous Speech for Improved Learning Pathological Voice Disorders" by Syu-Siang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses a "large-scale database" of continuous speech recordings collected from a speech clinic, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, specifically the **Database Description** subsection. Here, the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. They mention two key datasets:

1. **FEMH Voice Disorder Database**: This dataset consists of 1,045 continuous speech recordings collected from patients diagnosed with various voice disorders, including functional dysphonia, neoplasm, phonotrauma, and vocal palsy. Each recording includes seven Chinese sentences.

2. **FEMH-Challenge Database**: This is a balanced dataset used for further evaluation, comprising 150 /a/-vowel sounds pronounced by different patients, classified into neoplasm, phonotrauma, and vocal palsy.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The FEMH Voice Disorder Database is associated with the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, but the paper does not provide a specific citation for it. However, the FEMH-Challenge is referenced in the context of a competition, which may have its own citation.

For the **FEMH-Challenge Database**, I will refer to the following citation:
- Ramalingam, A., Kedari, S., & Vuppalapati, C. (2018). IEEE FEMH voice data challenge 2018. In Proceedings of Big Data, pp. 5272–5276.

Since the FEMH Voice Disorder Database does not have a specific citation in the paper, I will note that it is a dataset collected by the speech clinic of Far Eastern Memorial Hospital from 2012 to 2019.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details and citations for each dataset in the required format.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **FEMH Voice Disorder Database**: Collected from the speech clinic of Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, Taiwan, from 2012 to 2019.
2. **FEMH-Challenge Database**: Ramalingam, A., Kedari, S., & Vuppalapati, C. (2018). IEEE FEMH voice data challenge 2018. In Proceedings of Big Data, pp. 5272–5276.

I will now prepare the structured output for these datasets.
