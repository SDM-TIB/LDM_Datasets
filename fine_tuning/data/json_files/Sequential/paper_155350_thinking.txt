To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transforming Sequence Tagging Into A Seq2Seq Task" by Karthik Raman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **seven diverse public benchmarks**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. I will look for any tables or descriptions that provide details about each dataset, including their names, languages, and any relevant statistics.

In the datasets section, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **mATIS**: A multilingual generalization of the ATIS dataset, which includes various languages such as English, Hindi, and Turkish.
2. **SNIPS**: A dataset for natural language understanding tasks, primarily in English.
3. **MovieTrivia**: A dataset used for named entity recognition tasks, also in English.
4. **Movies**: Another dataset related to movie-related queries, primarily in English.
5. **Restaurant**: A dataset used for restaurant-related queries, primarily in English.
6. **mTOP**: A multilingual task-oriented semantic parsing benchmark that includes several languages.
7. **mTOD**: A multilingual dataset for task-oriented dialog.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For **mATIS**:

- For **MovieTrivia**:
  > This dataset is commonly referenced in various NER tasks but does not have a specific citation in the paper. It is often attributed to the MIT datasets.

- For **Movies** and **Restaurant**:
  > These datasets are also part of the MIT datasets and can be referenced similarly.

- For **mTOP**:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
