To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Chinese Medical Question Answer Matching Based on Interactive Sentence Representation Learning" by Xiongtao Cui and Jungang Han, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets, which suggests that I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They refer to the **cMedQA V2.0** and **cMedQA V1.0** datasets, providing some context about their construction and purpose. 

In this section, the authors describe the cMedQA V2.0 dataset as being derived from an online Chinese medical health community and provide statistics about the average number of characters in questions and answers. They also mention that the cMedQA V1.0 dataset is the initial version of cMedQA V2.0, which was collected by Zhang et al.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:

- For **cMedQA V1.0**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Sheng, Zhang, X., Wang, H., Cheng, J., Li, P., & Ding, Z. (2017). Chinese Medical Question Answer Matching Using End-to-End Character-Level Multi-Scale CNNs. *Applied Sciences (Switzerland)*, 7, 10.3390/app7080767.

- For **cMedQA V2.0**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Sheng, Zhang, Xin, Wang, Hui, Guo, Lixiang, & Liu, Shanshan. (2018). Multi-Scale Attentive Interaction Networks for Chinese Medical Question Answer Selection. *IEEE Access*, PP. 1-1, 10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2883637.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow for proper documentation and referencing of the datasets used in the research.
