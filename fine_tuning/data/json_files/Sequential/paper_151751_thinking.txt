To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Number Sequence Prediction Problems for Evaluating Computational Powers of Neural Networks" by Hyoungwook Nam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of number sequence prediction tasks, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe two types of problems: number-level and digit-level sequence prediction problems. They mention that they generated sequences using various linear homogeneous recurrence relations, which indicates that the datasets are synthetically generated rather than sourced from existing datasets. 

I will note the following key points regarding the datasets:

1. **Number-level Sequence Datasets**: The authors generated sequences based on recurrence relations. They mention using sequences of different types, such as Fibonacci and arithmetic sequences, but do not provide specific dataset names since these are generated for the purpose of the study.

2. **Digit-level Sequence Datasets**: Similar to the number-level datasets, the digit-level sequences are also generated based on specific rules. The authors describe the input and target sequences but again do not reference any external datasets.

Since the datasets are synthetically generated, I will not find traditional citations for them. However, I will document the generation rules and characteristics of these datasets as they are crucial for understanding the experiments.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include the generation rules and characteristics as part of the dataset descriptions. I will also note that there are no external citations for these datasets since they are not sourced from existing datasets.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information in a clear and concise manner, ready for any further processing or review.
