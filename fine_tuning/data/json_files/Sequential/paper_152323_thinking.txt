To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-end Sequence Labeling via Bi-directional LSTM-CNNs-CRF" by Xuezhe Ma and Eduard Hovy, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they evaluate their system on two datasets for sequence labeling tasks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data Sets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Penn Treebank WSJ corpus**: This dataset is used for part-of-speech (POS) tagging. The authors mention that it contains 38,219 training sentences, 5,462 development sentences, and 5,527 test sentences.

2. **CoNLL 2003 corpus**: This dataset is used for named entity recognition (NER). The authors provide statistics indicating it has 14,987 training sentences, 3,466 development sentences, and 3,684 test sentences.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets are indeed the ones they utilized for their evaluations, which solidifies their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Penn Treebank WSJ corpus**, the citation is:
  > Mitchell Marcus, Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313–330, 1993.

- For the **CoNLL 2003 corpus**, the citation is:
  > Erik F. Tjong Kim Sang and Fien De Meulder. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of CoNLL-2003, pages 142–147, 2003.

With these citations in hand, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included as required.
