To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Stamp Classifier: Classifying Short Sequences of Astronomical Alerts" by Daniel Neira O. et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of alerts from the **Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)** survey, which indicates that this survey is a primary source of data for the study.

Next, I will focus on the **data sections** of the paper, particularly where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In the section titled **"A Data,"** the authors provide details about the dataset derived from the ZTF survey. They mention that this dataset contains samples from astronomical objects detected at least once, categorized into four classes: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), Supernovae (SNe), Variable Stars (VS), and bogus events. The total number of examples is specified as 168,156.

The authors also describe the preprocessing steps taken for the dataset, which includes discarding alerts with images of incorrect dimensions and normalizing the metadata. This detailed description confirms that the ZTF dataset is central to their research.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ZTF survey, which is crucial for proper documentation. The citation for the Zwicky Transient Facility is:

- **Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)**:
  > F. J. Masci et al., “The Zwicky Transient Facility: Data Processing, Products, and Archive,” *Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific*, vol. 131, p. 018003, Dec 2018.

Additionally, the authors reference the **ALeRCE broker** in their methodology, which processes the ZTF data. I will also include the citation for the ALeRCE broker:

- **ALeRCE Broker**:
  > R. Carrasco-Davis et al., “Alert Classification for the ALeRCE Broker System: The Real-Time Stamp Classifier,” *The Astronomical Journal*, vol. 162, p. 231, Nov 2021.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
