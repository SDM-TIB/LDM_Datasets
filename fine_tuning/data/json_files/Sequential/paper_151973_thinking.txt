To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning to Learn with Multitask Neural Model Search" by Catherine Wong and Andrea Gesmundo, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the tasks and datasets used in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the Multitask Neural Model Search (MNMS) framework and its application to various tasks. They mention that the MNMS framework was applied to two text classification tasks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the tasks and datasets used for training and evaluation:

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: This dataset is used for binary sentiment classification. The authors reference the original work by Socher et al. (2013) for this dataset.

2. **Spanish Language Identification Dataset**: This dataset consists of the 5,000 highest frequency Wikipedia tokens in English, Spanish, German, and Japanese, with binary labels indicating whether the token is Spanish. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, so I will note that it is a custom dataset created for their study.

For the transfer learning experiments, the authors mention two additional datasets:

1. **IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset**: This dataset is used for binary sentiment classification and is cited from Maas et al. (2011).

2. **CorpusCine Dataset**: This dataset consists of Spanish movie reviews and is cited from Cruz et al. (2008).

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing, pp. 1631–1642, 2013.

- For the **IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L Maas, Raymond E Daly, Peter T Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies-Volume 1, pp. 142–150. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2011.

- For the **CorpusCine Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fermín L Cruz, Jose A Troyano, Fernando Enriquez, and Javier Ortega. *Clasificación de documentos basada en la opinión: experimentos con un corpus de críticas de cine en español*. Procesamiento del lenguaje natural, 41:73–80, 2008.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
