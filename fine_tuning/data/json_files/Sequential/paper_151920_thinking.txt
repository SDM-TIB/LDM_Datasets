To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Usage of Autoencoders and Siamese Networks for Online Handwritten Signature Verification" by Kian Ahrabian and Bagher Babaali, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their framework using two datasets: **SigWiComp2013 Japanese** and **GPDSsyntheticOnLineOﬄineSignature**. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 3) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In section 3.1, they describe both datasets:

1. **SigWiComp2013 Japanese**: This dataset consists of signatures from 31 subjects, with 462 genuine and 396 forged signatures in the training set, and 840 genuine and 720 forged signatures in the test set.

2. **GPDSsyntheticOnLineOﬄineSignature**: This dataset includes signatures from 10,000 subjects, with each subject providing 24 genuine and 30 forged signatures. The authors mention using non-intersecting subsets for training and testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **SigWiComp2013 Japanese**, the citation is:
  > Malik, M.I., Liwicki, M., Alewijnse, L., Ohyama, W., Blumenstein, M., Found, B. (2013). *ICDAR 2013 competitions on signature verification and writer identification for on-and offline skilled forgeries (SigWiComp 2013)*. In Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 2013 12th International Conference on, pp. 1477–1483. IEEE.

- For **GPDSsyntheticOnLineOﬄineSignature**, the citation is:
  > Ferrer, M.A., Diaz, M., Carmona-Duarte, C., Morales, A. (2017). *A behavioral handwriting model for static and dynamic signature synthesis*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 39(6), 1041–1053.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that I have accurately captured the details and citations for each dataset as they are critical for proper attribution in any subsequent work.
