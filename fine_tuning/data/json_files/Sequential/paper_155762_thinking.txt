To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coordinating CAV Swarms at Intersections with a Deep Learning Model" by Jiawei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. This section often includes information about the size, characteristics, and purpose of each dataset used in the study. I will look for specific names of datasets and any relevant details that describe their content and usage.

In this paper, the authors mention constructing a dataset Î¨ containing **200,000 problem instances** to train their neural networks. This indicates that there is a dataset specifically created for the experiments, which is crucial to note.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to retrieve the complete citation for each one. For instance, if they reference a dataset from a previous study, I will look for that study in the references to get the full citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will involve clearly stating the name of the dataset, a brief description, and the citation in the appropriate format.

Finally, I will organize all the extracted datasets into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation.
