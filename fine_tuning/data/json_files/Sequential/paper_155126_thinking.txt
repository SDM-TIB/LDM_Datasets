To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Comparative Study of Long Document Classification" by Vedangi Wagh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or alluded to. The abstract indicates that the authors benchmark various algorithms on six standard text classification datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Dataset Details)**, where the authors explicitly list and describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics provided.

The datasets mentioned in this section are:

1. **BBC News**: Contains 2,225 records, classified into 5 categories (Business, Politics, Sport, Entertainment, Tech).
2. **AG News**: A collection of 127,600 records, with articles categorized into 4 categories (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech).
3. **20 Newsgroups (20NG)**: Comprises 18,774 records from 20 different newsgroups, commonly used for text classification and clustering tasks.
4. **BBC Sports**: Contains 737 sports articles, classified into 5 classes (athletics, cricket, football, rugby, tennis).
5. **IMDB**: A dataset of 50,000 movie reviews for binary sentiment classification (positive or negative).
6. **R8**: Part of the Reuters 21578 dataset, containing 7,674 records divided into 8 classes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all datasets are accurately represented and properly cited.
