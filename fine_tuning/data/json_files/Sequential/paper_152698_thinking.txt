To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ShufﬂeNASNets: Efficient CNN models through modified Efficient Neural Architecture Search" by Kevin A. Laube and Andreas Zell, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of ShufﬂeNASNets on CIFAR-10, which suggests that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look closely at **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their evaluation process. Here, they explicitly mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which consists of 60,000 32x32 pixel color images across 10 classes. This section provides details about how the dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets, confirming its use in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech Report, 2009.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the CIFAR-10 dataset for its experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for CIFAR-10, ensuring that it is ready for any further processing or review.
