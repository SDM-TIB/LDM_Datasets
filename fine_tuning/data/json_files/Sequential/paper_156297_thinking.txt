To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comprehensive Overview of Named Entity Recognition: Models, Domain-Specific Applications and Challenges," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and applications sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that are more likely to contain specific dataset information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various methodologies and applications of Named Entity Recognition (NER), but they do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **methodology section**, where the authors describe different NER techniques and models. Here, they reference models like BERT, ViBERTgrid, and BioBERT, but again, no specific datasets are named.

Next, I will examine the **applications section**, which discusses the use of NER in various domains such as finance and biomedicine. While the applications are described in detail, the section does not provide specific datasets either.

However, in the **references section**, I will look for any citations that may indicate datasets used in the studies referenced throughout the paper. For instance, the authors mention several models and techniques that may have associated datasets in their respective original papers.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the following datasets mentioned in the context of NER:

1. **ACE 2004 Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for evaluating NER systems, particularly in the context of nested entity recognition. The citation for this dataset is:
   > D. M. Bikel, R. Schwartz, and R. M. Weischedel. *An algorithm that learns what's in a name*. Machine Learning, 34(1-3):211-231, 1999.

2. **GENIA Dataset**: This dataset is widely used in biomedical NER tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > K. Takeda, Y. Ohta, and J. Tsujii. *The GENIA corpus: An annotated corpus for bio-text mining*. In Proceedings of the 2nd International Symposium on Language and Data, 2002.

3. **Multi-Layout Invoice Document Dataset (MID)**: This dataset is specifically designed for named entity recognition in invoice documents. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Dipali Baviskar, Swati Ahirrao, and Ketan Kotecha. *Multi-layout invoice document dataset (midd): a dataset for named entity recognition*. Data, 6(7):78, 2021.

4. **Distantly Supervised NER Dataset**: This dataset is generated through distant supervision techniques and is referenced in the context of enhancing NER performance. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Yaosheng Yang, Wenliang Chen, Zhenghua Li, Zhengqiu He, and Min Zhang. *Distantly supervised ner with partial annotation learning and reinforcement learning*. In Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pages 2159â€“2169, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that each dataset is accurately documented with its full citation, which is crucial for any subsequent analysis or reference.
