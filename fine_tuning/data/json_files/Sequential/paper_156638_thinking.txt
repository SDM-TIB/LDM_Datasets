To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Efficient Resume Understanding: A Multi-Granularity Multi-Modal Pre-Training Approach" by Feihu Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on a real-world dataset, which suggests that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. They mention that they collected unlabeled resumes for pre-training and annotated a dataset for fine-tuning and testing. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a summary table (Table I) that includes statistics about the datasets. They mention:

1. **Pre-training Documents**: 169,286 resumes with an average of 88.90 segments per document.
2. **Fine-tune Documents**: 
   - Training: 196 resumes
   - Validation: 100 resumes
   - Test: 141 resumes

However, the specific names of the datasets are not provided in the text. I will need to check the **References section** for any citations that might refer to the datasets used for pre-training or fine-tuning.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that there are no specific dataset citations listed. This indicates that the datasets may be proprietary or not publicly available, which is common in industry-focused research.

Since the authors did not provide full citations for the datasets, I will note that the datasets are described in terms of their characteristics (e.g., number of resumes, average segments, etc.) but lack formal citations.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to highlight the absence of formal citations for the datasets used in the study.

In summary, I will document the datasets as follows:

1. **Dataset for Pre-training**: Unlabeled resumes (169,286 documents).
2. **Dataset for Fine-tuning**: 
   - Training: 196 resumes
   - Validation: 100 resumes
   - Test: 141 resumes

Since there are no formal citations available for these datasets, I will indicate that they are not publicly cited in the paper.

This structured approach ensures that I have thoroughly examined the paper for dataset information and documented it accurately, even in the absence of formal citations.
