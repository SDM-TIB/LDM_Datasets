To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Multimodal Neural Architecture Search" by Zhou Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on five commonly used benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **VQA-v2**: This dataset is used for the visual question answering task and contains human-annotated question-answer pairs for COCO images. The authors provide details about the dataset's splits: train (80k images with 444k questions), val (40k images with 214k questions), and test (80k images with 448k questions).

2. **Flickr30K**: This dataset consists of 31,000 images collected from the Flickr website, each with five captions. The authors specify the partition strategy used for validation and testing.

3. **RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg**: These three datasets are utilized for evaluating visual grounding performance. The authors provide details about the splits for each dataset, including the number of queries for training, validation, and testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **VQA-v2**, the citation is:
  > Yash Goyal, Tejas Khot, Douglas Summers-Stay, Dhruv Batra, and Devi Parikh. *Making the V in VQA Matter: Elevating the Role of Image Understanding in Visual Question Answering*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

- For **Flickr30K**, the citation is:
  > Bryan A Plummer, Liwei Wang, Chris M Cervantes, Juan C Caicedo, Julia Hockenmaier, and Svetlana Lazebnik. *Flickr30K Entities: Collecting Region-to-Phrase Correspondences for Richer Image-to-Sentence Models*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

- For **RefCOCO**, **RefCOCO+**, and **RefCOCOg**, the citation is:
  > Sahar Kazemzadeh, Vicente Ordonez, Mark Matten, and Tamara Berg. *ReferItGame: Referring to Objects in Photographs of Natural Scenes*. In Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2014.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
