To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Clinical Concept Extraction with Contextual Embeddings" by Yuqi Si et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions evaluating various embedding methods on four concept extraction corpora, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will take note of the specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets and Experiments)**, as this section is likely to provide detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors list four datasets:

1. **i2b2 2010**: This dataset contains 349 training notes and 477 testing notes, with a total of 27,837 entities annotated.
2. **i2b2 2012**: This dataset includes 190 training notes and 120 testing notes, with 16,468 entities.
3. **SemEval 2014 Task 7**: This dataset has 199 training notes and 99 testing notes, with 5,816 entities.
4. **SemEval 2015 Task 14**: This dataset consists of 298 training notes and 133 testing notes, with 11,167 entities.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **i2b2 2010**:

- For **SemEval 2014 Task 7**:
  > Pradhan, S., Elhadad, N., Chapman, W., Manandhar, S., & Savova, G. (2014). Semeval-2014 task 7: Analysis of clinical text. In *Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2014)*, 54-62.

- For **SemEval 2015 Task 14**:
  > Elhadad, N., Pradhan, S., Gorman, S., Manandhar, S., & Savova, G. (2015). Semeval-2015 task 14: Analysis of clinical text. In *Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2015)*, 303-310.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or integration into other systems.
