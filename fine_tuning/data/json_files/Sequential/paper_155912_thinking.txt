To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning for UAV Propeller Fault Detection based on a Hybrid Data Generation Model" by J. J. Tonga et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the development of a data-driven system for monitoring and localizing faults in UAVs, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction discusses the need for a robust fault detection system and hints at the use of flight datasets under normal and fault conditions.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any relevant subsections that might provide explicit details about the datasets used. In this paper, the authors describe a **hybrid data generation model** that simulates flight data under various conditions. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned in this context.

In the **Methods** section, particularly under the **Data-generative UAV model** and **CNN-based fault classifier**, the authors outline how they generate datasets through simulations. They mention generating datasets under 16 labeled categories, which represent different fault scenarios for the UAV propellers. I will note the parameters used for these datasets, such as target RPMs, roll, pitch, yaw, and other flight dynamics.

The **Experiments and Results** section will also be crucial, as it may provide insights into the datasets used for training and testing the models. The authors describe the collection of datasets from flight runs in both simulation and real-world scenarios, which will be important for citation.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to datasets generated through simulations and real-world tests, but they do not provide specific external dataset citations. Instead, they describe their own generated datasets based on their experiments.

1. **Simulated Flight Datasets**: These datasets are generated using a hybrid data generation model that simulates UAV flight under normal and fault conditions. The authors do not provide a formal citation for these datasets since they are original to this study.

2. **Real-World Flight Datasets**: The authors conducted real-flight tests to validate their model, but again, they do not cite any external datasets. The datasets collected during these tests are also original to this study.

Since the datasets are primarily generated by the authors and do not reference existing datasets, I will note that the citations for these datasets will be based on the paper itself.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format the dataset entries according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the relevant details and citations for the datasets as described in the paper.
