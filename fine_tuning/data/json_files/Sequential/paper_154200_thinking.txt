To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conversational Semantic Parsing" by Armen Aghajanyan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors released a new dataset of 20k sessions consisting of 60k utterances, which suggests that this dataset is significant and likely to be detailed further in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 4.1**, they explicitly mention the release of the **SB-TOP dataset**, which consists of 20,000 annotated sessions across four domains: calling, weather, music, and reminders. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's purpose and structure.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. In **section 4.2**, the authors refer to several other datasets used for evaluation, including:

1. **TOP Dataset**: This dataset contains over 31,000 training utterances covering various domains such as navigation and events.
2. **SNIPS Natural Language Understanding Benchmark**: A well-known dataset for natural language understanding tasks.
3. **Airline Travel Information Systems (ATIS) Dataset**: A classic dataset used for evaluating semantic parsing and intent recognition.

In **section 4.3**, the authors mention the **DSTC2 dataset**, which contains dialogues annotated with dialogue states, further confirming its relevance to their work.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **SB-TOP dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
