To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Term Prediction Of Neural Activity Using LSTM With Multiple Temporal Resolution" by Yilin Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the prediction of neural activity and mentions using a specific type of data, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention analyzing **µECoG data from an acute in vivo feline model of seizures**. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of electrodes, the temporal sampling rate, and the total number of frames recorded.

The dataset description includes:
- **µECoG Dataset**: This dataset consists of recordings from an 18 by 20 array of high-density active electrodes with 500 µm spacing, recorded at a temporal sampling rate of 277.78 Hz over a duration of 53 minutes, resulting in a total of 894K frames (788K training frames and 106K testing frames).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from a specific experimental setup rather than a publicly available dataset with a formal citation, I will note that the dataset is based on the authors' own experimental data.

The citation for the paper itself is:
> Yilin Song, Ran Wang, Yao Wang, and Jonathan Viventi. *Long Term Prediction Of Neural Activity Using LSTM With Multiple Temporal Resolution*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC), 2023.

Since the dataset is not formally published, I will document it as follows:
- **µECoG Dataset**: Data collected from an acute in vivo feline model of seizures, recorded using a high-density electrode array.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the citation for the paper as the source of the dataset information. This will allow for proper attribution and reference in any future work or analysis.
