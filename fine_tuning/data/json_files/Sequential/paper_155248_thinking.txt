To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Churn prediction in online gambling" by Merchie Florian and Ernst Damiena, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of online gambling data for churn prediction, which suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find specific details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of data sources in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors mention that the data was collected from **Gaming1**, a Belgian online gambling company, and that it consists of the activity history of **10,000 gambling players** from January 1, 2017, to June 1, 2021. This indicates that there is a specific dataset being used.

I will also check for any **tables or figures** that summarize the dataset characteristics. In the paper, there is a table (Table 5.1) that lists the features aggregated from transactional logs, which provides insight into the dataset's structure. The features include various metrics related to player activity, such as the number of casino plays, gross gaming revenue, and the number of deposits and withdrawals.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from the activities of players at Gaming1, I will cite it as follows:

- **Gaming1 Dataset**: 
  > Merchie, F., & Ernst, D. (2023). Churn prediction in online gambling. *Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, ULi√®ge; LTCI, Telecom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris*. Retrieved from [insert URL if available].

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including its description and citation, into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset used in the research paper.
