To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prediction of Time and Distance of Trips Using Explainable Attention-Based LSTMs" by Ebrahim Balouji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors developed a framework for predicting trip time and distance using a dataset collected from 700 GPS-tracked vehicles in Sweden. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to gather more specific details.

Next, I will look into **section 2.1 (Data and preprocessing)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of **95,962 trips** collected from **700 vehicles**. They also explain the preprocessing steps taken, such as discarding trips shorter than 3 km and combining trips made within 10 minutes to avoid GPS disconnection. This section provides a clear description of the dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. The authors refer to a previous work for more details about the trips, specifically citing a technical report by Sten Karlsson from Chalmers University of Technology. The citation is as follows:

- For the dataset, the citation is:
  > Sten Karlsson. *The Swedish Car Movement Data Project Final Report*. Technical report, Chalmers University of Technology, 2013.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Swedish Car Movement Dataset
   - **Description**: A real-world dataset containing 95,962 trips collected from 700 GPS-tracked vehicles in Sweden. The dataset was filtered to exclude trips shorter than 3 km and to combine trips made within 10 minutes.
   - **Full Citation**: Sten Karlsson. *The Swedish Car Movement Data Project Final Report*. Technical report, Chalmers University of Technology, 2013.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their citations from the research paper.
