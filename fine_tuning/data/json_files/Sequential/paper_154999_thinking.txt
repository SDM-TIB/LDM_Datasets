To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Paraphrase Generation as Unsupervised Machine Translation" by Xiaofei Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on existing paraphrase datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **Quora Dataset**: This dataset contains 140K parallel paraphrases of questions and 260K non-parallel sentences collected from the question-answering website Quora. The authors follow a standard setup for validation and testing.

2. **WikiAnswers Dataset**: This corpus contains clusters of questions tagged by WikiAnswers users as paraphrases, totaling 2.3 million paraphrase pairs. The authors specify their approach to validation and testing.

3. **MSCOCO Dataset**: This dataset includes over 500K paraphrase pairs for 120K image captions, with annotations from five different annotators. The authors reference a specific evaluation protocol for this dataset.

4. **Twitter Dataset**: Collected via linked tweets through shared URLs, this dataset originally contains 50K paraphrase pairs. The authors describe how they split the data for validation and testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Quora Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Quora. *Quora Question Pairs*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs.

- For the **WikiAnswers Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fader, A., Zettlemoyer, L., & Etzioni, O. (2013). *Paraphrase-driven learning for open question answering*. In Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1608–1618.

- For the **MSCOCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755.

- For the **Twitter Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lan, W., Qiu, W., He, H., & Xu, W. (2017). *A continuously growing dataset of sentential paraphrases*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1224–1234.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details from the paper regarding the datasets used in the research.
