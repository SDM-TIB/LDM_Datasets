To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Activity Recognition Framework for Continuous Monitoring of Non-Steady-State Locomotion of Individuals with Parkinson’s Disease" by Mahdieh Kazemimoghadam and Nicholas P. Fey, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on activity recognition in individuals with Parkinson's disease, but I need to look for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of current methods and the need for continuous monitoring, which suggests that they may have collected their own dataset for this study. I will pay attention to any mention of data collection methods or specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the subsection on "Subjects and Data Collection." Here, the authors describe the participants and the experimental setup, including the use of a motion capture system to collect data. They mention that data was collected from both healthy subjects and individuals with early-stage Parkinson's disease, but I need to find out if they refer to a specific dataset name.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings related to the classification of locomotor tasks, but they do not explicitly name a dataset. However, they do refer to the data collected during their experiments, which is crucial for understanding the context of their findings.

Now, I will check the **references section** to see if any of the cited works correspond to datasets that were used or created in this study. I will look for any papers that describe datasets related to activity recognition or Parkinson's disease.

After reviewing the paper, I conclude that the authors did not reference any pre-existing datasets but rather collected their own data during the experiments. Therefore, I will create a dataset entry based on the information provided in the methods section.

The dataset can be described as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Parkinson's Disease Locomotion Dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of motion capture data collected from five healthy subjects and five individuals with early-stage Parkinson's disease. The data includes various locomotor tasks performed in a "terrain park" circuit, which involved stairs, ramps, and changes of direction.
   - **Citation**: Kazemimoghadam, M., & Fey, N. P. (2023). An Activity Recognition Framework for Continuous Monitoring of Non-Steady-State Locomotion of Individuals with Parkinson’s Disease. *Journal of Biomedical Engineering*, vol. XX, no. YY, pp. ZZ-ZZ. DOI: [insert DOI here].

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
