To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Synthesizing Audio from Silent Video using Sequence to Sequence Modeling" by Hugo Garrido-Lestache Belinchon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the model is trained on the **Youtube8M dataset**, which is a significant indicator that this dataset is central to the research. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset's relevance and its application in the study.

Next, I will look at the **Dataset section** of the paper, which provides a detailed description of the **Youtube8M dataset**. Here, the authors describe it as a manually annotated dataset containing over 6.1 million videos and covering 3862 different classes. They specifically focus on the "Airplane" class, which contains 35,170 videos. This section confirms the dataset's importance and provides specific details about its content and the rationale for its selection.

After identifying the dataset, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Youtube8M dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Abu-El-Haija, S., Kothari, N., Lee, J., Natsev, P., Toderici, G., Varadarajan, B., & Vijayanarasimhan, S. (2016). YouTube-8M: A Large-Scale Video Classification Benchmark. Google Research.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will ensure that I accurately document its details and citation.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring that it is ready for further processing or review.
