To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Self-Tuning Actor-Critic Algorithm" by Tom Zahavy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors applied their algorithm to the **Arcade Learning Environment** and the **DM Control suite**, indicating that these environments may contain datasets relevant to their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experiments in detail. They mention using the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)** and the **DM Control suite** for their evaluations. I will check if there are any specific datasets or benchmarks within these environments that are referenced.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not specify individual datasets within the ALE or DM Control suite, but they do reference the environments themselves. Therefore, I will document these environments as datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these environments from the references section:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**:
   - Citation:
     > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. "The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents." *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

2. **DM Control suite**:
   - Citation:
     > Tassa, Y., Doron, Y., Muldal, A., Erez, T., Li, Y., Casas, D. d. L., Budden, D., Abdolmaleki, A., Merel, J., Lefrancq, A., et al. "Deepmind control suite." *arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690*, 2018.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)
- DM Control suite

I will ensure to include the full citations for both datasets as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work or analysis.
