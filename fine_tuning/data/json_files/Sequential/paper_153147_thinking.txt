To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Learning Universal, Regional, and Local Hydrological Behaviors via Machine-Learning Applied to Large-Sample Datasets" by Frederik Kratzert et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a dataset called **CAMELS** for their experiments, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods section**, particularly in subsection 2.4, where the authors describe the **NCAR CAMELS Dataset**. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of data from **671 basins**, and they specifically used a subset of **531 basins** for their analysis. This section provides important details about the dataset's characteristics and its relevance to the study.

In the **results section**, the authors benchmark their model against several existing hydrological models, which further confirms the use of the CAMELS dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CAMELS dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **CAMELS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Addor, N., Newman, A. J., Mizukami, N., and Clark, M. P. (2017). The CAMELS data set: Catchment attributes and meteorology for large-sample studies. *Hydrology and Earth System Sciences*, 21, 5293–5313. https://doi.org/10.5065/D6G73C3Q.

Since the authors also mention using meteorological time series data from the **Maurer forcings**, I will look for its citation as well. The citation for the Maurer dataset is:

- For the **Maurer forcings**, the citation is:
  > Wood, A. W., Maurer, E. P., Kumar, A., and Lettenmaier, D. P. (2002). Long-range experimental hydrologic forecasting for the eastern United States. *Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres*, 107, ACL–6. https://doi.org/10.1029/2001JD000659.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the study.
