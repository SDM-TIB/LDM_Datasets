To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Belief Tree Search for Active Object Recognition" by Mohsen Malmir and Garrison W. Cottrell, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset called **GERMS**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is significant to the research.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of the dataset in the **results section**. Here, the authors provide specific information about the **GERMS dataset**, stating that it contains approximately 120,000 images of 136 different objects collected by a robot. The dataset is noted for its challenge in object recognition due to the need for fine categorization based on small visual cues.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the GERMS dataset. However, the paper does not provide a separate citation for the GERMS dataset, as it appears to be a dataset created by the authors themselves. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is referenced in the context of the authors' own work.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **GERMS Dataset**: This dataset is described as a medium-sized dataset with approximately 120,000 images of 136 different objects. The images were collected by a robot that examines each object from multiple orientations. The dataset is specifically designed for active object recognition tasks.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the GERMS dataset, I will document it as follows:

- **GERMS Dataset**: 
  > Malmir, M., & Cottrell, G. W. (2016). Deep active object recognition by joint label and action prediction. *Computer Vision and Image Understanding*. 

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that the dataset's significance and details are well documented.
