To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Anisotropic Hybrid Network: Transferring Convolutional Features from 2D Images to 3D Anisotropic Volumes" by Siqi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find two datasets mentioned:

1. **Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) Dataset**: The authors state that they used an in-house database containing 2809 3D DBT volumes acquired from 12 different sites globally. This dataset is crucial for their lesion detection experiments.

2. **Liver Lesion Segmentation Challenge Dataset**: The second dataset is from the liver lesion segmentation challenge in MICCAI 2017, which consists of 131 training and 70 testing 3D contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scans. This dataset is used for liver and liver tumor segmentation tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the DBT dataset is in-house and does not have a formal citation, I will note that. For the liver lesion segmentation challenge dataset, I will look for the original source or challenge website.

The citation for the liver lesion segmentation challenge dataset is:
> MICCAI 2017 Liver Lesion Segmentation Challenge. Available at: [lits-challenge.com](http://lits-challenge.com).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) Dataset**: In-house dataset with 2809 3D volumes from 12 sites. No formal citation available.
2. **Liver Lesion Segmentation Challenge Dataset**: 131 training and 70 testing 3D CT scans. Citation: MICCAI 2017 Liver Lesion Segmentation Challenge. Available at: [lits-challenge.com](http://lits-challenge.com).

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entries for further processing or documentation.
