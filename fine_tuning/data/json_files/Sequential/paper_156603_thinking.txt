To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Individual Graph Structures to Enhance Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) Forecasting" by Mandani Ntekouli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on EMA data, which suggests that there may be a specific dataset used for analysis.

Next, I will examine **section IV (EMA Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of real-world EMA pilot data collected from 269 participants over 28 days, with each participant completing 8 questionnaires per day. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's structure and the nature of the data collected.

The authors specify that the EMA data is structured as multivariate time-series data, which is essential for understanding the dataset's application in their research. They also mention that after pre-processing, a group of 100 individuals remained for analysis, and all were represented by the same subset of 26 variables.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to their dataset as part of a project supported by the Dutch Research Council and the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. However, they do not provide a specific citation for the EMA dataset itself, as it appears to be original data collected for this study.

Since the dataset is not published elsewhere, I will note that the citation for the dataset is as follows:
> Ntekouli, M., Spanakis, G., Waldorp, L., & Roefs, A. (2023). *Exploiting Individual Graph Structures to Enhance Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) Forecasting*. Unpublished dataset.

In summary, I will create an entry for the EMA dataset, ensuring to include the details about its structure and the context of its use in the research. This will be crucial for any future references or analyses involving this dataset.
