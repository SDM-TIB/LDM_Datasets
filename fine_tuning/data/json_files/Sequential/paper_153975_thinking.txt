To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learn to cycle: Time-consistent feature discovery for action recognition" by Alexandros Stergiou and Ronald Poppe, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in action recognition and mention the use of various datasets for evaluation. This indicates that datasets are likely to be detailed in the experiments section.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention five action recognition datasets:

1. **HACS (Human Action Clips and Segments)**: This dataset includes approximately 500K clips of 200 classes, with clips being 60-frame segments extracted from 50k unique videos.

2. **Kinetics-700 (K-700)**: An extension of the Kinetics-400/600 datasets, it contains around 600k clips of varying durations across 700 classes.

3. **Moments in Time (MiT)**: One of the largest video datasets for human actions, it includes 339 classes with approximately 800K clips, each lasting 3 seconds.

4. **UCF-101**: This dataset consists of 101 classes and 13k clips, with durations varying between 2 and 14 seconds.

5. **HMDB-51**: Contains 7K clips divided over 51 classes, with at least 101 clips per class.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **HACS**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
