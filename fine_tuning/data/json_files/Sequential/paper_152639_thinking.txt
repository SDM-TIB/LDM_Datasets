To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reconstructing Speech Stimuli From Human Auditory Cortex Activity Using a WaveNet-like Network" by Ran Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study involves reconstructing speech stimuli from ECoG recordings, which suggests that there are datasets related to these recordings.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology** section, particularly the **Data Acquisition** subsection, where the authors describe how they collected ECoG data from two subjects. They mention that they recorded brain activities while the subjects listened to 50 different English words. This section provides crucial details about the datasets used in the study.

In the **experiments** section, the authors discuss how they separated the datasets into training and testing sets for cross-validation. They specify the number of training sequences for each subject, which further confirms the existence of two distinct datasets.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Dataset for Subject S1**: This dataset consists of ECoG recordings from the first subject (S1) who passively listened to 50 English words. The dataset includes 17,000 training sequences, with each word repeated twice.

2. **Dataset for Subject S2**: This dataset consists of ECoG recordings from the second subject (S2), who participated in two tasks involving the same 50 words. The dataset includes 26,000 training sequences, with each word repeated three times.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, the datasets in this paper are original and specific to the study, so they may not have external citations. Instead, I will note that the datasets are derived from the authors' own recordings during the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the context of how they were collected and their significance in the study. Each dataset will be clearly labeled with its corresponding subject and details about the recordings.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that the citations and descriptions are accurate and comprehensive.
