To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A LSTM and Cost-Sensitive Learning-Based Real-Time Warning for Civil Aviation Over-limit" by Yiming Bian, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the model is trained on a "real dataset," which suggests that there is a dataset used for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** where the author discusses the dataset used. The paper states that the dataset consists of QAR (Quick Access Record) data from eight flights, containing about 205,000 samples and 60 attributes. This is a clear identification of the dataset used in the study.

I will also look for any specific details about the dataset, such as how it was processed or any relevant characteristics. The paper mentions that the dataset records flight parameters of passenger aircraft during the flight, and it describes the preprocessing steps taken, including converting text labels to numeric values and adjusting the sampling frequency.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset appears to be a proprietary or specific dataset used in the study (QAR data from eight flights), it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. In this case, I will note that the dataset is derived from QAR data but may not have a formal citation.

To summarize, I will document the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: QAR Data
   - **Description**: The dataset consists of QAR data from eight flights, containing approximately 205,000 samples and 60 attributes, recording various flight parameters during the flights.
   - **Citation**: Not formally cited; derived from QAR data used in the study.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant details about the dataset used in the research paper.
