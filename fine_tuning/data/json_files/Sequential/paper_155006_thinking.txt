To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Neural Text Simplification to Improve Downstream NLP Tasks" by Hoang Van, Zheng Tang, and Mihai Surdeanu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two datasets: **TACRED** and **MNLI**. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **TACRED Dataset**: This is described as a large-scale relation extraction dataset with 106,264 examples built on newswire and web text. The dataset is noted for its complexity, requiring critical information preservation.

2. **MNLI Dataset**: This dataset is a crowd-sourced collection of 433K sentence pairs annotated for natural language inference. Each data point consists of a premise-hypothesis pair with one of three labels: contradiction, entailment, or neutral.

To confirm the details about these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **TACRED**, the citation is:
  > Yuhao Zhang, Victor Zhong, Danqi Chen, Gabor Angeli, and Christopher D Manning. *Position-aware attention and supervised data improve slot filling*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 35â€“45, 2017.

- For **MNLI**, the citation is:
  > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel R Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.05426, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
