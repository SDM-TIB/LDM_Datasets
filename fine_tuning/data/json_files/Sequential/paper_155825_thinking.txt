To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CKG: Dynamic Representation Based on Context and Knowledge Graph" by Xunzhu Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on a wide range of tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors detail the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly mention several datasets:

1. **Quora Question Pairs (QQP)**: This dataset is described as a binary classification task including 400,000 question pairs, where the goal is to determine if two questions are equivalent.

2. **Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC)**: This dataset consists of sentence pairs extracted from online news sources, annotated for semantic equivalence.

3. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-5)**: This dataset is a binary single-sentence classification task from movie reviews, containing five levels of sentiment.

4. **Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD v1.1)**: This dataset consists of questions based on a set of Wikipedia articles, where each question is paired with a passage containing the answer.

5. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: This dataset includes English and German news articles, with entities annotated for various categories.

6. **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI)**: This dataset involves pairs of sentences where the task is to predict the relationship between them (entailment, contradiction, or neutral).

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details from the paper regarding the datasets used in the research.
