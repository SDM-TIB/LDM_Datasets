To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parametric Resynthesis with Neural Vocoders" by Soumi Maiti and Michael I. Mandel, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of neural vocoders for noise suppression and mentions the LJSpeech dataset, which is a key dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section, where the authors may provide additional context or mention other datasets. Here, I will look for any references to datasets used in their previous work or in the context of their proposed methods.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, I will focus on the details provided about the datasets. The authors explicitly mention using the **LJSpeech dataset** and the **CHiME-3 dataset**. I will take note of the specifics regarding these datasets, such as their size, content, and any preprocessing steps mentioned.

1. **LJSpeech Dataset**: The paper describes it as containing 13,100 audio clips from a single speaker, with varying lengths and a sampling rate of 22 kHz. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **CHiME-3 Dataset**: This dataset includes environmental noise types (street, bus, pedestrian, and cafe) that were mixed with the LJSpeech dataset to create noisy speech samples. The authors provide details about the SNR levels and the process of mixing the noise with the clean speech.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. 

- For the **LJSpeech dataset**, the citation is:
  > Keith Ito. *The LJ Speech Dataset*. 2017. Available at: https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/.

- For the **CHiME-3 dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Barker, R. Marxer, E. Vincent, and S. Watanabe. “The third CHiME speech separation and recognition challenge: Dataset, task and baselines.” In Proceedings of ASRU, 2015, pp. 504–511.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the descriptions. This will prepare me for the next step of structuring the data for further processing or review.
