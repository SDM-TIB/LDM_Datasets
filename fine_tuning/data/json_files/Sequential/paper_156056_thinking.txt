To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EMF Exposure Mitigation in RIS-Assisted Multi-Beam Communications" by Herman L. dos Santos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research. I will look for any references to datasets or benchmarks that the authors may have used.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets utilized for simulations or evaluations. I will pay close attention to any specific names of datasets mentioned, as well as any relevant details about their characteristics or how they were used in the study.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets that are referenced in the paper. This is crucial, as it allows me to provide accurate and complete citations for each dataset.

As I read through the paper, I will take notes on the following aspects for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The exact title or designation used by the authors.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including the type of data, number of samples, and any relevant features.
3. **Citation**: The full reference for the dataset as provided in the references section of the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the name, description, and citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the final output is comprehensive and accurate.

Finally, I will format the dataset information according to the required structure, ready for further processing or review.
