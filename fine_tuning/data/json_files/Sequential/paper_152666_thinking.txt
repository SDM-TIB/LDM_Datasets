To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relational Long Short-Term Memory for Video Action Recognition" by Zexi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **UCF-101**, **HMDB-51**, and **Charades** datasets, which suggests that these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **UCF-101 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 13,320 short video clips across 101 action classes. It is a well-known benchmark for action recognition tasks.

2. **HMDB-51 Dataset**: This dataset contains 6,766 short video clips categorized into 51 action classes. It is another widely used dataset in the field of action recognition.

3. **Charades Dataset**: This dataset includes 9,848 videos of daily activities with 157 action classes. It is noted for its complexity, as it features longer video durations and multiple actions occurring simultaneously.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **UCF-101 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > K. Soomro, A. R. Zamir, M. Shah. *A dataset of 101 human action classes from videos in the wild*. Center for Research in Computer Vision.

- For the **HMDB-51 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Kuehne, H. Jhuang, E. Garrote, T. Poggio, T. Serre. *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2556–2563, 2011.

- For the **Charades Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. A. Sigurdsson, G. Varol, X. Wang, A. Farhadi, I. Laptev. *Hollywood in homes: Crowdsourcing data collection for activity understanding*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 510–526, 2016.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
