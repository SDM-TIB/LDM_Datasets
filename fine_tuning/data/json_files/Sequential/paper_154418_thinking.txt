To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Iterative Back-Translation from the Perspective of Compositional Generalization" by Yinuo Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on compositional generalization benchmarks, specifically mentioning **CFQ** and **SCAN**. This suggests that these datasets are significant to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 2.1 (Compositional Generalization Benchmarks)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **SCAN**: This dataset consists of natural language commands paired with action sequences. The authors describe various tasks within SCAN, such as ADD JUMP and LENGTH, which are used to assess compositional generalization.

2. **CFQ (Complex Freebase Questions)**: This benchmark includes natural language questions paired with SPARQL queries against the Freebase knowledge graph. The authors explain how the dataset is structured to measure compositional generalization effectively.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they conducted experiments on both the **SCAN** and **CFQ** datasets, reinforcing their importance in the study.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SCAN**, the citation is:
  > Lake, B. & Baroni, M. (2018). Generalization without systematicity: On the compositional skills of sequence-to-sequence recurrent networks. In International Conference on Machine Learning, 2873–2882.

- For **CFQ**, the citation is:
  > Keysers, D., Schärli, N., Scales, N., Buisman, H., Furrer, D., Kashubin, S., Momchev, N., Sinopalnikov, D., Stafiak, L., Tihon, T., Tsarkov, D., Wang, X., van Zee, M., & Bousquet, O. (2020). Measuring Compositional Generalization: A Comprehensive Method on Realistic Data. In International Conference on Learning Representations. URL: https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygcCnNKwr.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and thoroughness in the extraction process.
