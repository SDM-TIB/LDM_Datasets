To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hierarchical Model of Reviews for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis" by Sebastian Ruder et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved results on five multilingual, multi-domain datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in their research. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of aspect-based sentiment analysis, hinting at the datasets' relevance.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they utilized datasets from the SemEval-2016 Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis task, which includes datasets across five domains (restaurants, hotels, laptops, phones, cameras) and eight languages (English, Spanish, French, Russian, Dutch, Turkish, Arabic, Chinese). They specify that there are 11 domain-language datasets, each containing between 300-400 reviews and 1250-6000 sentences.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will look for any specific dataset names or identifiers mentioned in this section. The authors refer to the datasets collectively as part of the SemEval-2016 task, but I need to confirm if they provide specific citations or references for these datasets.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SemEval-2016 task, which is crucial for proper attribution. The relevant citation is:

- For the SemEval-2016 Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis task:

In Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, San Diego, California. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2016.

Now, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **SemEval-2016 Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis Datasets**: This includes datasets from various domains and languages, specifically designed for the task of aspect-based sentiment analysis.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is properly cited and described, ready for further processing or review.
