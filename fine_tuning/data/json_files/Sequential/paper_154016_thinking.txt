To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Evoked Potential-Guided Deep Learning Brain Representation For Visual Classification" by Xianglin Zheng, Zehong Cao, and Quan Bai, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves EEG recordings from subjects viewing an image dataset with 6 categories and 72 exemplars, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (The Experiment)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. In this section, they describe the image dataset as containing a total of 72 photographs across 6 categories: Human Body (HB), Human Face (HF), Animal Body (AB), Animal Face (AF), Fruit Vegetable (FV), and Inanimate Object (IO). This section confirms the existence of a dataset and provides a brief overview of its structure.

I will also look for any additional details about the dataset, such as how it was collected or any specific characteristics. The authors mention that EEG signals were recorded from 10 subjects while they viewed these images, which adds context to the dataset's use.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, in this case, the dataset itself (the image dataset) does not have a specific citation provided in the references, as it appears to be an original dataset created for the study.

Since the dataset is described in detail but lacks a formal citation, I will note that the dataset is referred to as the "image dataset" used in the experiments, and I will include the authors and the title of the paper as the source of this dataset information.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and the citation for the paper itself, which serves as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the paper is:
> Xianglin Zheng, Zehong Cao, and Quan Bai. *An Evoked Potential-Guided Deep Learning Brain Representation For Visual Classification*. In Proceedings of the [Conference/Journal Name], [Volume], [Pages], [Year].

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on this information.
