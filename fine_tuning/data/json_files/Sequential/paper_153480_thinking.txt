To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Subword Level Language Model for Bangla Language" by Aisha Khatun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and corpus sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the model is trained on a corpus of Bangla newspaper articles, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Corpus)**, where the authors provide detailed statistics about the dataset they created. They describe it as a large corpus of Bangla newspaper articles, containing over 28.5 million word tokens and a unique word count of 836,509. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including its size and composition.

The authors also mention that the dataset is imbalanced and provide a breakdown of the categories and their respective sample sizes. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and potential applications.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is created by the authors themselves, I will note that the citation will refer to the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Aisha Khatun, Anisur Rahman, Hemayet Ahmed Chowdhury, Md. Saiful Islam, and Ayesha Tasnim. *A Subword Level Language Model for Bangla Language*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Since the exact conference name and year are not provided in the text, I will leave placeholders for these details.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the dataset information from the paper.
