To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Thermal Infrared Image Inpainting via Edge-Aware Guidance" by Zeyu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **FLIR thermal dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they mention the **FLIR thermal dataset**, specifying that it consists of **8862 training images and 1366 testing images**. They also describe how the images are processed for training and testing, which is important for understanding the dataset's application.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference the FLIR thermal dataset as follows:

- **FLIR thermal dataset**: 
  > F.A. Group, “FLIR thermal dataset for algorithm training,” https://www.flir.co.uk/oem/adas/adas-dataset-form/, 2019.

This citation provides the necessary details to reference the dataset properly.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **FLIR thermal dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method, consisting of 8862 training images and 1366 testing images. The authors describe the preprocessing steps for these images, which are essential for their experiments.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or documentation.
