To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How hard is it to cross the room? Training (Recurrent) Neural Networks to steer a UAV" by Klaas Kelchtermans and Tinne Tuytelaars, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "proof of concept" involving a UAV in a simulated environment, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this simulation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Method)**, particularly **subsection 4.4 (The Room Crossing datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **Room Crossing One Dataset**: This dataset consists of RGB images captured from a drone flying through a simulated environment. The authors describe how the dataset includes various obstacles and different training trajectories.

2. **Room Crossing Two Dataset**: This dataset is described as more challenging and is also composed of RGB images from a drone in a simulated environment. The authors note that this dataset is intentionally kept small to better represent a real-world imitation learning scenario.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors indicate that the datasets will be shared after publication, but they do not provide specific citations for them in the references. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are original contributions of the authors and will be available for future use.

Finally, I will summarize the findings for each dataset, ensuring to include the relevant details such as the nature of the data, the context in which it was collected, and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key information about each dataset, ready for further processing or review.
