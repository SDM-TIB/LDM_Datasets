To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Point-less: More Abstractive Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks" by Freek Boutkan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses improvements to the Pointer-Generator architecture but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly **section 3 (Methods)**, where the authors describe their dataset.

In **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, the authors state that they use the **CNN Dailymail dataset**. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of training pairs, validation pairs, and test examples, as well as the average lengths of articles and summaries. This section confirms that the CNN Dailymail dataset is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CNN Dailymail dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **CNN Dailymail dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), pages 1693â€“1701, 2015.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CNN Dailymail Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 287,000 training pairs, 13,000 validation pairs, and 11,000 test examples. The average article length is 781 tokens, and the average summary length is 56 tokens.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry for the CNN Dailymail dataset, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution. This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the dataset used in the research paper.
