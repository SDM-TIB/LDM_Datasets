To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Code Failure Prediction and Pattern Extraction using LSTM Networks" by Mahdi Hajiaghayi and Ehsan Vahedi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the use of **synthetic (simulated) data** for initial testing and **real data collected from sequences of activities performed by millions of Microsoft Office customers** for further validation. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology in detail. In the **Code Failure Prediction using Synthetic Data** subsection, they explain that the synthetic data was generated based on specific rules for code failures and prevention. This synthetic dataset is crucial for understanding their model's performance.

In the **Code Failure Detection using Real Data** subsection, the authors provide details about the real dataset, which consists of telemetry events recorded from Excel users. They mention that the dataset was balanced to include both code failure and non-failure instances, which is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the synthetic dataset since it is generated by the authors, but it does provide a description of how it was created. For the real dataset, since it is derived from telemetry data collected from Microsoft Office users, I will note that it is proprietary data and may not have a formal citation.

Hereâ€™s a summary of the datasets identified:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: Generated based on predefined rules for code failures and prevention. No formal citation is available since it is created by the authors for the purpose of this study.

2. **Real Telemetry Dataset**: Collected from Microsoft Office users, consisting of telemetry events during their usage of Excel. This dataset is proprietary and does not have a formal citation.

I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and any relevant citations or notes regarding their origins. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
