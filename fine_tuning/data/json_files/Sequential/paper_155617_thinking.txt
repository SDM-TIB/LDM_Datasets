To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "A Study on Broadcast Networks for Music Genre Classification" by Ahmed Heakl et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to "relevant datasets such as GTZAN, Extended Ballroom, HOMBURG, and Free Music Archive (FMA)," indicating that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Computational Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly list the datasets and provide characteristics for each:

1. **GTZAN Dataset**: This dataset is described as a collection of 10 popular genres (blues, classical, country, disco, hip-hop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, rock) with 100 audio files each, all having a length of 30 seconds.

2. **Extended Ballroom Dataset**: This dataset includes 4180 30-second tracks grouped into 13 distinct genres, representing an improvement over the original ballroom dataset.

3. **HOMBURG Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1886 songs classified into nine unbalanced genres, with each sample lasting 10 seconds.

4. **Free Music Archive (FMA)**: The authors mention that they used the Small subset of FMA, which contains about 8000 tracks of 30-second songs distributed over eight balanced genres.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **GTZAN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Tzanetakis and P. Cook. "Musical genre classification of audio signals." *IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing*, vol. 10, no. 5, pp. 293–302, 2002.

- For the **Extended Ballroom Dataset**, the citation is:
  > U. Marchand and G. Peeters. "The extended ballroom dataset." 2016.

- For the **HOMBURG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Homburg, I. Mierswa, B. Möller, K. Morik, and M. Wurst. "A benchmark dataset for audio classification and clustering." In *ISMIR*, vol. 2005, pp. 528–531, 2005.

- For the **Free Music Archive (FMA)**, the citation is:
  > M. Defferrard, K. Benzi, P. Vandergheynst, and X. Bresson. "FMA: A dataset for music analysis." arXiv preprint arXiv:1612.01840, 2016.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about each dataset and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
