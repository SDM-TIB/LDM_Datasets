To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Depth-Adaptive Graph Recurrent Network for Text Classification" by Yijin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **24 datasets in various sizes and domains**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Task and Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. This section includes a table (Table 1) that provides detailed statistics about each dataset, including the number of classes, average lengths, and the number of training and testing samples.

From the table, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **TREC**: A question classification dataset with 6 classes.
2. **AGs News**: A topic classification dataset with 4 classes.
3. **DBPedia**: A topic classification dataset with 14 classes.
4. **Subj**: A sentiment classification dataset with 2 classes.
5. **MR**: A sentiment classification dataset with 2 classes.
6. **Amazon-16**: A sentiment classification dataset with 2 classes, which includes 16 subsets.
7. **IMDB**: A sentiment classification dataset with 2 classes.
8. **Yelp Polarity**: A sentiment classification dataset with 2 classes.
9. **Yelp Full**: A sentiment classification dataset with 5 classes.

I will also note the average lengths, maximum lengths, and sample sizes for training and testing for each dataset as provided in the table.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

For example, I will look for citations related to the following datasets:

- **TREC**: 
  > Li, X., & Roth, D. (2002). Learning question classifiers. In Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 2002).

- **AGs News**: 
  > Zhang, Y., Zhao, J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). Character-level convolutional networks for text classification. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

- **DBPedia**:

- **Yelp Polarity**:

- **Yelp Full**:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
