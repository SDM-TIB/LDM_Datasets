To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structured Weight Matrices-Based Hardware Accelerators in Deep Neural Networks: FPGAs and ASICs" by Caiwen Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved improvements using the datasets of **MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are central to their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments** section, specifically **section 6 (Evaluation)**, where the authors provide detailed comparisons of their proposed methods using these datasets. They mention using **MNIST**, **SVHN**, and **CIFAR-10** for their FPGA implementations and **TIMIT** for their LSTM evaluations. This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are as follows:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Li Deng. 2012. The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research [best of the web]. IEEE Signal Processing Magazine 29, 6 (2012), 141–142.

2. **SVHN Dataset**:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. 2011. Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, Vol. 2011. 5.

3. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. 2009. Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. (2009).

4. **TIMIT Dataset**:
   > Haşim Sak, Andrew Senior, and Françoise Beaufays. 2014. Long short-term memory recurrent neural network architectures for large scale acoustic modeling. In Fifteenth annual conference of the international speech communication association.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems.
2. **SVHN**: A real-world image dataset for digit recognition, collected from house numbers in Google Street View images.
3. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, widely used for machine learning and computer vision tasks.
4. **TIMIT**: A dataset for automatic speech recognition, containing recordings of phonetically balanced sentences.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
