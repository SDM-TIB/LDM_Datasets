To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Tree-based Decoder for Neural Machine Translation" by Xinyi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used. In this case, the abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on various datasets, which indicates that datasets will be discussed in detail later.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **KFTT (Japanese-English)**: This dataset consists of Japanese-English Wikipedia articles. The authors provide a brief description of its contents, which is essential for understanding its relevance to their experiments.

2. **IWSLT2016 (German-English)**: This dataset includes TED Talks transcriptions. The authors specify the nature of the data, which is crucial for contextualizing the results of their experiments.

3. **LORELEI (Oromo-English)**: This dataset primarily consists of texts from the Bible. The authors mention that it is a low-resource dataset, which is important for understanding the challenges faced in their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is critical for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **KFTT**:
  > Graham Neubig. *The Kyoto Free Translation Task*. 2011. Available at: http://www.phontron.com/kftt.

- For **IWSLT2016**:
  > M. Cettolo, J. Niehues, S. Stuker, L. Bentivogli, R. Cattoni, and M. Federico. *The IWSLT 2016 Evaluation Campaign*. In IWSLT, 2016.

- For **LORELEI**:
  > LDC2017E29. *LORELEI: Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents*. 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
