To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Translating Videos to Natural Language Using Deep Recurrent Neural Networks" by Subhashini Venugopalan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors are addressing the challenge of generating natural language descriptions for videos, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their research. Here, they mention:

1. **Microsoft Research Video Description Corpus**: This dataset consists of 1970 YouTube snippets, each lasting between 10 to 25 seconds, with multiple human-generated descriptions available for each video. The authors specify that they used 1200 videos for training, 100 for validation, and 670 for testing.

2. **Flickr30k Dataset**: This dataset contains approximately 30,000 images, each with five or more descriptions. The authors mention using this dataset to adapt their model for video description tasks.

3. **COCO2014 Dataset**: This dataset includes 82,783 training images and 40,504 validation images, each with five or more sentence descriptions. The authors also used this dataset for training and fine-tuning their models.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Microsoft Research Video Description Corpus**, the citation is:
  > David L. Chen and William B. Dolan. *Collecting highly parallel data for paraphrase evaluation*. In Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2011.

- For the **Flickr30k Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Micah Hodosh, Julia Hockenmaier, and Kate Saenko. *Generating image descriptions using dependency relational patterns*. In Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2014.

- For the **COCO2014 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Doll√°r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1405.0312, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
