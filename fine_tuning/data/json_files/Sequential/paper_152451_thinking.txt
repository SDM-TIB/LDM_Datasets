To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Future Semantic Segmentation with Convolutional LSTM" by Seyed Shahabeddin Nabavi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the goal of predicting semantic segmentation maps for future frames in videos, which suggests that a dataset is likely involved for training and evaluation purposes. 

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** (Section 4). In Section 4.1.1, the authors explicitly state that they conduct experiments on the **Cityscapes dataset**. This is a clear indication that this dataset is central to their research.

I will then gather details about the **Cityscapes dataset** from the text. The authors describe it as containing 2,975 training, 500 validation, and 1,525 testing video sequences, with each sequence comprising 30 frames and a resolution of 1024 Ã— 2048 pixels. They also mention that the dataset includes 19 semantic classes, which is important for understanding its application in semantic segmentation tasks.

To ensure I have the correct citation, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the Cityscapes dataset is as follows:
> Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the Cityscapes dataset for its experiments, I will conclude my extraction here, ensuring that I have accurately noted the dataset's details and citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
