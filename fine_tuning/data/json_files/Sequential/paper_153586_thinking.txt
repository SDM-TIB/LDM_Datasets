To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Variational Imitation Learning of Control Programs" by Roy Fox et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of hierarchical control policies and mentions experiments in two domains: Bubble Sort and Karel programs. This suggests that there are datasets related to these domains.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **Section 5.1 (Bubble Sort)**, the authors mention that they trained a hierarchical control policy using demonstration traces generated by a teacher executing the bubble sort algorithm. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name here.

In **Section 5.2 (Karel)**, the authors describe the generation of training and test data for Karel programs. They mention that they generated a total of 10,000 demonstrations for each program, but again, they do not specify a dataset name. Instead, they refer to the methodology used to create the datasets.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited. However, it appears that the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used in the experiments. Instead, it references prior works that describe the Karel programming language and the methodology for generating datasets.

Since the paper does not provide formal dataset names or citations, I will summarize the datasets based on the information provided:

1. **Bubble Sort Dataset**: This dataset consists of demonstration traces generated by a teacher executing the bubble sort algorithm on lists of integers. The exact details of the dataset (e.g., number of traces, format) are not specified.

2. **Karel Programs Dataset**: This dataset includes 10,000 demonstrations for each of the Karel programs, generated by sampling initial grid states and executing the programs. The specific programs are listed in Appendix A of the paper, but again, no formal dataset name or citation is provided.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to note that the datasets do not have formal citations but are derived from the methodologies described in the paper.

In conclusion, while I have identified the datasets used in the experiments, I must note that they lack formal citations. The datasets are based on the experimental setups described in the paper, specifically for the Bubble Sort and Karel programming tasks.
