To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High-Level Plan for Behavioral Robot Navigation with Natural Language Directions and R-NET" by Amar Shrestha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experimental task, and conclusion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions testing on a "navigation graph dataset," which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors reference the behavioral graph dataset from (Zang et al. 2018). This suggests that the dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I need to gather more details about it.

In the **experimental task section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset, stating that it consists of 8066 pairs of navigation plans and source-destination pairs collected from 88 unique simulated environments. They also mention two test sets: Test-repeated and Test-new, which contain 1012 and 946 samples, respectively. This section confirms the dataset's structure and its significance in their research.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the behavioral graph dataset is:

- For the **behavioral graph dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zang, X., Pokle, A., VÃ¡zquez, M., Chen, K., Niebles, J.C., Soto, A., and Savarese, S. (2018). *Translating Navigation Instructions in Natural Language to a High-Level Plan for Behavioral Robot Navigation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.00663.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following dataset information:
1. **Behavioral Graph Dataset**: Contains 8066 pairs of navigation plans and source-destination pairs, used for training and evaluation in the context of robot navigation.

I will ensure that the full citation is included in any final output to maintain academic integrity and provide proper credit to the original authors.
