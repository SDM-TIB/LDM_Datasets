To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Sequence Learning and Cross-Modality Convolution for 3D Biomedical Segmentation" by Kuan-Lun Tseng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are based on the **BRATS-2015 dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **CamVid dataset**: This dataset is described as the Cambridge-driving labelled video database, which includes videos with object class semantic labels. The authors specify that it contains 367 training and 100 validation images, with ground truth labels associating each pixel with one of 32 semantic classes.

2. **BRATS-2015 dataset**: This dataset is detailed as comprising 220 subjects with high-grade gliomas and 54 subjects with low-grade gliomas. The authors provide specifics about the size of the MRI images and the labels used for segmentation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **CamVid dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. J. Brostow, J. Shotton, J. Fauqueur, and R. Cipolla. *Segmentation and recognition using structure from motion point clouds*. In ECCV, 2008.

- For the **BRATS-2015 dataset**, the citation is:
  > B. H. Menze, A. Jakab, S. Bauer, J. Kalpathy-Cramer, K. Farahani, J. Kirby, Y. Burren, N. Porz, J. Slotboom, R. Wiest, et al. *The multimodal brain tumor image segmentation benchmark (brats)*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 2015.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into the required format for further processing or review.
