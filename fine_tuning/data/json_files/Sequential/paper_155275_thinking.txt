To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Correcting Diacritics and Typos with a ByT5 Transformer Model" by Lukas Stankevičius et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors perform diacritics restoration on benchmark datasets of 12 languages, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using a **Wikipedia dataset** for 12 languages, which is crucial for their diacritics restoration task. They also include Lithuanian as an additional language, indicating that they have expanded their dataset beyond the original 12.

The paper provides specific details about the dataset, including that it consists of training, development, and testing sets, and that it is preprocessed for use with their model. The authors also mention the total number of sentences and the characteristics of the dataset, which is important for understanding the context in which the datasets are used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the Wikipedia dataset and provide links for accessing the data. However, they do not provide a formal citation for the Wikipedia dataset itself, as it is a widely recognized resource.

For the Lithuanian dataset, they mention using tools provided by the original authors, which I will also need to cite properly. The citation for the Lithuanian dataset is:
> "Data for Lithuanian were used from here: https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~majlis/w2c/download.html."

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and the full citations as required.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Wikipedia Dataset**: A multilingual dataset used for diacritics restoration across 12 languages, including Lithuanian.
2. **Lithuanian Dataset**: A specific dataset for the Lithuanian language, accessible via the provided link.

I will now prepare the structured output for these datasets, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and reference.
