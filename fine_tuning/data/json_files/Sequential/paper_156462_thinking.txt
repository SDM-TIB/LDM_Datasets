To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-level biomedical NER through multi-granularity embeddings and enhanced labeling" by Fahime Shahrokh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on the **i2b2/2010 dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look specifically in **section 4 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors discuss their evaluation methods. In **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, they explicitly mention the **i2b2 2010 dataset**. The authors describe this dataset as containing 170 patient reports for the training set and 256 reports for the test set, annotated with three labels: Problem, Treatment, and Test. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the i2b2 2010 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Uzuner, Ã–., South, B. R., Shen, S., & DuVall, S. L. (2011). 2010 i2b2/VA challenge on concepts, assertions, and relations in clinical text. *Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association*, 18(5), 552-556.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset in a structured manner. The only dataset mentioned in this paper is the i2b2 2010 dataset, which is crucial for their experiments on biomedical named entity recognition.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured output that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
