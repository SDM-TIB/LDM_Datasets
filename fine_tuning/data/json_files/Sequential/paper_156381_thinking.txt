To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visible to Thermal Image Translation for Improving Visual Task in Low Light Conditions" by Md Azim Khan, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that images were collected from two different locations using a thermal drone, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically the **Dataset collection subsection**. Here, the author states that RGB and thermal data were collected using the Parrot ANAFI Thermal drone. The paper specifies that the dataset consists of 500 images, including both RGB and thermal images, collected under various conditions (midday, evening, and night) from two different locations at UMBC.

I will also check the **results and discussion section** to confirm the dataset's characteristics and any additional details that might be relevant for documentation.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **RGB and Thermal Image Dataset**: This dataset includes 500 images collected using the Parrot ANAFI Thermal drone. The images are taken under different lighting conditions (midday, evening, and night) and consist of both RGB and thermal images.

Next, I will look for the full citation for the dataset. The paper mentions the use of the Parrot ANAFI Thermal drone, so I will reference the technical documentation for this drone as the source of the dataset:

- For the **RGB and Thermal Image Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Parrot ANAFI Technical Documentation. *Parrot ANAFI Product Sheet*. Available at: https://www.parrot.com/assets/s3fs-public/2021-02/anafi-product-sheet-white-paper-en.pdf. Accessed: 2021-02-10.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset and its citation, ready for any further processing or review.
