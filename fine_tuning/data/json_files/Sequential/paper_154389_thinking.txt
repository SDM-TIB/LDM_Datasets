To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning Interference Cancellation in Wireless Networks" by Yiming Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses a neural network-based technique for interference cancellation but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **results section** where the authors describe their experiments. They mention generating **1000 radio frames** through simulation, with specific details about the training, validation, and testing splits. However, they do not refer to any publicly available datasets or benchmark datasets; instead, they seem to have created their own simulated data for the experiments.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets that might be relevant to the context of this research. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing methodologies and techniques rather than datasets.

Given that the authors have not utilized any established datasets but rather generated their own data for the purpose of their experiments, I will note that there are no external datasets to cite in this case.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings:
- The paper does not mention any publicly available datasets.
- The authors generated their own simulated data for the experiments, which does not have a formal citation.

Since there are no datasets to extract and cite, I will prepare a brief note indicating the absence of external datasets in this research paper.
