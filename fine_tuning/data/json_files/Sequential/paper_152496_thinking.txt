To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust training of recurrent neural networks to handle missing data for disease progression modeling" by Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for modeling Alzheimer's disease progression using longitudinal data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their data preparation process. They mention utilizing the **TADPOLE dataset** for their experiments, which is a key dataset for their study. I will look for specific details about this dataset, including its composition and the context in which it is used.

In the **data preparation subsection**, the authors provide a detailed description of the TADPOLE dataset, stating that it includes data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) across multiple phases. They mention that the dataset consists of roughly 1,500 biomarkers from 1,737 subjects during 12,741 visits, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the TADPOLE dataset. The authors reference the TADPOLE challenge, which is associated with the dataset. The citation for the TADPOLE dataset is:
> Razvan V. Marinescu, Neil P. Oxtoby, Alexandra L. Young, Esther E. Bron, Arthur W. Toga, Michael W. Weiner, Frederik Barkhof, Nick C. Fox, Stefan Klein, and Daniel C. Alexander. *TADPOLE challenge: Prediction of longitudinal evolution in Alzheimer’s disease*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.03909, 2018.

Now, I will summarize the findings about the dataset:

1. **TADPOLE Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for modeling the progression of Alzheimer's disease using longitudinal measurements of imaging biomarkers. It includes data from the ADNI phases ADNI 1, ADNI GO, and ADNI 2, comprising 1,737 subjects and 12,741 visits.

With this information, I will prepare to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
