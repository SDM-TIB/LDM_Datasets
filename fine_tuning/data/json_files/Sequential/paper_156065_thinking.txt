To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empirical Analysis of the Inductive Bias of Recurrent Neural Networks by Discrete Fourier Transform of Output Sequences" by Taiga Ishii, Ryo Ueda, and Yusuke Miyao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the inductive bias of RNNs and mention that they constructed synthetic datasets for their experiments. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific details.

Next, I will look into the **methods section**, particularly where they describe the dataset construction. The authors detail how they randomly generated 500 synthetic datasets for their experiments, which is crucial information. They explain the process of creating these datasets, including the sampling of sequences and label changes.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used these synthetic datasets to train models and analyze the inductive bias of different RNN architectures. This reinforces the importance of the datasets they created.

Now, I will check the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited. However, the paper primarily focuses on synthetic datasets generated by the authors, so I will note that these datasets do not have external citations.

The key datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The authors generated 500 synthetic datasets for their experiments, focusing on binary sequence classification tasks. The datasets are constructed based on binary sequences with varying label changes.

Since these synthetic datasets do not have formal citations like publicly available datasets, I will note that they are original datasets created for the purpose of this research.

Finally, I will compile the information about the datasets, ensuring to highlight that they are synthetic and generated by the authors, and summarize the dataset details clearly.

In conclusion, the main dataset extracted is the collection of 500 synthetic datasets created by the authors for their experiments on RNNs, with no external citations required.
