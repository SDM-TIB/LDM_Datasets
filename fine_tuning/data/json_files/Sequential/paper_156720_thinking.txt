To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Vessel Location Forecasting and the Effect of Federated Learning" by Andreas Tritsarolis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use "three large-volume real-world maritime AIS datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **Section IV (Experimental Study)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets: **Brest**, **Piraeus**, and **Aegean**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In **Table I**, the authors provide statistics for each dataset, including spatial and temporal ranges, number of records, number of vessels, and sampling rates. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and relevance.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper mentions that the Brest and Piraeus datasets are publicly available with DOI links, while the Aegean dataset is proprietary and provided by Kpler for research purposes. I will ensure to include the DOI links for the publicly available datasets in the citations.

The citations I will compile are as follows:

1. **Brest Dataset**:
   > Brest dataset is publicly available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1167594.

2. **Piraeus Dataset**:
   > Piraeus dataset is publicly available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5562629.

3. **Aegean Dataset**:
   > The Aegean dataset was provided by Kpler for research purposes in the context of project MobiSpaces (https://mobispaces.eu).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
