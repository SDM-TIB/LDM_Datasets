To extract datasets from the research paper titled "English to Bangla Machine Translation Using Recurrent Neural Network" by Shaykh Siddique et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses an English to Bangla machine translation system, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for parallel sentences in English and Bangla for training their model. This hints at the existence of a dataset, but I need to find specific details.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled "Data Collection." Here, the authors state that the main dataset consists of **4000 English and Bangla parallel sentences** collected from various articles. This is a clear identification of the dataset used in their research.

The authors also mention that the dataset is split into an **80:20 ratio for training and testing**, which provides additional context about how the dataset is utilized.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is described as being collected from articles written by humans, it may not have a formal citation like established datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is a collection of parallel sentences from various articles.

Since there are no formal citations for the dataset, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: English-Bangla Parallel Sentences Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of 4000 parallel sentences in English and Bangla, collected from various articles manually written in both languages.
   - **Usage**: Used for training and testing the English to Bangla machine translation model.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of the dataset as described in the paper. 

After completing this process, I will have a clear entry for the dataset that reflects its significance in the research while adhering to the requirement for full citation where applicable.
