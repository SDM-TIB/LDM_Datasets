To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STAGE: Tool for Automated Extraction of Semantic Time Cues to Enrich Neural Temporal Ordering Models" by Luke Breitfeller et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate the utility of their system on "two event ordering datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors discuss their evaluation methods. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **TimeBank-Dense**: This dataset consists of 36 English news articles annotated with events and temporal relations using the TimeML annotation scheme. The authors provide a breakdown of the dataset sizes for training, development, and testing.

2. **TDDiscourse**: This dataset is an augmentation of TimeBank-Dense, focusing on annotating temporal relations between events that are more than one sentence apart. It is divided into two subsets: TDD-Auto (automatically generated relations) and TDD-Man (manually annotated relations).

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **TimeBank-Dense**, the citation is:
  > Taylor Cassidy, Bill McDowell, Nathanel Chambers, and Steven Bethard. *An annotation framework for dense event ordering*. Technical report, CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIV PITTSBURGH PA, 2014.

- For **TDDiscourse**, the citation is:
  > Aakanksha Naik, Luke Breitfeller, and Carolyn Rose. *TDDiscourse: A dataset for discourse-level temporal ordering of events*. In Proceedings of the 20th Annual SIGdial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue, pages 239â€“249, Stockholm, Sweden, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
