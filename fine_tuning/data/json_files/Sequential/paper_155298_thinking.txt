To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Progressive Graph Convolutional Networks for Spatial-Temporal Traffic Forecasting" by Yuyol Shin and Yoonjin Yoon, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the model was evaluated on "four real-world traffic datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 5**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets as follows:

1. **PeMS-Bay**: A highway speed dataset collected by California Transportation Agencies (CalTrans) Performance Measurement System (PeMS), containing 6 months of data aggregated at a frequency of 5 minutes, with 325 loop detectors in the Bay area.

2. **METR-LA**: A highway traffic flow dataset collected from 207 loop detectors in Los Angeles County, containing 3 months of data aggregated at a frequency of 5 minutes.

3. **Urban-core**: An urban speed dataset collected from Digital Tacho Graph (DTG) on Seoul Taxis, including speed data aggregated at road segment level in 5-minute resolution for 1 month, with 304 road segments.

4. **Seattle-Loop**: A highway speed dataset collected from 323 loop detectors in the Greater Seattle Area, containing 5-minute resolution data for the entirety of 2015.

The authors also provide a summary table (Table 1) that includes details such as the number of samples, nodes, frequency, and type of traffic data for each dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **PeMS-Bay**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Yu, R., Shahabi, C., & Liu, T. (2018). Diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network: Data-driven traffic forecasting. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

- For **METR-LA**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Yu, R., Shahabi, C., & Liu, T. (2018). Diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network: Data-driven traffic forecasting. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

- For **Urban-core**, the citation is:
  > Shin, Y., & Yoon, Y. (2021). A Comparative Study on Basic Elements of Deep Learning Models for Spatial-Temporal Traffic Forecasting. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.07513.

- For **Seattle-Loop**, the citation is:
  > Shin, Y., & Yoon, Y. (2021). A Comparative Study on Basic Elements of Deep Learning Models for Spatial-Temporal Traffic Forecasting. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.07513.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and comprehensively.
