To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Comparing linear structure-based and data-driven latent spatial representations for sequence prediction" by Myriam Bontonou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions that the authors perform experiments with various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of predicting spatially structured temporal sequences. They mention using datasets made of images and fMRI signals, but I need to find the specific names and details of these datasets.

In the **datasets section**, the authors explicitly list three datasets:

1. **MovingSTL**: This dataset is derived from the STL10 dataset, consisting of 5000 images that are transformed into grey images and normalized. It includes sequences of images where a square moves across the image.

2. **MovingMNIST**: This dataset consists of 5000 sequences of images displaying moving white numbers on a black background, with each image being 64 × 64 pixels.

3. **Resting state fMRI dataset**: This dataset is a subset of 62 subjects from the MPILMBB resting-state dataset, where participants were measured at rest. The data was preprocessed and normalized to MNI space.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **STL10**, the citation is:
  > Coates, A., Ng, A., and Lee, H. "An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning." In Proceedings of the fourteenth international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics, 215–223, 2011.

- For **MovingMNIST**, the citation is:
  > Szeto, R., Stent, S., Ros, G., and Corso, J. J. "A dataset to evaluate the representations learned by video prediction models." In International Conference on Learning Representations (Workshop Track), April 2018.

- For the **MPILMBB resting-state dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mendes, N., Oligschlaeger, S., Lauckner, M. E., Golchert, J., Huntenburg, J. M., Falkiewicz, M., Ellamil, M., Krause, S., Baczkowski, B. M., Cozatl, R., et al. "A functional connectome phenotyping dataset including cognitive state and personality measures." Scientific data 6, 180307, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
