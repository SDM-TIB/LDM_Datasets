To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating ROCKET and Catch22 features for calf behaviour classification from accelerometer data using Machine Learning models" by Oshana Dissanayake et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, indicating that accelerometer data was collected from calves, which suggests that a dataset exists.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, particularly the **Data Collection subsection**. Here, the authors describe the experiment conducted at Teagasc Moorepark Research Farm, where 47 Irish Holstein Friesian and Jersey pre-weaned calves were equipped with accelerometer sensors. This section details the data collection process, including the duration of observation and the behaviors annotated, which is crucial for understanding the dataset.

In this section, the authors mention that a total of **27.4 hours of observation** was performed, and they created a dataset from **30 calves** that exhibited a wide range of behaviors. They also specify that the dataset includes annotations for six behaviors indicative of calf welfare: drinking milk, grooming, lying, running, walking, and other.

I will also look for any tables or figures that summarize the data collected. For instance, **Table 2** provides a summary of the total duration of observation and the number of sequences associated with each behavior, which is essential for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. The authors may cite previous works that describe the datasets or methodologies they used, which is important for proper attribution.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for any datasets mentioned. The key datasets identified are:

1. **Accelerometer Dataset**: This dataset consists of accelerometer data collected from 30 calves, with annotations for various behaviors. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it appears to be original data collected for this study.

2. **Behavioral Observation Dataset**: This dataset includes the annotations of behaviors observed in the calves, which were recorded using the BORIS software. Again, this dataset is original to the study and does not have a separate citation.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the details of each dataset, including the context of their use in the study, and prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing.
