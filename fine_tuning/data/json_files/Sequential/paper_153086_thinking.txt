To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Embedding time expressions for deep temporal ordering models" by Tanya Goyal and Greg Durrett, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on the **MATRES dataset** and a **distantly collected dataset**, indicating that these are key datasets to focus on.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional context or details about these datasets. The authors discuss the importance of temporal ordering and mention the MATRES dataset specifically, which is designed for temporal relation extraction.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of how the datasets were used. The authors explicitly state that they evaluate their model on the **MATRES dataset** and describe its characteristics, including its temporal annotations derived from various sources like TimeBank and AQUAINT. They also mention constructing another dataset using distant supervision, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

I will then check the **appendix** for any supplementary information about the datasets, including examples or templates used for generating synthetic data. The appendix provides insights into how the distant dataset was created using high-precision classifiers, which adds depth to my understanding of the dataset's construction.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **MATRES Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Qiang Ning, Zhili Feng, and Dan Roth. *A Multi-Axis Annotation Scheme for Event Temporal Relations*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1318–1328, 2018.

2. **Distantly Collected Dataset**: Since this dataset is constructed using rule-based classifiers and does not have a specific citation, I will note that it is derived from the methods described in the paper by Chambers et al. (2014):
   > Nathanael Chambers et al. *Dense event ordering with a multi-pass architecture*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2:273–284, 2014.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets along with their citations, ready for any further processing or review. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research.
