To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Orthogonal Gated Recurrent Unit with Neumann-Cayley Transformation" by Edison Mucllari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction may reference datasets used in prior work or in the context of the current study.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing section 4, I find that the authors mention several tasks and datasets:

1. **Parenthesis Task**: This is a synthetic dataset designed to test the model's ability to remember unmatched parentheses. The input consists of 10 pairs of different types of parentheses combined with noise data.

2. **Denoise Task**: Another synthetic dataset where the model must filter out noise from a sequence containing 10 randomly located data points.

3. **Adding Task**: This task involves a 2-dimensional sequence where the first dimension contains zeros and two randomly placed ones, while the second dimension contains randomly selected numbers. The goal is to sum the numbers corresponding to the positions of the ones.

4. **Copying Problem**: This task tests the model's ability to copy a sequence of 10 random digits followed by zeros.

5. **Penn Treebank (PTB) Dataset**: This is a well-known dataset used for language modeling tasks, consisting of English-language Wall Street Journal articles.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The Penn Treebank dataset is referenced, and I will ensure to include its citation. The other tasks are synthetic and do not have formal citations, but I will note their descriptions.

The citation for the Penn Treebank dataset is:
- Marcus, M. P., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., & Santorini, B. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:
1. **Parenthesis Task**: Synthetic dataset for testing memory of unmatched parentheses.
2. **Denoise Task**: Synthetic dataset for filtering noise from sequences.
3. **Adding Task**: Synthetic dataset for summing numbers based on specific positions.
4. **Copying Problem**: Synthetic dataset for copying sequences of digits.
5. **Penn Treebank Dataset**: A well-known dataset for language modeling tasks.

Now, I will prepare the entries for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation for the Penn Treebank dataset.
