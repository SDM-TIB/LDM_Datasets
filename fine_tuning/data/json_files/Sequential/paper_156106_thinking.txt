To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Transport Warping for Time Series" by Fabian Latorre et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed Optimal Transport Warping (OTW) method on various time series datasets, which suggests that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention that they evaluated their method on the **UCR time series classification archive**, which is a well-known collection of time series datasets.

I will then look for specific subsections within Section 4 that detail the datasets used. The authors mention that they evaluated their method on **92 datasets** from the UCR archive, and they provide a summary of results in tables. I will check these tables for the names of the datasets and their corresponding types.

In the **appendices**, particularly Appendix A, the authors provide a detailed list of datasets used in their experiments, including their types and performance metrics. This is crucial for extracting the dataset names and ensuring I have the correct context for each.

Now, I will compile the dataset names and their citations. The UCR time series classification archive is a collection of datasets, and I will need to cite the original source of this archive. The citation for the UCR time series classification archive is:

> Eamonn Keogh, "UCR Time Series Classification Archive," 2018. Available at: https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data_2018/

Additionally, I will note that the paper mentions specific datasets like **ECG200**, **ECG5000**, and others, which are part of the UCR archive. However, since these datasets are part of a larger collection, I will refer to the UCR archive citation rather than individual citations for each dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the UCR archive citation as the authoritative source for the datasets mentioned.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each entry is clear and includes the necessary citations.
