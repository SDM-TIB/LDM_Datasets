To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Prosodic Phrasing with Multi-Task Learning in Tacotron-based TTS" by Rui Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section IV, the authors mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they used the **TsingHua-Corpus of Speech Synthesis (TH-CoSS)** for Chinese and a subset of Mongolian speech data. This indicates that these are the primary datasets utilized in their study.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets within the same section. The authors provide specific information about the **TsingHua-Corpus**, noting that it contains approximately 9 hours of speech data and 5.6k utterances with 103k words. For the Mongolian dataset, they mention it contains about 17 hours of speech data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For the **TsingHua-Corpus of Speech Synthesis (TH-CoSS)**, the citation is:
   > L. Cai, D. Cui, and R. Cai. "TH-CoSS, a Mandarin Speech Corpus for TTS." *Journal of Chinese Information Processing*, vol. 21, no. 2, 2007.

2. For the **Mongolian speech data**, the citation is:
   > J. Li, H. Zhang, R. Liu, X. Zhang, and F. Bao. "End-to-End Mongolian Text-to-Speech System." In *ISCSLP 2018 – 11th International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing*, NOVEMBER 26-29, TAIPEI, Proceedings, 2018, pp. 3062–3066.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **TsingHua-Corpus of Speech Synthesis (TH-CoSS)**: A Mandarin speech corpus containing approximately 9 hours of speech data and 5.6k utterances with 103k words.
- **Mongolian speech data**: A dataset containing about 17 hours of speech data, used for training the prosody generator.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that the citations are correctly formatted for inclusion in any further documentation or analysis.
