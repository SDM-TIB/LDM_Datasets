To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Video2Shop: Exact Matching Clothes in Videos to Online Shopping Images" by Zhi-Qi Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted on a large cross-domain dataset, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention that they collected a new dataset specifically for the Video2Shop application, which is described in detail in the **experiments section**.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about the dataset:
- The dataset consists of **26,352 clothing trajectories in videos** and **85,677 clothing images from shops**. This indicates that the dataset is substantial and specifically tailored for their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the authors mention that this is a new dataset they collected, it may not have a formal citation yet. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper itself.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Video2Shop Dataset**: This dataset includes 26,352 clothing trajectories extracted from videos and 85,677 corresponding clothing images from online shops. The dataset is specifically designed for the task of matching clothing items in videos to those available for purchase online.

Since this dataset is newly created and described in the paper, I will not have a traditional citation but will reference the paper itself as the source of this dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. The key points to include are the dataset name, description, and the source paper citation.

The citation for the paper is:
> Zhi-Qi Cheng, Xiao Wu, Yang Liu, Xian-Sheng Hua. *Video2Shop: Exact Matching Clothes in Videos to Online Shopping Images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

With this information, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and complete for any future use or reference.
