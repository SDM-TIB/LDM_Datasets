To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conversational Help for Task Completion and Feature Discovery in Personal Assistants" by Madan Gopal Jhawar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the system proposed, but I need to look for specific datasets used for evaluation or training.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they mined a dataset comprising **200K unique queries from anonymized and privacy-preserved Cortana logs**. This dataset is crucial as it forms the basis for their help query classification system.

The authors detail that the dataset was manually labeled by human judges into two categories: help or not help, and that it includes **24 different supported skills**. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from internal logs and not published in a separate paper, it may not have a formal citation. In this case, I will note that the dataset is based on internal Cortana logs and does not have a traditional citation.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Cortana Help Query Dataset**: This dataset consists of 200,000 unique queries mined from anonymized and privacy-preserved logs of internal users of Cortana. The queries were manually labeled by human judges into two categories: help or not help, with additional tagging for predefined responses. The dataset covers 24 different supported skills.

Since there is no formal citation for this dataset, I will indicate that it is based on internal data from Microsoft.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I clearly indicate the lack of a formal citation for the dataset.
