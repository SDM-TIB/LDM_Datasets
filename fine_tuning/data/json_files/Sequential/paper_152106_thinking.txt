To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modelling prosodic structure using Artificial Neural Networks" by Jean-Philippe Bernardy and Charalambos Themistocleous, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on classifying tonal patterns in Cypriot Greek, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the aim of the study and the neural network architectures used, but it does not provide specific dataset names.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention, as this is where datasets are often detailed. Here, the authors mention that they produced **1966 statement productions** and **2860 Wh-questions** from female speakers of Cypriot Greek. However, they do not provide a specific name for a dataset; instead, they describe the data collection process and the characteristics of the utterances.

Since the paper does not refer to a formally named dataset, I will note the details provided about the data: the number of productions, the demographic of the speakers, and the nature of the utterances. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context, even if it lacks a formal title.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited that may have been used in the study. However, the references primarily consist of works related to neural networks and prosody, rather than specific datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide formal dataset names or citations, I will summarize the data characteristics as follows:

1. **Cypriot Greek Statement Productions**: 1966 productions from 25 female speakers.
2. **Cypriot Greek Wh-Questions**: 2860 productions from 20 female speakers.

Since there are no formal citations for these datasets, I will note that the data is original to the study and does not have an external reference.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring to highlight the original nature of the dataset and the context in which it was collected, even though it lacks formal citations.

This process will ensure that I accurately capture the essence of the datasets discussed in the paper, despite the absence of named datasets or citations.
