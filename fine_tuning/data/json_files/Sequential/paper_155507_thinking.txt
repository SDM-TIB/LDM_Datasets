To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Control Theoretic Framework for Adaptive Gradient Optimizers in Machine Learning" by Kushal Chakrabarti and Nikhil Chopra, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in prior work or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on benchmark machine learning tasks, specifically image classification using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** and language modeling using the **Penn TreeBank (PTB) dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets within the text. The CIFAR-10 dataset is described as consisting of 60,000 tiny color images in 10 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The Penn TreeBank dataset is mentioned as containing 929,000 training words, 73,000 validation words, and 82,000 test words.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

For the **Penn TreeBank dataset**, the citation is:
> Mitchell Marcus, Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. 1993.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
