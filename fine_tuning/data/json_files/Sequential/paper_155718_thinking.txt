To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spoken Term Detection and Relevance Score Estimation using Dot-Product of Pronunciation Embeddings" by Jan Švec et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method is evaluated on data from the MALACH archive, which suggests that this is a key dataset.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset description)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that the method was evaluated on data from the USC-SFI MALACH archive in two languages: English and Czech. This section provides crucial details about the datasets.

I will note the specifics provided in this section:
1. **USC-SFI MALACH Archive (English)**: This dataset is used for spoken term detection in English and is recognized using both word- and phoneme-level recognizers.
2. **USC-SFI MALACH Archive (Czech)**: Similar to the English dataset, this dataset is used for spoken term detection in Czech, also recognized using word- and phoneme-level recognizers.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **English MALACH dataset**, the citation is:
  > B. Ramabhadran, S. Gustman, W. Byrne, J. Hajič, D. Oard, J. S. Olsson, M. Picheny, and J. Psutka. *USC-SFI MALACH Interviews and Transcripts English LDC2012S05*. 2012. Available: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012s05

- For the **Czech MALACH dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Psutka, V. Radová, P. Ircing, L. Müller, J. Matoušek. *USC-SFI MALACH Interviews and Transcripts Czech LDC2014S04*. 2014. Available: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2014S04

With these details in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
