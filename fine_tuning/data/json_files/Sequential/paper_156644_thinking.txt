To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrative Deep Learning Framework for Parkinson's Disease Early Detection using Gait Cycle Data Measured by Wearable Sensors: A CNN-GRU-GNN Approach" by Alireza Rashnu and Armin Salimi-Badr, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes gait cycle datasets for early detection of Parkinson's disease, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data description)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used. Here, they mention three datasets collected from different research groups, specifically:

1. **Ga Dataset**: This dataset includes gait measurements from a cohort of individuals diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and healthy controls. It consists of data from 30 subjects (10 healthy controls and 20 Parkinson's patients).

2. **Ju Dataset**: Similar to the Ga dataset, this dataset includes measurements from 28 subjects (12 healthy controls and 16 Parkinson's patients).

3. **Si Dataset**: This dataset comprises data from 40 subjects (18 healthy controls and 22 Parkinson's patients).

The paper also provides a detailed breakdown of the number of samples collected from each dataset, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's size and structure.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference three studies that contributed to the datasets:

- For the **Ga Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yogev G, Giladi N, Peretz C, Springer S, Simon E S, and Hausdorff J M. *Dual tasking, gait rhythmicity, and Parkinson's disease: which aspects of gait are attention demanding?* European Journal of Neuroscience, 22(5): 1248-1256, 2005.

- For the **Ju Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hausdorff J M, Lowenthal J, Herman T, Gruendlinger L, Peretz C, and Giladi N. *Rhythmic auditory stimulation modulates gait variability in Parkinson's disease.* European Journal of Neuroscience, 26(8): 2369-2375, 2007.

- For the **Si Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Frenkel-Toledo S, Giladi N, Peretz C, Herman T, Gruendlinger L, and Hausdorff J M. *Treadmill walking as an external pacemaker to improve gait rhythm and stability in Parkinson's disease.* Movement Disorders, 20(9): 1109-1114, 2005.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
