To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intent-conditioned and Non-toxic Counterspeech Generation using Multi-Task Instruction Tuning with RLAIF" by Amey Hengle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study. 

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their dataset, which is likely to be detailed in the **dataset section**. In this paper, the authors introduce the **IntentCONANv2 dataset**, which is a significant part of their research. I will note the specifics of this dataset, including its size, structure, and the types of counterspeech it contains.

In the **dataset section**, the authors provide detailed statistics about the **IntentCONANv2 dataset**, including the number of counterspeech instances and the distribution across different intents (positive, informative, questioning, and denouncing). They mention that the dataset consists of **13,952 counterspeeches for 3,488 hate speech instances**, which is crucial information to include.

Additionally, I will look for any references to other datasets that may have been used in the study, such as the **COBRACORPUS dataset**, which is mentioned in the context of hate speech explanation generation. This dataset is important for understanding the background and context of the counterspeech generation task.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. For the **IntentCONANv2 dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but I will note that it is an expanded version of the original **IntentCONAN dataset** by Gupta et al. (2023). Therefore, I will include that citation as well.

For the **COBRACORPUS dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references, which is attributed to Zhou et al. (2023b).

Now, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations:

1. **IntentCONANv2 Dataset**:
   - Description: A large-scale dataset comprising 13,952 counterspeeches across four distinct intents (positive, informative, questioning, and denouncing) for 3,488 hate speech instances.
   - Citation: Gupta, R., Desai, S., Goel, M., Bandhakavi, A., Chakroborty, T., & Akhtar, M. S. (2023). Counterspeeches up my sleeve! intent distribution learning and persistent fusion for intent-conditioned counterspeech generation. In Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 5792–5809, Toronto, Canada. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **COBRACORPUS Dataset**:
   - Description: A dataset of offensive statements paired with free-text explanations along seven pragmatic frames of hate speech.
   - Citation: Zhou, W., Jiang, Y. E., Wilcox, E., Cotterell, R., & Sachan, M. (2023). COBRA frames: Contextual reasoning about effects and harms of offensive statements. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL 2023, pages 6294–6315, Toronto, Canada. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is structured clearly for any further processing or review.
