To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Magnitude: A Fast, Efficient Universal Vector Embedding Utility Package" by Ajay Patel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss the methodology and experiments** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the tool and its capabilities, but it may not specify datasets directly.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the purpose of Magnitude and its features. I will look for any references to datasets used for benchmarking or evaluation purposes.

In the **experiments or results sections**, I will look for any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets used in their evaluations. For instance, if they mention using pre-trained models or datasets for comparison, I will note those down.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and credit for the datasets used in their research.

From the reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Google News Word2Vec Model**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of performance comparisons with Gensim. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Tomas Mikolov, Kai Chen, Greg Corrado, and Jeffrey Dean. *Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space*. CoRR, abs/1301.3781, 2013.

2. **GloVe Embeddings**: The authors mention GloVe as another embedding model they support. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Jeffrey Pennington, Richard Socher, and Christopher Manning. *GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation*. In Proceedings of EMNLP, pages 1532â€“1543, Doha, Qatar, 2014.

3. **fastText Embeddings**: This is another dataset mentioned in the context of embeddings. The citation is:
   > Piotr Bojanowski, Edouard Grave, Armand Joulin, and Tomas Mikolov. *Enriching Word Vectors with Subword Information*. CoRR, abs/1607.04606, 2016.

4. **ELMo Embeddings**: The authors also reference ELMo embeddings. The citation is:
   > Matthew E. Peters, Mark Neumann, Mohit Iyyer, Matt Gardner, Christopher Clark, Kenton Lee, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *Deep Contextualized Word Representations*. CoRR, abs/1802.05365, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each dataset and prepare to format them according to the required structure for downstream processing. This will involve compiling the dataset names, descriptions, and citations into a structured format for easy access and reference.
