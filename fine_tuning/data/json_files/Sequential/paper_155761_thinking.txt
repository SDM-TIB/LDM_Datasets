To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic loss balancing and sequential enhancement for road-safety assessment and traffic scene classification" by Marin Kačan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a novel dataset called **iRAP-BH**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **iRAP-BH**: This dataset consists of georeferenced video collected along 2,300 km of public roads in Bosnia and Herzegovina, annotated with 52 iRAP attributes. It includes 214,073 training segments, 5,813 validation segments, and 6,563 testing segments.

2. **Honda Scenes**: This dataset contains 80 training and 20 evaluation videos, with annotations for four traffic scene classification problems. It includes a total of 760,000 training frames and 160,000 evaluation frames.

3. **FM3m**: This dataset consists of 11,448 images of traffic scenes from Croatian roads, with 6,413 images in the main subset. The dataset is labeled with binary attributes for classification.

4. **BDD100k**: This dataset includes 100,000 video clips from various environments, with annotations for scene, weather, and time of day. It has 80,000 training images, 10,000 validation images, and 20,000 test images.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

- For **iRAP-BH**, since it is a novel dataset introduced in this paper, I will note that it will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.
  
- For **Honda Scenes**, the citation is:

- For **FM3m**, the citation is:
  > I. Sikiric, K. Brkic, P. Bevandic, I. Kreso, J. Krapac, and S. Segvic. *Traffic scene classification on a representation budget*. IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, vol. 21, no. 1, pp. 336–345, 2020.

- For **BDD100k**, the citation is:
  > F. Yu, H. Chen, X. Wang, W. Xian, Y. Chen, F. Liu, V. Madhavan, and T. Darrell. *BDD100K: A diverse driving dataset for heterogeneous multitask learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2633–2642, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
