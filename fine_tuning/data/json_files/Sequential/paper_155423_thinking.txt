To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STRATA: Word Boundaries & Phoneme Recognition From Continuous Urdu Speech using Transfer Learning, Attention, & Data Augmentation" by Saad Naeem and Dr. Mirza Omer Beg, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors improved upon the state of the art for the **TIMIT dataset (English)** and the **CSaLT dataset (Urdu)**. This suggests that both datasets are relevant for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **methodology** and **evaluation** sections. In the **evaluation section**, the authors mention that they used **1.15 hours of phonetically transcribed data** from the **Centre of Speech and Language Technologies (CSaLT)**, which is publicly available. They also discuss augmenting this data to create a total of **11.5 hours** for training.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for both datasets, confirming their use in the experiments. They report a **Phoneme Error Rate (PER)** of **16.5% for the TIMIT dataset** and **75.5% accuracy for the CSaLT dataset**.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **references section** of the paper:

1. For the **TIMIT dataset**, the citation is:
   > J. S. Garofolo, L. F. Lamel, W. M. Fisher, J. G. Fiscus, and D. S. Pallett. *TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus LDC93S1*. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, 1993.

2. For the **CSaLT dataset**, the citation is:
   > Centre of Speech and Language Technologies (CSaLT). *Phonetically Transcribed Urdu Speech Data*. Available at: [CSaLT website link].

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets as they are crucial for proper attribution and reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that can be used for further analysis or processing.
