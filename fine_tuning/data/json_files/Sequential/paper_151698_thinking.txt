To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cube Padding for Weakly-Supervised Saliency Prediction in 360◦ Videos" by Hsien-Tzu Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dataset called **Wild-360**, which is a strong indicator that this is a key dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of saliency prediction in 360° videos and the need for a dedicated dataset. They mention that existing datasets do not provide ground truth saliency map annotations for 360° videos, reinforcing the importance of the **Wild-360 dataset**.

In the **dataset section (Section 4)**, the authors provide detailed information about the **Wild-360 dataset**. They describe it as containing 85 360° video clips with a total of about 55,000 frames. The dataset is divided into 60 clips for training and 25 clips for testing, and it includes per-frame saliency heatmap annotations. This section provides essential details about the dataset's composition and purpose.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Wild-360 dataset**. However, since the dataset is newly introduced in this paper and does not have a separate publication, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the **Wild-360 dataset** will be:
> Hsien-Tzu Cheng, Chun-Hung Chao, Jin-Dong Dong, Hao-Kai Wen, Tyng-Luh Liu, Min Sun. *Cube Padding for Weakly-Supervised Saliency Prediction in 360◦ Videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from this paper is the **Wild-360 dataset**, and I will ensure to include its full citation as part of the dataset entry.
