To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WAVENET: A GENERATIVE MODEL FOR RAW AUDIO" by Aäron van den Oord et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of WaveNet in text-to-speech and music generation, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), where the authors describe their evaluations. I will look for specific mentions of datasets used in their experiments. 

In **Section 3.1 (Multi-Speaker Speech Generation)**, the authors mention using the **English multi-speaker corpus from the CSTR voice cloning toolkit (VCTK)**, which consists of 44 hours of data from 109 different speakers. This is a clear dataset that needs to be documented.

In **Section 3.2 (Text-to-Speech)**, the authors refer to two single-speaker speech databases: one for **North American English** and another for **Mandarin Chinese**. They specify that the North American English dataset contains 24.6 hours of speech data, while the Mandarin dataset contains 34.8 hours. I will need to find the full citations for these datasets as well.

In **Section 3.3 (Music)**, the authors mention two music datasets:
1. **MagnaTagATune dataset**: This dataset consists of about 200 hours of music audio, annotated with tags describing various attributes.
2. **YouTube piano dataset**: This dataset contains about 60 hours of solo piano music obtained from YouTube videos.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

1. For the **VCTK corpus**, the citation is:
   > Yamagishi, Junichi. English multi-speaker corpus for CSTR voice cloning toolkit, 2012. URL http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jyamagis/page3/page58/page58.html.

2. For the **North American English dataset** and **Mandarin Chinese dataset**, the paper does not provide specific citations, but they are typically derived from professional speech synthesis datasets. I will note that they are used in the context of TTS systems developed by Google.

3. For the **MagnaTagATune dataset**, the citation is:
   > Law, Edith and Von Ahn, Luis. Input-agreement: a new mechanism for collecting data using human computation games. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1197–1206. ACM, 2009.

4. The **YouTube piano dataset** does not have a specific citation provided in the paper, so I will note it as a dataset obtained from YouTube videos.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
