To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring End-to-End Techniques for Low-Resource Speech Recognition" by Vladimir Bataev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used **Babel data for Turkish spontaneous speech (80 hours)**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the dataset used. They specifically mention using the **IARPA Babel Turkish Language Pack (LDC2016S10)**, which contains about 80 hours of transcribed speech for training and 10 hours for development. This is a key dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IARPA Babel dataset. The citation for this dataset is typically formatted as follows:

- For the **IARPA Babel Turkish Language Pack**, the citation is:
  > IARPA. *IARPA Babel Turkish Language Pack (LDC2016S10)*. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, PA, 2016.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus on this one. 

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and concise summary of the dataset used in the research.

After completing this process, I will have a well-documented entry for the dataset that can be used for further analysis or reference.
