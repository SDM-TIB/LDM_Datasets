To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Replicated Siamese LSTM in Ticketing System for Similarity Learning and Retrieval in Asymmetric Texts" by Pankaj Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the goal of the ticketing system and mentions the use of historical tickets, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets or provide context about the data used in their experiments. The introduction describes the ticketing system and the components of queries and historical tickets, but it does not explicitly name any datasets.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in subsection 3.1 (Industrial Dataset for Ticketing System), the authors describe their dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of 949 historical tickets, with 421 labeled pairs for training and development. This section provides valuable information about the dataset structure and its components.

The authors also provide details about the labeling of the dataset, indicating that the relatedness labels are categorized as YES, REL, and NO, which are converted into numerical scores. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's purpose and how it is utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset mentioned in the paper. Since the dataset is derived from the authors' industrial application, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. However, I will note the details provided in the paper for reference.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Industrial Dataset for Ticketing System
- **Description**: The dataset consists of 949 historical tickets, with 421 labeled pairs for training and development. Each ticket includes a subject, description, and solution, with labels indicating the relatedness of the tickets.
- **Citation**: Since this dataset is specific to the authors' work and does not have a formal citation, I will reference the paper itself as the source of the dataset information.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will include the dataset name, description, and citation details as discussed.
