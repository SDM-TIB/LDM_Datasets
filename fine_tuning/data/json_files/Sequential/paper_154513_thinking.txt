To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ShufText: A Simple Black Box Approach to Evaluate the Fragility of Text Classification Models" by Rutuja Taware et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on common text classification datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they use the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)** and **Text REtrieval Conference (TREC-6)** datasets. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and the number of samples.

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)**: This dataset consists of positive and negative movie reviews, with a total of 6,920 samples in the training set and 1,821 samples in the test set.

2. **Text REtrieval Conference (TREC-6)**: This dataset contains questions categorized into six classes: Abbreviation, Description and abstract concepts, Entities, Human beings, Locations, and Numeric values. It includes 5,452 samples in the training set and 500 samples in the test set.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)**, the citation is:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C.D., Ng, A., Potts, C. (2013). *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 1631â€“1642). Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **Text REtrieval Conference (TREC-6)**, the citation is:
  > Li, X., Roth, D. (2002). *Learning question classifiers*. In Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 2002).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited.
