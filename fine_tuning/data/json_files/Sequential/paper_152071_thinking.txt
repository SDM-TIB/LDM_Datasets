To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OBJ2TEXT: Generating Visually Descriptive Language from Object Layouts" by Xuwang Yin and Vicente Ordonez, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their approach using the **MS-COCO dataset**, which is a significant dataset in the field of image captioning.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors state that they evaluate their model on the **MS-COCO dataset**, which includes both object annotations and textual descriptions. This confirms that the MS-COCO dataset is central to their experiments.

In the **related work section**, the authors reference other datasets, such as **Flickr30K Entities** and **Visual Genome**, which provide richer annotations. However, the primary dataset used for their experiments is still the MS-COCO dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **MS-COCO dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In ECCV, pages 740–755, 2014.

2. For the **Flickr30K Entities**, the citation is:
   > Bryan A Plummer, Liwei Wang, Chris M Cervantes, Juan C Caicedo, Julia Hockenmaier, and Svetlana Lazebnik. *Flickr30k Entities: Collecting Region-to-Phrase Correspondences for Richer Image-to-Sentence Models*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 2641–2649, 2015.

3. For the **Visual Genome dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalantidis, Li-Jia Li, David A Shamma, et al. *Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1):32–73, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
