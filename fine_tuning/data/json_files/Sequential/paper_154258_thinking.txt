To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Asset Price Forecasting using Recurrent Neural Networks" by Hamed Vaheb, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions forecasting prices for **Goldman Sachs (GS)** and **General Electric (GE)**, which suggests that historical price data for these stocks is likely used as a dataset.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, specifically the **data preprocessing** subsection, where the author discusses the use of stock prices and mentions the need for data normalization. This indicates that the dataset consists of historical stock prices, but I need to confirm the exact sources or datasets used.

In the **results section**, the author discusses the performance of the model on the stock prices of GS and GE, which reinforces the idea that these stocks' historical data is the primary dataset. However, I need to look for any specific dataset names or references.

I will also check the **bibliography** for any references to datasets or sources from which the data was obtained. If the author cites specific datasets or studies that provided the data, I will need to include those citations.

After gathering this information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset. The key datasets I expect to find are:

1. **Goldman Sachs (GS) Historical Price Data**: This dataset will include daily adjusted prices for GS, which is used for forecasting.
2. **General Electric (GE) Historical Price Data**: Similar to GS, this dataset will include daily adjusted prices for GE.

I will look for the following citations in the references section:

- For **Goldman Sachs (GS)**, I will check if there is a specific source or database mentioned (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg).
- For **General Electric (GE)**, I will do the same to find the source of the historical price data.

Once I have identified the datasets and their sources, I will ensure to document them with complete citations, as this is crucial for the integrity of the research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and concise manner, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation for future reference.
