To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using BERT Encoding and Sentence-Level Language Model for Sentence Ordering" by Melika Golestani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the **ROCStories dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors discuss the datasets used. In section 4.1, they provide a detailed description of the **ROCStories dataset**. I will note the key characteristics mentioned, such as the number of stories, the average word count, and the nature of the stories (i.e., commonsense stories).

The authors describe the ROCStories dataset as follows:
- It contains **98,162 five-sentence stories** with an average word count of **50 words**.
- The dataset includes causal and temporal relationships among daily events, making it suitable for learning narrative structures.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the ROCStories dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Mostafazadeh, N., Chambers, N., He, X., Parikh, D., Batra, D., Vanderwende, L., Kohli, P., & Allen, J. (2016). A corpus and cloze evaluation for deeper understanding of commonsense stories. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (pp. 839â€“849).

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction process:
1. Identify the dataset mentioned in the abstract and introduction.
2. Confirm the dataset details in the experiments section.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
