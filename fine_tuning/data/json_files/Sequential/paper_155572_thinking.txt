To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Learning Framework for Wind Turbine Repair Action Prediction Using Alarm Sequences and Long Short Term Memory Algorithms" by Connor Walker et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research, mentioning the use of alarm sequences and repair actions. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets here.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the part where they describe the data preparation and pre-processing. The authors mention that they used data from the **Teesside OSW Farm**, which is a significant dataset for their study. They state that they received **5 years of data (from 2013 to 2018)**, including alarm data, repair actions, and maintenance procedures. This indicates that the Teesside OSW Farm dataset is crucial for their experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors present prediction accuracies for their models but do not introduce any new datasets. They primarily focus on the performance of their models using the previously mentioned dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is proprietary and anonymized, the authors do not provide a formal citation for the Teesside OSW Farm data. Instead, they acknowledge the collaboration with **EDF Energy R&D UK Centre**, which is the organization that provided the data.

Thus, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Teesside OSW Farm Dataset**: This dataset includes 5 years of alarm data, repair actions, and maintenance procedures collected from the Teesside Offshore Wind Farm, owned by EDF Energy. The data is anonymized due to confidentiality agreements.

Since there is no formal citation for the dataset, I will note the acknowledgment of EDF Energy as the source of the data.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
