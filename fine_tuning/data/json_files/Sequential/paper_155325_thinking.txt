To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PercepNet+: A Phase and SNR Aware PercepNet for Real-Time Speech Enhancement" by Xiaofeng Ge et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but the experimental setup is likely where the datasets are detailed.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention that the training data is derived from the **McGill TSP speech database** and the **NTT Multi-Lingual Speech Database for Telephonometry**. They also specify the types of noise used for training, which is important for understanding the dataset's context.

Next, I will note the evaluation datasets mentioned:

1. **VCTK test set**: This is a public dataset used for evaluation, consisting of 824 samples from 8 speakers.
2. **D-NOISE test set**: This is a simulated dataset created by the authors, consisting of 108 samples with speech data from the **WSJ0 dataset** and noise data from the RNNoise demo website.

Now, I will look for the full citations for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper. Here’s what I find:

- For the **McGill TSP speech database**, the citation is:
  > McGill University. *McGill TSP Speech Database*. Available at: http://www-mmsp.ece.mcgill.ca/Documents/Data/.

- For the **NTT Multi-Lingual Speech Database for Telephonometry**, the citation is:
  > NTT Corporation. *NTT Multi-Lingual Speech Database for Telephonometry*. Available at: https://www.ntt-at.com/product/artificial/.

- For the **VCTK test set**, the citation is:
  > C. Valentini-Botinhao, X. Wang, S. Takaki, and J. Yamagishi. *Investigating RNN-based Speech Enhancement Methods for Noise-Robust Text-to-Speech*. In Proceedings of ISCA Speech Synthesis Workshop (SSW), 2016, pp. 146–152.

- For the **WSJ0 dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. B. Paul and J. M. Baker. *The Design for the Wall Street Journal-Based CSR Corpus*. In Proceedings of Second International Conference on Spoken Language Processing (ICSLP), 1992, pp. 357–362.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
