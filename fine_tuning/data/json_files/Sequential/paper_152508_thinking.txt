To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Under the Hood: Using Diagnostic Classifiers to Investigate and Improve how Language Models Track Agreement Information" by Mario Giulianelli et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but the **data section** is likely where the authors will detail the datasets used in their experiments.

In **section 2 (Data)**, the authors describe two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Gulordava Dataset**: This dataset consists of 410 sentences with at least three tokens between the subject head and the verb. It includes original sentences and nine 'nonce' variants generated by substituting context words with random words of the same part-of-speech tag. Each sentence is annotated with the correct and incorrect verb forms, morphological features, and other relevant information.

2. **Wikipedia Dependency Corpus**: This dataset contains approximately 1.5 million annotated sentences extracted from Wikipedia, which allows for the retrieval of sentences that meet specific conditions related to subject-verb agreement. The authors mention that different subsets of this corpus are used for various experiments, and they provide a notation system to specify the subsets used.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Gulordava Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kristina Gulordava, Piotr Bojanowski, Edouard Grave, Tal Linzen, and Marco Baroni. *Colorless green recurrent networks dream hierarchically*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1195–1205, 2018.

- For the **Wikipedia Dependency Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Tal Linzen, Emmanuel Dupoux, and Yoav Goldberg. *Assessing the ability of LSTMs to learn syntax-sensitive dependencies*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 4:521–535, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
