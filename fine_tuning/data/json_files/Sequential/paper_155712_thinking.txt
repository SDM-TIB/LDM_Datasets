To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PACIFIC: Towards Proactive Conversational Question Answering over Tabular and Textual Data in Finance" by Yang Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dataset called **PACIFIC**, which is a clear indication that this dataset is central to the paper. The introduction further elaborates on PACIFIC, describing its unique features and its purpose in the context of proactive conversational question answering.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe how PACIFIC was constructed using the **TAT-QA** dataset as a foundation. This indicates that TAT-QA is also a relevant dataset to note.

In the **dataset creation section**, the authors detail how PACIFIC was built from TAT-QA, which provides context on how the datasets relate to each other. They mention that PACIFIC consists of 2,757 conversations and 19,008 QA pairs, which is important quantitative information to include.

Now, I will gather the full citations for both datasets from the **references section** of the paper:

1. **PACIFIC Dataset**: Since this dataset is introduced in the paper itself, I will cite it as follows:
   > Yang Deng, Wenqiang Lei, Wenxuan Zhang, Wai Lam, Tat-Seng Chua. *PACIFIC: Towards Proactive Conversational Question Answering over Tabular and Textual Data in Finance*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

2. **TAT-QA Dataset**: The citation for TAT-QA, which is referenced multiple times in the paper, is:
   > Fengbin Zhu, Wenqiang Lei, Youcheng Huang, Chao Wang, Shuo Zhang, Jiancheng Lv, Fuli Feng, and Tat-Seng Chua. *TAT-QA: A question answering benchmark on a hybrid of tabular and textual content in finance*. In Proceedings of the ACL/IJCNLP, pages 3277â€“3287, 2021.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **PACIFIC**: A dataset for proactive conversational question answering over hybrid contexts of tables and text, constructed from TAT-QA.
- **TAT-QA**: A benchmark dataset for question answering that combines tabular and textual data in the finance domain.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all citations are accurately represented.
