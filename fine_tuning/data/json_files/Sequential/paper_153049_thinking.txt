To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intention-aware Long Horizon Trajectory Prediction of Surrounding Vehicles using Dual LSTM Networks" by Long Xin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of predicting vehicle trajectories and the need for effective data. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Data and Training)**, where the authors are likely to describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the dataset used is from the **Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM)**, which is a significant dataset in the field of naturalistic driving studies.

The authors provide specific details about the NGSIM dataset, including its collection by the US Federal Highway Administration in 2005, the area of interest (I-80 freeway in Emeryville, California), and the characteristics of the data collected (e.g., 5000 trajectories, sampling rate of 10 Hz, etc.). This section confirms that the NGSIM dataset is the primary dataset utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NGSIM dataset. The authors reference it as follows:

- **NGSIM Dataset**:
  > US Department of Transportation, “NGSIM: Next Generation Simulation”, 2008, Available: http://www.ngsim.fhwa.dot.gov. [Accessed: June 6, 2017].

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extracted from the paper:

1. **Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM)**: This dataset contains over 5000 trajectories of individual vehicles collected on the I-80 freeway, providing detailed information about vehicle movements, which is crucial for trajectory prediction tasks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included as it is critical for proper attribution and reference.
