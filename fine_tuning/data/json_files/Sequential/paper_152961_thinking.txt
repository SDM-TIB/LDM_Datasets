To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature Extraction and Classification Based on Spatial-Spectral ConvLSTM Neural Network for Hyperspectral Images" by Wen-Shuai Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "three commonly used HSI data sets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically the part where the authors describe the datasets used. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **Indian Pines Dataset**: This dataset was captured in 1992 by the AVIRIS sensor and consists of 224 spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 20 meters per pixel. The dataset includes 10,249 pixels with ground-truth information from 16 different class labels.

2. **Salinas Valley Dataset**: Collected by the AVIRIS sensor, this dataset contains 204 spectral bands and is made up of 512 lines and 217 columns. It includes 16 ground-truth classes.

3. **University of Pavia Dataset**: Acquired by the ROSIS sensor, this dataset has 103 spectral bands and a spatial resolution of 1.3 meters per pixel. It contains 610 Ã— 340 pixels and 9 distinguishable classes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. However, in this case, the paper does not provide specific references for the datasets, as they are commonly used datasets in the field of hyperspectral imaging.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the relevant details such as the number of spectral bands, spatial resolution, and the number of classes or labels.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that I include any necessary citations or references, even if they are not explicitly provided in the paper.

This process will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness.
