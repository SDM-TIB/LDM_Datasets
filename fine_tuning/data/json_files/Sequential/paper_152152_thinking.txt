To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparison of Word Embeddings for English and Cross-Lingual Chinese Word Sense Disambiguation" by Hong Jin Kang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors provide a public dataset for benchmarking cross-lingual word sense disambiguation (WSD) for Chinese, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look into the **Methods and Datasets sections** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In the **Methods section**, the authors mention constructing an English-Chinese Cross-Lingual WSD dataset, which is a key dataset for their experiments. They describe how this dataset was created, including the hiring of human annotators and the number of instances and target words.

In the **Datasets section**, the authors provide specific details about the English-Chinese Cross-Lingual WSD dataset:
- The dataset consists of **697 instances** with **251 target words**.
- Each instance includes a single English target word, its context, and possible translations.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors reference the following key works related to their dataset:
- For the One Million Sense-Tagged Instances dataset, the citation is:
  > Taghipour, K., & Ng, H. T. (2015). One million sense-tagged instances for word sense disambiguation and induction. In CoNLL 2015, pages 338–344.

- For the dictionary used in the Cross-Lingual WSD dataset, the citation is:
  > Chen, T., Zheng, N., Zhao, Y., Chandrasekaran, M. K., & Kan, M.-Y. (2015). Interactive second language learning from news websites. In Proceedings of ACL Workshop on Natural Language Processing Techniques for Educational Applications (NLP-TEA’15), pages 34–42.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
