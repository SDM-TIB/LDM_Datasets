To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NAS-Bench-101: Towards Reproducible Neural Architecture Search" by Chris Ying et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions the introduction of **NAS-Bench-101**, which is described as the first public architecture dataset for neural architecture search (NAS) research. This indicates that the dataset is central to the paper.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets, particularly the **Datasets** or **Methodology** sections. In this paper, the dataset is elaborated upon in **Section 2 (The NASBench Dataset)**. Here, the authors describe how they constructed NAS-Bench-101, which maps neural network architectures to their training and evaluation metrics. They mention that they evaluated a large number of different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures on **CIFAR-10**.

In this section, I will note the key details about the dataset:
1. **NAS-Bench-101**: This dataset contains a table mapping 423,000 unique architectures to various metrics, including training accuracy, validation accuracy, testing accuracy, training time, and the number of trainable parameters. It allows researchers to evaluate models quickly without retraining.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset, as it is a well-known dataset used in many studies. The citation for CIFAR-10 is:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Master's thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, 2009.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

In summary, I have identified the following datasets:
1. **NAS-Bench-101**: A dataset for neural architecture search that includes 423,000 unique architectures evaluated on CIFAR-10.
   - Citation: Ying, C., Klein, A., Real, E., Christiansen, E., Murphy, K., & Hutter, F. (2019). *NAS-Bench-101: Towards Reproducible Neural Architecture Search*. Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Machine Learning, Long Beach, California, PMLR 97.

2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset used for training and evaluating the architectures in NAS-Bench-101.
   - Citation: Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Master's thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
