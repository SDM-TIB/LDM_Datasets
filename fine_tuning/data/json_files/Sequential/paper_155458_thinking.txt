To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning Based Efficient Traffic Prediction with Limited Training Data" by Sajal Saha, Anwar Haque, and Greg Sidebottom, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a "comparatively larger real-world traffic dataset for source domain prediction" and "four smaller traffic datasets collected for four particular sources and destination pairs" for target domain prediction. This suggests that there are at least five datasets to consider.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Methodology)**, specifically subsection **III-A (Dataset and Preprocessing Steps)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention:

1. **Dataset A**: This is the source domain dataset consisting of 8,563 data samples used to build the predictive model.
2. **Dataset B**: A smaller dataset with 363 data instances used for target domain prediction.
3. **Dataset C**: Another smaller dataset with 369 data instances for target domain prediction.
4. **Dataset D**: This dataset contains 358 data instances, also for target domain prediction.
5. **Dataset E**: The final smaller dataset with 365 data instances used for target domain prediction.

The paper does not provide specific names or citations for these datasets, so I will need to check the **References section** to see if any of the datasets are derived from previously published works or if they are publicly available datasets that can be cited.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the datasets are not explicitly cited with full references in the paper. However, I can infer that the datasets are likely derived from real-world telemetry data, as mentioned in the methodology. Since they are not standard datasets with established citations, I will note them as internal datasets used by the authors without specific citations.

Now, I will compile the dataset information:

1. **Dataset A**: Source domain dataset with 8,563 samples.
2. **Dataset B**: Target domain dataset with 363 samples.
3. **Dataset C**: Target domain dataset with 369 samples.
4. **Dataset D**: Target domain dataset with 358 samples.
5. **Dataset E**: Target domain dataset with 365 samples.

Since there are no formal citations for these datasets, I will document them as internal datasets used in the study without specific references.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information in a structured format, ensuring clarity on the nature of each dataset and the absence of formal citations.
