To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Neural Networks for Illiquid Alternative Asset Cash Flow Forecasting" by Tugce Karatas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and data sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the study uses cash flow data from private equity funds, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors describe their dataset in detail. They state that the data comes from **Preqin**, a well-known data provider for private equity firms. The dataset consists of the quarterly reported fund performance data of **606 North American buyout funds** with vintage years between **2000 and 2013**. This section provides specific metrics that are included in the dataset, such as capital called, distribution to paid-in (DPI), and residual value to paid-in (RVPI).

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset source. Since the dataset is derived from Preqin, I will note that Preqin is the source but will also look for any specific papers or reports that might provide a formal citation for the dataset.

The relevant details I will extract for the dataset are:

1. **Dataset Name**: Preqin North American Buyout Funds Dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset includes quarterly reported fund performance data of 606 North American buyout funds with vintage years from 2000 to 2013, containing metrics such as capital called, DPI, and RVPI.
   - **Citation**: Preqin. *Preqin Private Equity Online*. [Accessed on YYYY-MM-DD].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation. This ensures that I have accurately documented the dataset used in the research paper, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for anyone who may want to reference or utilize the dataset in their own work.
