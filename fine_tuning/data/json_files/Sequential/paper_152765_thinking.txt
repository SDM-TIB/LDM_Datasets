To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hardware-Guided Symbiotic Training for Compact, Accurate, yet Execution-Efficient LSTM" by Hongxu Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the applications of LSTM models, but I need to look for specific datasets. I will pay attention to any references to datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention two datasets:

1. **Penn Treebank (PTB) Dataset**: This dataset is used for language modeling and contains 929k, 73k, and 82k words in the training, validation, and test sets, respectively.

2. **AN4 Dataset**: This dataset is used for speech recognition and contains 948 training utterances and 130 testing utterances.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Penn Treebank Dataset**, the citation is:
> Marcus, M., Kim, G., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., MacIntyre, R., Bies, A., Ferguson, M., Katz, K., & Schasberger, B. (1994). The Penn Treebank: Annotating predicate argument structure. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Human Language Technology (pp. 114â€“119).

For the **AN4 Dataset**, the citation is:
> Acero, A. (1990). Acoustical and environmental robustness in automatic speech recognition. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
