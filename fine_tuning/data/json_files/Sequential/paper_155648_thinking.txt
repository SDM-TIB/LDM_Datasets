To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequence-to-Set Generative Models" by Longtao Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention using two e-commerce order datasets: **TMALL** and **HKTVMALL**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors provide more details about the datasets. They describe the TMALL dataset as containing 1,363 items and 100,000 training sets, while the HKTVMALL dataset contains 782 items and 200,000 training sets. This section confirms the datasets' names and provides additional context about their contents.

I will also check the **acknowledgments** section to see if there are any references to where these datasets can be accessed or any specific citations. The authors mention that the HKTVMALL dataset was provided by the HKTVmall Open Databank, which is useful for citation purposes.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper:

1. **TMALL Dataset**: 
   - Citation: 
     > TMALL. *TMALL E-commerce Platform*. Available at: https://www.tmall.com (Accessed: [insert access date]).

2. **HKTVMALL Dataset**: 
   - Citation: 
     > HKTVMALL. *HKTVMALL E-commerce Platform*. Available at: https://www.hktvmall.com (Accessed: [insert access date]).

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately represented each dataset's details and citations. This will allow me to create structured entries for each dataset, ready for further processing or review.
