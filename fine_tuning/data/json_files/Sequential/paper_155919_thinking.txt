To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Uplink and Downlink EMF Exposure: Performance Analysis and Design Insights" by Lin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the analysis of EMF exposure from base stations (BSs) and user equipment (UE), but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** for any references to datasets used in the analysis. The introduction mentions the need for scientific analysis regarding EMF exposure but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then look into the **methodology section** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for their simulations or analyses. This section may contain details about the parameters and models used, which could lead to identifying datasets.

In the **results section**, I will check for any tables or figures that might reference datasets or data sources. The authors may present results based on specific datasets, and this could be a key area to find relevant information.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find any cited datasets. If the authors refer to specific datasets in their analysis, they may provide full citations in this section.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the datasets identified along with their full citations. If no specific datasets are mentioned, I will note that as well.

Now, I will proceed with the extraction process, focusing on the sections mentioned above to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
