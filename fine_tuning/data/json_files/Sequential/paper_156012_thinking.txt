To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Soft Dynamic Time Warping for Multi-Pitch Estimation and Beyond" by Michael Krause, Christof Weiß, and Meinard Müller, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of SoftDTW in multi-pitch estimation, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of music information retrieval (MIR).

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Application to Multi-Pitch Estimation)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention using the **Schubert Winterreise Dataset (SWD)**, which provides strongly aligned annotations for all recordings. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

In **section 4.4 (Cross-Dataset Experiment)**, the authors also mention using the **MAESTRO** and **MusicNet** datasets for training, which contain strongly aligned pitch annotations. This section confirms the presence of multiple datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. For the **Schubert Winterreise Dataset (SWD)**, the citation is:
   > Christof Weiß, Frank Zalkow, Vlora Ariﬁ-Müller, Meinard Müller, Hendrik Vincent Koops, Anja Volk, and Harald Grohganz. "Schubert Winterreise dataset: A multimodal scenario for music analysis." ACM Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage (JOCCH), vol. 14, no. 2, pp. 25:1–18, 2021.

2. For the **MAESTRO dataset**, the citation is:
   > Curtis Hawthorne, Andriy Stasyuk, Adam Roberts, Ian Simon, Cheng-Zhi Anna Huang, Sander Dieleman, Erich Elsen, Jesse H. Engel, and Douglas Eck. "Enabling factorized piano music modeling and generation with the MAESTRO dataset." In Proc. Int. Conf. Learning Representations (ICLR), New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, 2019.

3. For the **MusicNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > John Thickstun, Zaïd Harchaoui, and Sham M. Kakade. "Learning features of music from scratch." In Proc. Int. Conf. Learning Representations (ICLR), Toulon, France, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
