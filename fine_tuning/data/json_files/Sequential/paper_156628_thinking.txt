To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OOVs in the Spotlight: How to Inflect them?" by Tomáš Sourada et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a large dataset of nouns in Czech and manually annotated a real-world dataset of neologisms. This suggests that there are at least two datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Czech OOV Inflection Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets they created. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **Czech OOV Inflection Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the MorfFlex morphological dictionary and is designed for rigorous evaluation in out-of-vocabulary (OOV) conditions. It includes a lemma-disjoint train-dev-test split.

2. **Test-neologisms Dataset**: This is a manually annotated dataset of neologisms in Czech, which is also used for evaluation in real-world OOV conditions.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe how they constructed these datasets, which provides additional context and validation for their use in the experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations I need to gather are:

- For the **MorfFlex morphological dictionary**, the citation is:
  > Hajič, Jan, et al. 2020. *MorfFlex CZ 2.0*. Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, LINDAT/CLARIN, Charles University.

- For the **neologisms dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kavka, Martin, and Škrabal, Michal, et al. 2018. *Čeština 2.0*. Jan Melvil Publishing.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the datasets used in the research.
