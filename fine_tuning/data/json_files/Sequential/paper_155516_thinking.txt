To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning-Based Data Storage [Vision]" by Xiang Lian and Xiaofei Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the concept of "DNN-as-a-Database" and mentions using DNNs for data storage, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine **section 7 (Experimental Evaluation for DNN-as-a-Database)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using the **TPC-H benchmark datasets** generated by the dbgen tool, specifically with scale factors of 1 and 10, leading to tables denoted as **TPC-H-F1** and **TPC-H-F10**. This indicates that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The TPC-H benchmark is a well-known dataset, and its citation is typically standardized. The citation for the TPC-H benchmark is:

- **TPC-H Benchmark**:
  > Transaction Processing Performance Council. *TPC-H Benchmark Specification*. Available at: https://www.tpc.org/tpch/

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **TPC-H-F1**: A dataset generated from the TPC-H benchmark with a scale factor of 1, resulting in a total size of approximately 1 GB.
2. **TPC-H-F10**: A dataset generated from the TPC-H benchmark with a scale factor of 10, resulting in a total size of approximately 10 GB.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
