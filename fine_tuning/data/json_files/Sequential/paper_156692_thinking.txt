To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ARDDQN: Attention Recurrent Double Deep Q-Network for UAV Coverage Path Planning and Data Harvesting" by Praveen Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of UAVs for data harvesting and coverage path planning, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the environments used for testing their proposed method. They mention two specific grid configurations for their experiments: **"Manhattan32"** and **"Urban50."** 

1. **Manhattan32**: This dataset consists of a grid of size 32 × 32 cells, with specific takeoff and landing zones, as well as no-fly zones and buildings. The paper describes the layout and the conditions under which the UAV operates in this environment.

2. **Urban50**: This dataset features a larger grid of size 50 × 50 cells, with a single takeoff and landing area surrounded by a central building and additional no-fly zones. The characteristics of this environment are also detailed in the experiments section.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that may provide authoritative sources for these environments. However, it appears that the datasets "Manhattan32" and "Urban50" are likely created for the purpose of this study and may not have external citations.

Since the paper does not provide external references for these datasets, I will document them as follows:

- For **Manhattan32**, I will note that it is a custom dataset created for the experiments in this paper.
- For **Urban50**, I will similarly note that it is also a custom dataset created for the experiments in this paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset names and descriptions, while noting that they are custom datasets created for this research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations as required.
