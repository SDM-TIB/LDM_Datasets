To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Experimental Study of Weight Initialization and Weight Inheritance Effects on Neuroevolution" by Zimeng Lyu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the study utilizes two real-world datasets for predicting time series data with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). This indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **Results section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. They describe two datasets:

1. **Coal-Fired Power Plant Dataset**: This dataset consists of data collected from 12 burners of a coal-fired power plant, containing per-minute data over a period of 10 days. The output parameter chosen for this dataset is the main flame intensity.

2. **Wind Turbine Dataset**: This dataset includes wind turbine engine data collected from 2013 to 2020, with readings taken every 10 minutes. The output parameter selected for this dataset is the average active power.

The authors also provide links to where these datasets can be accessed, which is useful for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the datasets themselves are not typically cited in the references section like traditional publications. Instead, the authors provide URLs for accessing the datasets:

- For the **Coal-Fired Power Plant Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dataset available at: [EXAMM repository](https://github.com/travisdesell/exact/tree/master/datasets/)

- For the **Wind Turbine Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dataset available at: [ENGIEâ€™s La Haute Borne open data windfarm](https://opendata-renewables.engie.com)

Since these datasets are publicly available and the authors have provided direct links, I will include these URLs as part of the dataset descriptions.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference.
