To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining Pre-trained Word Embeddings and Linguistic Features for Sequential Metaphor Identification" by Rui Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiment sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on three public metaphor datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors mention the use of three datasets: **VUA**, **MOH-X**, and **TroFi**. This is a good indication that these datasets will be elaborated upon in subsequent sections.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide a brief overview of the datasets, but I will need to look for more detailed descriptions in the **experiments section**. Here, they mention that they evaluate their model on the three datasets and provide statistics about each dataset in Table 1.

I will extract the following datasets based on the information provided in the paper:

1. **VUA (VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus)**: This dataset is described as the largest all-word annotated metaphor dataset, containing sentences sampled from the British National Corpus. It includes various genres and has been used in the NAACL-2018 Metaphor Shared Task.

2. **MOH-X**: This dataset was formed by sampling example sentences from WordNet, with metaphoricity labels agreed upon by annotators. It contains unique target verbs and is used for metaphor identification.

3. **TroFi**: This dataset consists of sentences sampled from the Wall Street Journal Corpus, where target verbs are annotated for metaphorical usage.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **VUA**, the citation is:
  > Steen, G. J., Dorst, A. G., Herrmann, J. B., Kaal, A., Krennmayr, T., & Pasma, T. (2010). *A Method for Linguistic Metaphor Identification: From MIP to MIPVU*. John Benjamins Publishing.

- For **MOH-X**, the citation is:
  > Mohammad, S. M., Turney, P. D., & Shutova, E. (2016). *Metaphor as a medium for emotion: An empirical study*. In Proceedings of the Fifth Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics, pages 23â€“33.

- For **TroFi**, the citation is:
  > Birke, J., & Sarkar, A. (2006). *A clustering approach for nearly unsupervised recognition of nonliteral language*. In 11th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
