To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VIENA2: A Driving Anticipation Dataset" by Mohammad Sadegh Aliakbarian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract introduces the VIENA2 dataset, highlighting its purpose and the number of videos it contains. This indicates that the dataset is central to the research, and I should look for detailed descriptions later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (VIENA2)**, where the authors provide an in-depth description of the dataset. Here, they mention that VIENA2 is a large-scale dataset for action anticipation in driving scenarios, covering five generic driving scenarios with a total of 25 distinct action classes. They also specify that it contains over 15,000 full HD videos, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scale and application.

I will also look for any specific mentions of other datasets in the **comparison** sections or throughout the paper. The authors compare VIENA2 with existing datasets, such as Brain4Cars and JAAD, which may require me to note these datasets as well.

In the **References section**, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors provide citations for the datasets they reference, which is essential for proper attribution. 

For the **VIENA2 dataset**, the citation is:
> Aliakbarian, M.S., Saleh, F.S., Salzmann, M., Fernando, B., Petersson, L., & Andersson, L. (2017). Encouraging LSTMs to anticipate actions very early. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

For the **Brain4Cars dataset**, the citation is:
> Jain, A., Koppula, H.S., Raghavan, B., Soh, S., & Saxena, A. (2016). Brain4Cars: Car that knows before you do via sensory-fusion deep learning architecture. arXiv preprint arXiv:1601.00740.

For the **JAAD dataset**, the citation is:
> Rasouli, A., Kotseruba, I., & Tsotsos, J.K. (2017). Agreeing to cross: How drivers and pedestrians communicate. arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.03555.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
