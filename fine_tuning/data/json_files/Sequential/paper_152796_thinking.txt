To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Emotion Classification with Word and Sentence Representations in RCNN" by Peixiang Zhong and Chunyan Miao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in **SemEval-2019 Task 3: EmoContext**, which suggests that this task involves a specific dataset for emotion detection in conversations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors describe the task of emotion detection in textual conversations. They mention that the task involves detecting emotions based on the last utterance given the context of the first two utterances. This context implies that there is a structured dataset used for this classification task.

In **section 1 (Introduction)**, the authors reference **SemEval-2019 Task 3: EmoContext** and describe the emotions involved, but I need to find specific details about the dataset used.

I will then look into **section 4 (Result Analysis)**, where the authors provide a table (Table 1) that outlines the dataset splits and the distribution of emotions across training, validation, and test sets. This table indicates that the dataset consists of:

- **Training set**: 30,160 conversations
- **Validation set**: 2,755 conversations
- **Test set**: 5,509 conversations

The emotions classified include happy, sad, angry, and others, with specific counts for each emotion in each dataset split.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset used in the SemEval-2019 Task 3. The relevant citation is:

- For **SemEval-2019 Task 3: EmoContext**, the citation is:
  > Ankush Chatterjee, Kedhar Nath Narahari, Meghana Joshi, and Puneet Agrawal. *SemEval-2019 Task 3: EmoContext: Contextual Emotion Detection in Text*. In SemEval-2019, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is the **EmoContext dataset** used in the SemEval-2019 Task 3, and I have the full citation ready for inclusion in any subsequent documentation or analysis.
