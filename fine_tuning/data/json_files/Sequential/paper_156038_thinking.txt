To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Wind Power Forecast Precision via Multi-head Attention Transformer: An Investigation on Single-step and Multi-step Forecasting" by Md Rasel Sarkar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental details sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed model is evaluated on a wind power dataset, which suggests that there is a specific dataset used for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental details section** (Section IV), where the authors describe their methodology. They mention using an "open historical dataset from Germany, which included actual measurements of wind power (Watt) generation." This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized, but I need to gather more specific details about it.

In this section, the authors state that the dataset contains "61,500 samples" and is divided into training (70%) and testing (30%). However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes.

To ensure I have the correct citation, I will check the **References section** for any mention of the dataset or related studies that might have used the same dataset. However, it appears that the dataset is not explicitly cited in the references, which means I may need to refer to the general context of wind power forecasting datasets.

Since the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset, I will note that the dataset is an open historical dataset from Germany, but I will also mention that the authors did not provide a formal citation.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format for the dataset entry:

1. **Dataset Name**: Open Historical Wind Power Dataset from Germany
   - **Description**: This dataset includes actual measurements of wind power (Watt) generation, consisting of 61,500 samples, divided into training (70%) and testing (30%).
   - **Citation**: Not explicitly cited in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare to present this information in the required format, ensuring that I highlight the lack of a formal citation for the dataset while providing as much detail as possible about its contents and structure.
