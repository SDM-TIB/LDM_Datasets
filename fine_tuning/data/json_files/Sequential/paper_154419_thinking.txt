To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Clinical Document Understanding on COVID-19 Research with Spark NLP" by Veysel Kocaman and David Talby, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract references the **COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)**, indicating that this dataset is significant to the study.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail, such as **section 4 (Analysing the CORD-19 Dataset with Pre-trained Models)**. Here, the authors describe how they utilize the CORD-19 dataset for their NLP pipeline, which confirms its importance in their research.

In the **References section**, I will search for the full citation of the CORD-19 dataset. The paper cites it as follows:
> Wang, L. L.; Lo, K.; Chandrasekhar, Y.; Reas, R.; Yang, J.; Eide, D.; Funk, K.; Kinney, R.; Liu, Z.; Merrill, W.; et al. (2020). CORD-19: The Covid-19 Open Research Dataset. ArXiv.

Since the CORD-19 dataset is the primary dataset discussed in the paper, I will ensure to document it thoroughly.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Identify the dataset mentioned in the abstract and introduction.
2. Confirm the dataset's significance in the methodology and analysis sections.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references.
4. Document the dataset with its citation for clarity and completeness.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
