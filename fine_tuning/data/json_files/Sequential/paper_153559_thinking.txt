To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Model-Driven and Data-Driven Fusion Framework for Accurate Air Quality Prediction" by Chunbo Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a dataset for forecasting air quality from January 1st, 2016, to December 31st, 2016, which suggests that there is a specific dataset being referenced.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methods and Data)**, where the authors describe the data used for their experiments. They mention that the dataset includes air quality data collected from five air quality monitoring stations in Chengdu, China, and meteorological data from the National Meteorological Information Center. This section is crucial as it provides details about the datasets used in their study.

The authors specify that the pollutant dataset includes common pollutants such as CO, NO2, SO2, and PM2.5, and they also mention the meteorological data used for bias correction, which includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and air pressure. This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites various studies and sources that may provide the necessary citations for the datasets used.

1. **Air Quality Data from Chengdu**: The authors mention that the air quality data is collected from the Environmental Protection and Research Institute of Chengdu. The citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided in the text, but I will note it as:
   > Environmental Protection and Research Institute of Chengdu. Air quality monitoring data. Chengdu, China.

2. **Meteorological Data**: The meteorological data is sourced from the National Meteorological Information Center (NMICC), China. The citation for this dataset is:
   > National Meteorological Information Center (NMICC), China. Meteorological data. Available at: http://data.cma.cn/

3. **CMAQ Model Data**: The authors mention using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model for predictions. The citation for the CMAQ model is:
   > Appel, K. W., Gilliland, A. B., Sarwar, G., & Gilliam, R. C. (2007). Evaluation of the community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) model version 4.5: Sensitivities impacting model performance: Part Iâ€”Ozone. *Atmospheric Environment*, 41(40), 9603-9615.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
