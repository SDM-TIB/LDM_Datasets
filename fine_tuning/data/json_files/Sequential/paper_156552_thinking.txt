To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physics-Informed LSTM-Based Delay Compensation Framework for Teleoperated UGVs" by Ahmad Abubakar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a novel predictor framework and mentions experiments conducted to validate its efficacy, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **Data and Preprocessing** subsection. Here, the authors describe the dataset generated from human-in-the-loop experiments involving teleoperated UGVs on soft terrains. They mention that the dataset includes motion commands and force feedback signals collected at a frequency of 10 Hz over a total simulation time of 300 seconds, comprising about 3000 acquisitions. This indicates that a specific dataset was created for their experiments.

The authors also specify that the training dataset was recorded from three trained operators, and the testing datasets were collected from different operators, maintaining the same sampling rate but for shorter durations. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets used. However, the paper does not explicitly cite external datasets but rather describes the dataset generated from their experiments. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is original and created by the authors for the purpose of this study.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Human-in-the-loop Experiment Dataset for Teleoperated UGVs
   - **Description**: This dataset includes motion commands and force feedback signals collected during experiments with teleoperated UGVs on soft terrains. It consists of data from three trained operators over a total simulation time of 300 seconds, with a sampling rate of 10 Hz.
   - **Citation**: Abubakar, A., Zweiri, Y., Haddad, A., Yakubu, M., Alhammadi, R., & Seneviratne, L. (2024). Physics-Informed LSTM-Based Delay Compensation Framework for Teleoperated UGVs. *IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
