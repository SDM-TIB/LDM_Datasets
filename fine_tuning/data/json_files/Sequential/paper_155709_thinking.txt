To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gated Recurrent Unit for Video Denoising" by Kai Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract does not specify any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for video denoising and mention various methods but do not explicitly name any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention two datasets used for their evaluations: 

1. **CRVD Dataset**: This dataset is described as a real raw video dataset captured by a SONY IMX385 sensor. It contains videos with varying ISO values, which are crucial for testing the performance of the proposed method under different lighting conditions.

2. **SRVD Dataset**: This is a synthesized dataset mentioned in the context of training and evaluation. The authors indicate that it is used alongside the CRVD dataset for fair comparisons with other methods.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **CRVD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yue, H., Cao, C., Liao, L., Chu, R., & Yang, J. (2020). Supervised Raw Video Denoising with a Benchmark Dataset on Dynamic Scenes. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), Seattle, WA, USA, pp. 2301–2310.

- For the **SRVD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, C., Chen, Q., Xu, J., & Koltun, V. (2018). Learning to See in the Dark. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), Salt Lake City, UT, USA, pp. 3291–3300.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
