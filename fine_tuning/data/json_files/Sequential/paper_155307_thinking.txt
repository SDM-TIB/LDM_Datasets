To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compositional Generalization Requires Compositional Parsers" by Pia Weißenhorn et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments and datasets**. The abstract mentions a comparison of models on the **COGS corpus**, which indicates that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference several corpora, including **COGS**, **SCAN**, and **CFQ**. I will need to focus on the details provided about these datasets, particularly in the sections that describe the experiments.

In **section 2**, the authors provide a detailed description of the **COGS dataset**, which is a synthetic semantic parsing corpus. They mention that it consists of English sentences mapped to logic-based meaning representations and that it includes 21 generalization types. This section will be crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **experiments section** (section 5) to confirm that the authors used the **COGS dataset** for their evaluations. They discuss the training and testing setups, which will help me understand how the dataset was utilized in their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The **COGS dataset** was created by Kim and Linzen in 2020, and the citation is as follows:
> Kim, Najoung, and Tal Linzen. "COGS: A compositional generalization challenge based on semantic interpretation." In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 9087–9105, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics.

The paper also references other datasets like **SCAN** and **CFQ**, but I will focus on **COGS** since it is the primary dataset discussed in the context of their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the information about the **COGS dataset** into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and concise summary of the dataset used in the research.
