To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-scale modeling of Snail-mediated response to hypoxia in tumor progression" by Giulia Chiari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used for validation or comparison. The introduction often elaborates on the context of the research and may reference specific datasets that are critical to the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, it is likely that the authors will describe the datasets used for their numerical simulations or comparisons with experimental data. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **methods** or **experiments** sections for any additional details about how the datasets were utilized in the study. This may include information on how the data was processed, any specific parameters used, or the outcomes measured.

Once I have gathered the necessary information about each dataset, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the "MCF-7 cell migration dataset," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly referenced.

By following these steps, I will be able to effectively extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or analysis.
