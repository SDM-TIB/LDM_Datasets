To extract datasets from the research paper titled "State Space LSTM Models with Particle MCMC Inference" by Xun Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction may give context about the datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about their usage in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in section 5. They mention using datasets for synthetic sequence tracking, language modeling, and user modeling. I will extract the relevant datasets from these descriptions.

1. **Synthetic Sequence Tracking Dataset**: The authors generated synthetic data for testing their model's flexibility. They created sequences based on four different dynamics (straight line, sine wave, circle, swiss roll) with added Gaussian noise. However, since this dataset is synthetic, it may not have a formal citation.

2. **Wikipedia Dataset**: For the language modeling task, the authors used a publicly available Wikipedia dataset, excluding documents with less than 500 words and retaining the most frequent 200k word types. The citation for this dataset is not provided in the paper, but it is commonly known in the research community.

3. **User Click History Dataset**: The authors used an anonymized sample of user search click history, which was anonymized to remove identifiable information. This dataset contains a vocabulary of 100K and varies the number of users from 500K to 1M. Again, a formal citation is not provided, but it is important to note that this dataset is anonymized.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for any formal citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, since the synthetic dataset does not have a citation and the other datasets are commonly used in the field, I will note that in my documentation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include any available citations or descriptions for each dataset. The goal is to provide a clear and concise summary of the datasets used in the research paper, along with proper citations where applicable.
