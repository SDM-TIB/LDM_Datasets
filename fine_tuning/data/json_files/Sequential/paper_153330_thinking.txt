To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comprehensive Abstractive Summarization With Diversified Attention Based On Determinantal Point Processes" by Lei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their models on six open datasets, which indicates that there are multiple datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide a detailed overview of the datasets used. They mention testing their model on the **CNN-DM dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for summarization tasks. They also mention five additional datasets: **NEWSROOM, TLDR, BIGPATENT, WIKIHOW, and REDDIT**.

In this section, the authors provide specific details about each dataset, including the number of documents and the types of content. I will take note of these details as they are crucial for describing each dataset accurately.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **CNN-DM Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 1693â€“1701, 2015.

2. **NEWSROOM Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Max Grusky, Mor Naaman, and Yoav Artzi. *Newsroom: A dataset of 1.3 million summaries with diverse extractive strategies*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.11283, 2018.

3. **TLDR Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Minh-Thang Luong, Hieu Pham, and Christopher D Manning. *Effective approaches to attention-based neural machine translation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1508.04025, 2015.

4. **BIGPATENT Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Eva Sharma, Chen Li, and Lu Wang. *Bigpatent: A large-scale dataset for abstractive and coherent summarization*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.03741, 2019.

5. **WIKIHOW Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Mahnaz Koupaee and William Yang Wang. *Wikihow: A large scale text summarization dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.09305, 2018.

6. **REDDIT Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Byeongchang Kim, Hyunwoo Kim, and Gunhee Kim. *Abstractive summarization of reddit posts with multi-level memory networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.00783, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its relevant details and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
