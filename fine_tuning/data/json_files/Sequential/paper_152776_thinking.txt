To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aspect Specific Opinion Expression Extraction using Attention based LSTM-CRF Network" by Abhishek Laddha and Arjun Mukherjee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors performed experiments on a **Hotel dataset from Tripadvisor.com**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They mention that they labeled a total of **10,775 sentences** from the Hotel dataset, which was split into an 80:20 ratio for training and validation. Additionally, they manually labeled another disjoint set of **1,683 sentences** for testing. This section confirms the dataset's significance and provides context for its use in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from Tripadvisor.com and the authors do not provide a formal citation for it, I will note that the dataset is based on user-generated content from that website. 

The citation for the paper itself is:
> Abhishek Laddha and Arjun Mukherjee. *Aspect Specific Opinion Expression Extraction using Attention based LSTM-CRF Network*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 627â€“637, 2016.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring to include the relevant details and the citation for the paper. 

In summary, the key dataset extracted is:
- **Hotel dataset from Tripadvisor.com**: Contains 10,775 labeled sentences for training and validation, and an additional 1,683 manually labeled sentences for testing.

I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and includes the citation for the paper, as it is essential for proper attribution and reference.
