To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporally Identity-Aware SSD with Attentional LSTM" by Xingyu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on the **ImageNet VID dataset** and the **2DMOT15 dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets in detail. In this paper, the datasets are discussed in **section IV (Experiment and Discussion)**. Here, the authors provide specific details about each dataset:

1. **ImageNet VID**: This dataset is described as the largest dataset for temporal object detection, containing 4000 videos in the training set with over 1 million frames. The authors mention that it requires algorithms to detect 30-class targets in consecutive frames.

2. **2DMOT15**: This dataset is used to evaluate tracking performance and consists of 11 training sequences. The authors note that it is a multi-object tracking dataset and provide details about how they split the data for validation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **ImageNet VID**, the citation is:
  > O. Russakovsky, J. Deng, H. Su, J. Krause, S. Satheesh, S. Ma, Z. Huang, A. Karpathy, A. Khosla, M. Bernstein, A. C. Berg, and F. Li. "ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge." *International Journal of Computer Vision*, vol. 115, no. 3, pp. 211â€“252, 2015.

- For **2DMOT15**, the citation is:
  > L. Leal-Taixe, A. Milan, I. Reid, S. Roth, and K. Schindler. "Motchallenge 2015: Towards a benchmark for multi-target tracking." *arXiv:1504.01942*, 2015.

Now that I have the dataset names and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references as required.
