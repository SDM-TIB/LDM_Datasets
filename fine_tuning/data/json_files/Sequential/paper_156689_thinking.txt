To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Off-the-Shelf Neural Network Architectures for Forex Time Series Prediction come at a Cost" by Theodoros Zafeiriou and Dimitris Kalles, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the comparison of LSTM architectures and an ANN specialized architecture for forex market prediction, which suggests that there may be datasets related to forex data.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to identify any specific datasets that are referenced. The introduction mentions the use of artificial neural networks for financial forecasting, particularly in the forex market, but does not specify any datasets yet.

Moving on to **section 3.3 (Selection of the Exchange Rate and Experimental Data Source)**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **EUR/USD exchange rate** for their experiments. They mention that the data was gathered from **TrueFx**, covering tick-to-tick exchange rates for October, November, and December 2021. This is a clear indication of the dataset used.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the TrueFx dataset. The authors reference TrueFx as a leading forex data server, but they do not provide a formal citation in the references. However, I can note that the dataset is publicly accessible through the TrueFx website.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **EUR/USD Exchange Rate Dataset**: This dataset contains tick-to-tick exchange rate values for the EUR/USD currency pair for the months of October, November, and December 2021. The dataset was pre-processed to remove flat areas where the exchange rate remained constant.

For the citation, since there is no formal paper associated with the TrueFx dataset in the references, I will note the website as the source:

- **TrueFx**: TrueFX, www.truefx.gr

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset information along with its citation.
