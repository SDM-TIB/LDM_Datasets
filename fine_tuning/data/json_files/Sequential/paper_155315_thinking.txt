To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time Series Analysis of Blockchain-Based Cryptocurrency Price Changes" by Jacques Fleischer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on using historical records of cryptocurrency prices, which suggests that datasets will be discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the use of the **yfinance** Python module to download historical prices of cryptocurrencies. This section indicates that the dataset consists of historical price data for various cryptocurrencies, but I need to clarify which specific cryptocurrencies are included.

The paper mentions that the program can analyze cryptocurrencies such as **EOS-USD**, **Bitcoin**, and **Dogecoin**. However, the primary dataset discussed in detail is the historical price data for **EOS-USD**, which is used throughout the experiments and figures.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the source of the EOS-USD data. The authors reference Yahoo Finance as the source for the historical data, which is crucial for proper citation.

The full citation for the EOS-USD dataset is:
> Yahoo Finance. [n.d.]. EOS USD (EOS-USD). https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EOS-USD/history?p=EOS-USD

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: EOS-USD Historical Price Data
   - **Description**: This dataset includes historical price data for the EOS cryptocurrency from its inception to the present day, retrieved using the yfinance Python module.
   - **Source**: Yahoo Finance.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured accurately, including the full citation for the dataset.
