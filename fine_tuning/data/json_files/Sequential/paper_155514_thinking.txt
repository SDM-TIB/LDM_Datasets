To extract datasets from the research paper titled "JNMR: Joint Non-linear Motion Regression for Video Frame Interpolation" by Meiqin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using the **Vimeo-90K Septuplet dataset** and the **BVI-DVC dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In the **Implementation Details** section, the authors explicitly state that they trained their model using the **Vimeo-90K Septuplet dataset**, which consists of 64,612 seven-frame sequences, and the **BVI-DVC dataset**, which includes 17,600 quintuplets. This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For the **Vimeo-90K Septuplet dataset**, the citation is:
   > Xue, T., Chen, B., Wu, J., Wei, D., & Freeman, W. T. (2019). Video enhancement with task-oriented flow. *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 127(8), 1106-1125.

2. For the **BVI-DVC dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ma, D., Zhang, F., & Bull, D. R. (2021). BVI-DVC: A training database for deep video compression. *IEEE Transactions on Multimedia*, 24, 3847-3858.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for any required output format or further processing.
