To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Adversarial Approach to High-Quality, Sentiment-Controlled Neural Dialogue Generation" by Xiang Kong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses related works and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**, specifically the part where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using a large corpus of tweets with emojis collected in a previous work by Zhou and Wang (2018). This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized.

In the **dataset description**, the authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of samples in the training, development, and test sets, as well as the sentiment classification scheme (positive and negative). This information is crucial for accurately describing the dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to the dataset collected by Zhou and Wang (2018), so I will locate that reference to ensure I have the complete citation.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Zhou, X., and Wang, W. Y. (2018). Mojitalk: Generating emotional responses at scale. In Proceedings of the 56th ACL. Melbourne, Victoria, Australia: ACL.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Twitter Corpus with Emojis
   - **Description**: A large corpus of tweets classified into two sentiment categories (positive and negative). The dataset contains approximately 374K tweets for training, 21K for development, and 21K for testing, with a sentiment ratio of about 3:1.
   - **Full Citation**: Zhou, X., and Wang, W. Y. (2018). Mojitalk: Generating emotional responses at scale. In Proceedings of the 56th ACL. Melbourne, Victoria, Australia: ACL.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
