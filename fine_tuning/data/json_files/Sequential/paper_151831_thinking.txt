To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Towards End-to-End Prosody Transfer for Expressive Speech Synthesis with Tacotron" by RJ Skerry-Ryan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of speech synthesis but does not mention any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets and training)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **Single-speaker dataset**: This dataset consists of high-quality English audiobook recordings by Catherine Byers, totaling 147 hours of recordings from 49 books, read in an animated and emotive storytelling style.

2. **Multi-speaker dataset**: This proprietary dataset contains 296 hours of recordings from 44 speakers, including various accents (5 Australian, 6 British, 1 Indian, 2 Singaporean, and 30 American).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are described as proprietary and specific to the authors' work, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. In this case, I will note that the datasets are proprietary and provide the details as described in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Single-speaker dataset**: 
   - Description: A high-quality English dataset of audiobook recordings by Catherine Byers, consisting of 147 hours of recordings of 49 books, read in an animated and emotive storytelling style.
   - Citation: Not available (proprietary dataset).

2. **Multi-speaker dataset**: 
   - Description: A proprietary high-quality English speech dataset consisting of 296 hours across 44 speakers (5 with Australian accents, 6 with British accents, 1 with an Indian accent, 2 with Singaporean accents, and 30 with United States accents).
   - Citation: Not available (proprietary dataset).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I clearly indicate the proprietary nature of the datasets and the absence of formal citations.
