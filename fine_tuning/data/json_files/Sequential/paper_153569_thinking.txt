To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AtomNAS: Fine-Grained End-to-End Neural Architecture Search" by Jieru Mei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **ImageNet dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** (Section 4). In this section, the authors describe their experiments and the datasets used. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

Upon reviewing Section 4.4, the authors explicitly mention using the **COCO dataset** for object detection and instance segmentation tasks. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **ImageNet Dataset**: The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Fei-Fei Li. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In CVPR, pp. 248–255, 2009.

2. **COCO Dataset**: The citation for the COCO dataset is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge J. Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: common objects in context*. In Computer Vision - ECCV 2014 - 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V, pp. 740–755, 2014.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification tasks, containing millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.
2. **COCO**: A dataset designed for object detection and instance segmentation, featuring images with complex scenes and annotations for multiple objects.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
