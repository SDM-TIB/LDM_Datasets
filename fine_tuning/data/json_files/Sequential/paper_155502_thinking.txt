To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MMTM: Multi-Tasking Multi-Decoder Transformer for Math Word Problems" by Keyur Faldu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on various Math Word Problems (MWPs) datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In section 4.3, the authors mention that they perform experiments on the **MWPS** and **ASDiv-A** datasets, and they test their model on the **SVAMP** dataset. This is a crucial step as it confirms the datasets used in their experiments.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the relevant sections. In section 4.1, the authors describe the **SVAMP challenge** dataset, noting that it is an adversarial dataset designed to test the model's generalizability, comprising 1000 math word problems. This section provides context for the dataset's purpose and structure.

In section 4.2, the authors mention the **MWPS** dataset, which consists of 2737 math word problems, and in section 4.3, they describe **ASDiv-A** as a subset of ASDiv with 1218 MWPs focused on arithmetic operations. This information is essential for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets:

- For **MWPS**, the citation is:
  > Koncel-Kedziorski, R., Roy, S., Amini, A., Kushman, N., & Hajishirzi, H. (2016). *MAWPS: A Math Word Problem Repository*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 1152–1157.

- For **ASDiv-A**, the citation is:
  > Huang, D., Shi, S., Lin, C.-Y., & Yin, J. (2016). *How well do computers solve math word problems? Large-scale dataset construction and evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 887–896.

- For **SVAMP**, the citation is:
  > Patel, A., Bhattamishra, S., & Goyal, N. (2021). *Are NLP models really able to solve simple math word problems?* arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.07191.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
