To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Modularity Comparison of Long Short-Term Memory and Morphognosis Neural Networks" by Thomas E. Portegys, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of two neural network architectures on maze tasks, which suggests that there may be datasets related to maze navigation.

Next, I will focus on the **description section**, particularly the subsection titled "Mazes." Here, the author outlines the maze learning tasks and the types of mazes used, which indicates that the mazes themselves may be considered datasets for the experiments. The paper describes three types of generated training sequences: door associations, context mazes, and independent mazes. I will note these as potential datasets.

In the **results section**, the author discusses the performance of the LSTM and Morphognosis networks on various maze configurations, but does not provide specific dataset names or citations. Therefore, I will need to infer that the datasets used for training and testing are the mazes described earlier.

Now, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might pertain to the maze datasets or methodologies used in the experiments. The references include various studies on maze learning and neural networks, but they do not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the maze datasets, I will create a general entry for the datasets based on the information provided:

1. **Maze Learning Dataset**: This dataset consists of various maze configurations used for training and testing the neural networks. It includes door associations, context mazes, and independent mazes, which are generated for the experiments.

2. **Morphognosis Maze Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Morphognosis model, which has been used to simulate various tasks, including maze navigation. While specific citations for the maze datasets are not provided, the author references previous works that describe the Morphognosis model.

Since there are no formal citations for the maze datasets, I will note that the datasets are based on the author's own implementations and methodologies described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I clearly indicate the nature of the datasets and their relevance to the experiments conducted in the study.
