To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Effective Batching for Recurrent Neural Network Grammars" by Hiroshi Noji and Yohei Oseki, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the syntactic generalization performance based on "the large training data of 100M tokens from English Wikipedia" and "the broad-coverage targeted syntactic evaluation benchmark." This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors refer to the **BLLIP corpus** and **English Wikipedia** as the datasets used for training and evaluation. 

1. **BLLIP Corpus**: The authors mention using the BLLIP corpus, which consists of 42 million tokens for training and 1,500 sentences for development. This dataset is used to evaluate the performance of their model.

2. **English Wikipedia**: The authors also mention training their RNNG on approximately 100 million tokens from English Wikipedia, which is used to assess the syntactic generalization abilities of their model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **BLLIP corpus**, the citation is:
  > Eugene Charniak, Don Blaheta, Niyu Ge, Keith Hall, John Hale, and Mark Johnson. *BLLIP 1987-89 WSJ Corpus Release 1 LDC2000T43*. Linguistic Data Consortium, 2000.

- For the **English Wikipedia**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, it is common to reference the dataset as follows:
  > English Wikipedia. Available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **BLLIP Corpus**: A dataset consisting of 42 million tokens used for training and 1,500 sentences for development.
2. **English Wikipedia**: A large dataset containing approximately 100 million tokens used for training the RNNG.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete for future reference or processing.
