To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Short-term probabilistic photovoltaic power forecast based on deep convolutional long short-term memory network and kernel density estimation" by Mingliang Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using actual measured PV power data, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), where the authors describe the data used for their study. They mention that the data consists of actual measured PV power data collected from a photovoltaic power station in Belgium, covering the period from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2015, with a temporal resolution of 15 minutes. This section provides key details about the dataset, including the monitored capacity of the PV power station (2915.88 MWp) and the number of data points collected.

I will also check the **data description subsection (3.1)** for any additional details about the dataset. Here, the authors specify that they selected PV data from 5:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. each day, resulting in 60 samples per day after excluding nighttime data. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that the data can be downloaded from a specific website, which is a key piece of information for citation purposes.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Elia. *Solar PV Power Generation Data*. Available at: https://www.elia.be/en/grid-data/power-generation/solar-pv-power-generation-data.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the name, description, and citation, into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details about the dataset used in the research paper.
