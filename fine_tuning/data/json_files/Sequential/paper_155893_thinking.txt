To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parameterizing the cost function of Dynamic Time Warping with application to time series classification" by Matthieu Herrmann, Chang Wei Tan, and Geoffrey I. Webb, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimentation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimentation)**, as this section often details the datasets used for experiments. Here, the authors mention that they evaluated their method on the **UCR time series classification benchmark**, which is a well-known collection of datasets for time series classification tasks. This indicates that the UCR archive is a primary dataset used in their experiments.

In **section 4.1 (Analysis of the impact of exponent selection on accuracy)**, the authors refer to "109 datasets" from the UCR archive, confirming that they utilized multiple datasets for their analysis. However, they do not list the specific datasets in this section.

To find the full citations for the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The authors cite the UCR Time Series Classification Archive, which is a comprehensive source for the datasets they used. The citation for the UCR archive is as follows:

- **UCR Time Series Classification Archive**:
  > Dau HA, Keogh E, Kamgar K, Yeh CCM, Zhu Y, Gharghabi S, Ratanamahatana CA, Yanping, Hu B, Begum N, Bagnall A, Mueen A, Batista G, Hexagon-ML (2018) The UCR Time Series Classification Archive. 

Since the paper does not specify individual datasets from the UCR archive, I will note that the datasets used are part of this archive, which contains a variety of time series datasets for classification tasks.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the UCR archive as the source of the datasets used in the experiments. This will provide a clear reference for anyone looking to access the datasets mentioned in the paper.
