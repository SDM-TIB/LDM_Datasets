To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Hand-object 3D Reconstruction from a Single Image with Cross-branch Feature Fusion" by Yujin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on public datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified. The introduction may provide additional context or names of these datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** within the paper, which is often where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this case, the relevant section is **Section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets they evaluated their method on.

In Section IV-A, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **ObMan Dataset**: This is described as a large-scale synthetic dataset containing hand-object images generated through the MANO model and sampled from the ShapeNet dataset. It includes 141K training frames and 6K test frames, providing RGB-D images, 3D hand and object meshes, and 3D hand keypoints.

2. **First-Person Hand Action Benchmark Dataset (FHB)**: This dataset collects RGB-D video sequences of daily hand action categories with hand-object interaction. A subset named FHBc is used, containing around 5K frames for training and 5.6K frames for testing.

3. **Hands in Action Dataset (HIC)**: This dataset includes sequences where a hand interacts with an object, specifically using frames where the hand is close to the object. The authors utilize specific sequences for training and evaluation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **ObMan Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Hasson, G. Varol, D. Tzionas, I. Kalevatykh, M. J. Black, I. Laptev, and C. Schmid. *Learning joint reconstruction of hands and manipulated objects*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 11 807–11 816, 2019.

- For the **First-Person Hand Action Benchmark Dataset (FHB)**, the citation is:
  > G. Garcia-Hernando, S. Yuan, S. Baek, and T.-K. Kim. *First-person hand action benchmark with RGB-D videos and 3D hand pose annotations*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 409–419, 2018.

- For the **Hands in Action Dataset (HIC)**, the citation is:
  > D. Tzionas, L. Ballan, A. Srikantha, P. Aponte, M. Pollefeys, and J. Gall. *Capturing hands in action using discriminative salient points and physics simulation*. International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 118, no. 2, pp. 172–193, 2016.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately along with its full citation for clarity and proper referencing.
