To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Racist Text in Bengali: An Ensemble Deep Learning Framework" by S. S. Saruar Jahan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors built a novel dataset in the Bengali language, which suggests that there is a specific dataset they created for their research.

Next, I will look into the **Data Acquisition** section, specifically **section IV**, where the authors describe their data collection process. They mention collecting 6,000 raw data samples from social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. This indicates that the dataset is derived from real-world social media comments, which is crucial for understanding the context of the dataset.

In the same section, the authors discuss the **annotation process**, where they annotated the dataset for multiclass targets, identifying three types of racism in the Bengali language. This further confirms the dataset's focus and its relevance to the study.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, since the dataset is novel and created by the authors, it may not have an external citation. Instead, I will note that the dataset is available on GitHub, as mentioned in the paper.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Corpora Racism Dataset**: This dataset consists of 6,000 annotated comments collected from social media platforms, categorized into three types of racism: Representational, Ideological, and Discursive. The dataset is open-sourced and available on GitHub.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as described in the paper. Since the dataset is novel and created by the authors, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> S. S. Saruar Jahan, Nusrat Jahan, Sadia Rahman Priota. *Detecting Racist Text in Bengali: An Ensemble Deep Learning Framework*. In Proceedings of the 2023 26th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT), 13-15 December, Coxâ€™s Bazar, Bangladesh.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
