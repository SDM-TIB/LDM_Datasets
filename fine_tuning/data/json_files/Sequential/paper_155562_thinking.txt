To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diverse Dance Synthesis via Keyframes with Transformer Controllers" by Junjun Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors verify their approach on a dance dataset containing a wide range of contemporary dance. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved, but I need to find its specific name and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors refer to a dance dataset that they use for their experiments. They mention that the dataset comes from a specific source, which is crucial for citation purposes.

In **section 3.1**, the authors state that the dance dataset they use comes from a reference labeled as [dat, AZS∗17]. This is a clear indication that the dataset is documented elsewhere, and I need to find the full citation for this reference in the **References section**.

Upon reviewing the **References section**, I find the following citation for the dataset:

- **Dance Dataset**: 
  > Aristidou A., Zeng Q., Stavrakis E., Yin K., Cohen-Or D., Chrysanthou Y., Chen B. (2017). *Emotion control of unstructured dance movements*. In Proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH / Eurographics Symposium on Computer Animation (Los Angeles, CA, USA, 2017), Eurographics Association / ACM, pp. 9:1–9:10.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dance Dataset**: The paper utilizes a dance dataset that contains a variety of contemporary dance movements. The dataset is referenced as coming from the work by Aristidou et al. (2017).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
