To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MultiWave: Multiresolution Deep Architectures through Wavelet Decomposition for Multivariate Time Series Prediction" by Iman Deznabi and Madalina Fiterau, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their models on three publicly available datasets, which suggests that I should look for specific names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors describe the applications of their model. They mention three specific applications: stress and affect detection, COVID-19 mortality prediction, and human activity recognition. This gives me a clear direction to look for the datasets associated with these applications.

In the **Data and Code Availability** section, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Wearable Stress and Affect Detection (WESAD)**: This dataset is referenced with a citation to Schmidt et al. (2018). It includes physiological response data collected from 15 subjects during various sessions.

2. **COVID-19 Dataset**: The authors refer to a dataset provided by Yan et al. (2020), which contains biomarkers collected from patient blood samples for predicting in-hospital mortality.

3. **MHEALTH Dataset**: This dataset is cited as Banos et al. (2014, 2015) and includes wearable sensor data from volunteers performing different physical activities.

Next, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For **WESAD**, the citation is:
  > Philip Schmidt, Attila Reiss, Robert Duerichen, Claus Marberger, and Kristof Van Laerhoven. *Introducing WESAD, a multimodal dataset for wearable stress and affect detection*. In Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on multimodal interaction, pages 400–408, 2018.

- For the **COVID-19 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li Yan, Hai-Tao Zhang, Jorge Goncalves, Yang Xiao, Maolin Wang, Yuqi Guo, Chuan Sun, Xiuchuan Tang, Liang Jing, Mingyang Zhang, et al. *An interpretable mortality prediction model for covid-19 patients*. Nature machine intelligence, 2(5):283–288, 2020.

- For the **MHEALTH Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Oresti Banos, Rafael Garcia, Juan A Holgado-Terriza, Miguel Damas, Hector Pomares, Ignacio Rojas, Alejandro Saez, and Claudia Villalonga. *mhealthdroid: a novel framework for agile development of mobile health applications*. In Ambient Assisted Living and Daily Activities: 6th International Work-Conference, IWAAL 2014, Belfast, UK, December 2-5, 2014. Proceedings 6, pages 91–98. Springer, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Wearable Stress and Affect Detection (WESAD)**: A dataset for stress and affect detection from physiological data.
   - Citation: Schmidt et al. (2018)

2. **COVID-19 Dataset**: A dataset for predicting in-hospital mortality based on biomarkers.
   - Citation: Yan et al. (2020)

3. **MHEALTH Dataset**: A dataset for human activity recognition using wearable sensors.
   - Citation: Banos et al. (2014, 2015)

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
