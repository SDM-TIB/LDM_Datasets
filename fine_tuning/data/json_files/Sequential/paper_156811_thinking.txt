To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Cognitive Workload Classification Using Integrated LSTM Layers and CNNs for fNIRS Data Analysis" by Mehshan Ahmed Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on fNIRS data, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of fNIRS for cognitive load assessment and mention the **Tufts fNIRS dataset** as a publicly available resource. This indicates that the dataset is relevant to their research.

Next, I will check the **methodology and experiments sections** for more details about the dataset. In the experiments section, the authors explicitly state that they employed the **Tufts fNIRS open-access dataset**. They describe the dataset as encompassing fNIRS data from 68 participants engaged in various n-back tasks, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's context.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the Tufts fNIRS dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- **Tufts fNIRS Dataset**:
  > Huang, Z. et al. *The Tufts fNIRS mental workload dataset & benchmark for brain-computer interfaces that generalize*. (2021).

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Tufts fNIRS Dataset**: This dataset includes fNIRS data from 68 participants performing controlled n-back tasks (0-back, 1-back, 2-back, and 3-back). It captures temporal traces of current intensity and phase changes at two wavelengths (690 and 830 nm), with preprocessing steps to mitigate artifacts.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution.
