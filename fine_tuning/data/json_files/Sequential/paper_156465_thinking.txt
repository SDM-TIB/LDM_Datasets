To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty Quantification in Machine Learning for Joint Speaker Diarization and Identification" by Simon W. McKnight et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental design sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of modulation spectrum features and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients in experiments, but it does not specify datasets yet.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Experimental Design and Results)**, particularly the subsection **B (Datasets and Ground Truth Labels)**. Here, the authors explicitly state that they used the **AMI Corpus** for their experiments. They describe how the corpus was utilized, specifying that they used the ES2008 headset recordings for their experiments, which involved four meetings with the same four speakers.

I will note the details provided about the AMI Corpus, including how the ground truth labels were constructed from the segments and words XML files. This section provides essential information about the dataset's structure and its relevance to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the AMI Corpus in the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the AMI Corpus is as follows:
> J. Carletta et al., “The AMI meeting corpus: a pre-announcement,” in Proc. of the 2nd Int. Workshop on Mach. Learning for Multimodal Interaction (MLMI’05), 2006, pp. 28–39.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the AMI Corpus, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
