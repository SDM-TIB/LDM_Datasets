To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multilingual Text-to-Speech Synthesis for Turkic Languages Using Transliteration" by Rustem Yeshpanov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a TTS system for ten Turkic languages and mentions the use of a specific dataset, **KazakhTTS2**, which is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experimental setup** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss the **KazakhTTS2** corpus in detail, describing it as a large-scale and open-source speech corpus that consists of over 270 hours of high-quality transcribed data. This is a key dataset for their work.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **KazakhTTS2** dataset. The relevant citation is:
> S. Mussakhojayeva, Y. Khassanov, and H. A. Varol. "KazakhTTS2: Extending the Open-Source Kazakh TTS Corpus With More Data, Speakers, and Topics." In LREC. ELRA, 2022, pp. 5404â€“5411. Available: https://aclanthology.org/2022.lrec-1.578

Additionally, I will verify if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to various Turkic languages, but they primarily focus on the **KazakhTTS2** dataset for their experiments. There are no other datasets explicitly named or described in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **KazakhTTS2** dataset. This will allow for easy reference and ensure that the dataset can be properly attributed in future work.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is **KazakhTTS2**, and I have confirmed its details and citation. I will now prepare to present this information in the required format for further processing or review.
