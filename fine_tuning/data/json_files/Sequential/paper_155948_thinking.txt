To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Imputing Knowledge Tracing Data with Subject-Based Training via LSTM Variational Autoencoders Frameworks" by Jia Tracy Shen and Dongwon Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenge of missing data in Knowledge Tracing (KT) and hints at the use of existing datasets. The introduction elaborates on the need for datasets with subject descriptors, indicating that the authors are using specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. They state that they are using two private multivariate KT datasets from the K12.com platform:

1. **Grade 10 Geometry Course Dataset (Geom)**: This dataset contains quiz answering data with an average sequence length of 150 time steps, including 11 temporal features and 7 subject descriptors. It has a total of 3,265 students and 412,397 observed instances.

2. **Grade 11 Algebra II Dataset (Alg2)**: Similar to the Geom dataset, this dataset also has an average sequence length of 150 time steps, with the same number of features and descriptors. It includes 2,110 students and 277,548 observed instances.

The authors provide detailed statistics about the datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are private and specific to the K12.com platform, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. The authors do not provide external references for these datasets, so I will note that they are proprietary datasets from K12.com.

Finally, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics. Since the datasets are proprietary, I will indicate that they are from K12.com without a formal citation.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **Grade 10 Geometry Course Dataset (Geom)**: Contains quiz answering data with 3,265 students and 412,397 observed instances.
2. **Grade 11 Algebra II Dataset (Alg2)**: Contains quiz answering data with 2,110 students and 277,548 observed instances.

Both datasets are proprietary and sourced from K12.com, with no formal citations available. I will ensure to present this information clearly in the final output.
