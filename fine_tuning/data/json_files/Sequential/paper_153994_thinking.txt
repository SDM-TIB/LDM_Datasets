To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Reliable Real-Time Opera Tracking: Combining Alignment with Audio Event Detectors to Increase Robustness" by Charles Brazier and Gerhard Widmer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the tracking of complex polyphonic music, specifically mentioning a live performance of a Mozart opera, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this performance.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data Description)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they produced their own dataset for systematic experiments with opera score following, specifically using the opera "Don Giovanni" by W.A. Mozart. 

The paper describes two recordings:
1. **Target Recording**: A live performance at the Vienna State Opera in November 2018, conducted by Ádám Fischer. This recording is approximately 4 hours long and serves as the target for tracking.
2. **Reference Recording**: A CD recording by Herbert von Karajan from 1985, which is used as a reference for alignment. 

The authors also mention that they manually annotated both recordings with time markers at bar boundaries, resulting in 5304 bar annotations for the target performance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these recordings. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the recordings themselves, as they are likely proprietary or unpublished materials. Instead, I will note the details provided in the text.

The details I will extract for the datasets are:
1. **Dataset Name**: Don Giovanni Live Performance
   - **Description**: A live recording of the opera "Don Giovanni" performed at the Vienna State Opera in November 2018, annotated with 5304 bar boundaries.
   - **Citation**: Not available (proprietary recording).

2. **Dataset Name**: Don Giovanni Reference Recording
   - **Description**: A CD recording of "Don Giovanni" conducted by Herbert von Karajan from 1985, used as a reference for alignment.
   - **Citation**: Not available (proprietary recording).

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for these datasets, I will note that they are internal recordings and may not have publicly available citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I clearly indicate the proprietary nature of the recordings and the lack of formal citations.
