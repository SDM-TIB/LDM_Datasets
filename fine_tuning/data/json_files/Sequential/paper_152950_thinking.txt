To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Machine Translation with Recurrent Highway Networks" by Maulik Parmar and V. Susheela Devi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **IWSLT English-Vietnamese dataset**, which indicates that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will delve into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide more details about the dataset. They specify that the **IWSLT English-Vietnamese dataset** consists of 133,000 sentence pairs for training, and they also mention the specific subsets used for development and testing: 'tst2012' and 'tst2013'.

In **section 5.1 (Dataset details)**, the authors confirm that the dataset is available at the Stanford NLP web page, which is crucial for citing the dataset correctly.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IWSLT dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the IWSLT dataset itself. Therefore, I will refer to the general citation for the IWSLT dataset, which is commonly known in the field.

The citation for the IWSLT dataset is:
> Cettolo, M., Girardi, C., & Federico, M. (2012). *WIT3: Web Inventory of Transcribed and Translated Talks*. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT), pages 192â€“199.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will prepare to compile this information into the required format for further processing.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Confirm the dataset details in the experiments section.
3. Locate the full citation for the dataset, ensuring it is accurate and complete.

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entry as needed.
