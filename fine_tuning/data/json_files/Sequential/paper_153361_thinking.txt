To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReNAS: Relativistic Evaluation of Neural Architecture Search" by Yixing Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on the **NAS-Bench-101** and **NAS-Bench-201** datasets, indicating that these are key datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to gather more details about these datasets. In the experiments, the authors describe how they utilize the **NAS-Bench-101** dataset, which contains over 423,000 unique CNN architectures and their corresponding training, validation, and test accuracies on the CIFAR-10 dataset. They also mention the **NAS-Bench-201** dataset, which includes 15,625 different architectures and their accuracies on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-16-120 datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **NAS-Bench-101**, the citation is:
   > Chris Ying, Aaron Klein, Esteban Real, Eric Christiansen, Kevin Murphy, and Frank Hutter. *NAS-Bench-101: Towards Reproducible Neural Architecture Search*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.09635, 2019.

2. For **NAS-Bench-201**, the citation is:
   > Xuanyi Dong and Yi Yang. *NAS-Bench-201: Extending the Scope of Reproducible Neural Architecture Search*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.00326, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that they are ready for review or downstream processing.
