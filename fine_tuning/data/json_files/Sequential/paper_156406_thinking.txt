To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Which AI Technique Is Better to Classify Requirements? An Experiment with SVM, LSTM, and ChatGPT" by Abdelkarim El-Hajjami et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the study is based on five different datasets, which indicates that I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methodology)**, specifically the subsection titled **2.2 (The Datasets)**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets they used for their experiments. They mention that they had access to five public requirements datasets, which are:

1. **PROMISE**: This dataset contains 625 requirements.
2. **Dronology**: This dataset contains 97 requirements.
3. **ReqView**: This dataset contains 87 requirements.
4. **Leeds Library**: This dataset contains 85 requirements.
5. **WASP**: This dataset contains 62 requirements.

The paper also provides a summary table (Table 1) that outlines the number of requirements and their distribution among the four classes (IsFunctional, IsQuality, OnlyFunctional, OnlyQuality) for each dataset. This information is crucial for understanding the context in which these datasets were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper cites Dalpiaz et al. (2019) as the source for the datasets used in their experiments. Therefore, I will use the following citation for all datasets since they are derived from the same source:

- For **PROMISE, Dronology, ReqView, Leeds Library, and WASP**, the citation is:
  > F. Dalpiaz, D. Dell’Anna, F. B. Aydemir, S. Çevikol. *Requirements classification with interpretable machine learning and dependency parsing*. In Proceedings of the 2019 IEEE 27th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE), IEEE, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, which is essential for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
