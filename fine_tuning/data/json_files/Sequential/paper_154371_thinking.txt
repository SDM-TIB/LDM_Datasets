To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Deep Neural Networks with Morphological Information" by Matej Klemen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions using three tasks available in many less-resourced languages, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **Section 3 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets for the three tasks: named entity recognition (NER), dependency parsing (DP), and comment filtering (CF).

In **3.1 (Named Entity Recognition)**, the authors list datasets in 11 languages, including:
- **Estonian NER corpus**: Cited as Tkachenko et al., 2013.
- **FiNER data**: Cited as Ruokolainen et al., 2019.
- **ARA ANERCorp**: Cited as Benajiba et al., 2007.
- **ZHO MSRA**: Cited as Levow, 2006.
- **HRV hr500k**: Cited as Ljubešić et al., 2018.
- **ENG CoNLL-2003 NER**: Cited as Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003.
- **Other datasets for Estonian, Finnish, Korean, Latvian, Russian, Slovene, and Swedish**.

In **3.2 (Dependency Parsing)**, the authors mention datasets in 16 languages, including:
- **Universal Dependencies**: Cited as Nivre et al., 2020, which contains various annotated texts.

In **3.3 (Comment Filtering)**, the authors summarize datasets used for comment filtering in several languages, including:
- **OffensEval 2020**: Cited as Zampieri et al., 2020.
- **Jigsaw toxic comments**: Cited as Wulczyn et al., 2017.
- **Korean hate speech dataset**: Cited as Moon et al., 2020.
- **IMSyPP-sl dataset**: Cited as Evkoski et al., 2021.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to ensure I have the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper documentation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
