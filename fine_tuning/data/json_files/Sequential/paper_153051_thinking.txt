To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Multi-task Approach for Named Entity Recognition in Social Media Data" by Gustavo Aguilar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved notable results in the 3rd Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text (WNUT-2017), which suggests that there may be a specific dataset associated with this shared task.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experimental settings** sections. In this paper, the authors refer to the dataset used for their experiments as being provided by Derczynski et al. (2017), which indicates that this is a key dataset for their work.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation is:

- For the dataset used in the WNUT-2017 shared task, the citation is:
  > Leon Derczynski, Eric Nichols, Marieke van Erp, and Nut Limsopatham. *Results of the WNUT2017 Shared Task on Novel and Emerging Entity Recognition*. In Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Noisy, User-generated Text (W-NUT) at EMNLP, 2017.

Since the paper does not mention any additional datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the WNUT-2017 dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the WNUT-2017 dataset, ensuring that it is clear and complete for any future use or analysis.
