To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Hybrid and Ensemble Models for Multiclass Prediction of Mental Health Status on Social Media" by Sourabh Zanwar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors report experiments predicting six mental health conditions from Reddit posts, which suggests that datasets derived from Reddit are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their work. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Self-Reported Mental Health Diagnoses (SMHD) dataset**: This dataset is constructed from Reddit posts and includes users with nine mental health conditions. The authors explain the methodology for obtaining user-level MHC labels through distantly supervised labeling processes.

2. **Dreaddit dataset**: This dataset consists of lengthy social media posts from Reddit, categorized into stressful and non-stressful text. The authors describe how binary labels were obtained from crowdsourced human annotators.

In the **results section**, the authors provide statistics about the datasets, confirming their relevance and usage in the experiments. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SMHD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cohan, A., Desmet, B., Yates, A., Soldaini, L., MacAvaney, S., & Goharian, N. (2018). SMHD: a large-scale resource for exploring online language usage for multiple mental health conditions. In Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **Dreaddit dataset**, the citation is:
  > Turcan, E., & McKeown, K. (2019). Dreaddit: A Reddit dataset for stress analysis in social media. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Workshop on Health Text Mining and Information Analysis (LOUHI 2019), pages 97â€“107. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
