To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Embedded Feature Selection in LSTM Networks with Multi-Objective Evolutionary Ensemble Learning for Time Series Forecasting" by Raquel Espinosa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experimental evaluations on air quality time series data from Italy and southeast Spain, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for detailed information about each dataset, including the number of instances, attributes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant for understanding their use in the study.

The paper mentions two datasets:

1. **Italian City Air Quality Dataset**: This dataset contains hourly air quality data with 12 attributes and 1000 instances, collected between February 21, 2005, and April 4, 2005. The target attribute for prediction is NOx.

2. **Lorca Air Quality Dataset**: This dataset consists of daily air quality measurements from a monitoring station in Lorca, Spain, with 10 attributes and 1000 instances, collected from April 7, 2019, to December 31, 2021. The target attribute for prediction is NO2.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The Italian City Air Quality Dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, while the Lorca dataset is provided by the Consejería de Medio Ambiente, Mar Menor, Universidades e Investigación.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Italian City Air Quality Dataset**:
  > UCI Machine Learning Repository. *Air Quality Data Set*. Available at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality (Accessed: 2023).

- For the **Lorca Air Quality Dataset**:
  > Consejería de Medio Ambiente, Mar Menor, Universidades e Investigación. *Air Quality Measurements in Lorca*. Available at: https://sinqlair.carm.es/calidadaire/ (Accessed: 2023).

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
