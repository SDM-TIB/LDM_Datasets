To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RBPGAN: Recurrent Back-Projection GAN for Video Super Resolution" by Marwah Sulaiman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of various datasets for evaluation, which indicates that I should find specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. They mention using **Vimeo-90k** and a dataset referred to as **VimeoTecoGAN** for training, and **Vid4** and **Tears of Steel (ToS3)** for testing. This section provides a clear overview of the datasets utilized in their research.

Now, I will gather more details about each dataset mentioned:

1. **Vimeo-90k**: This dataset is commonly used for video super-resolution tasks and consists of a large number of high-quality video clips. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset.

2. **VimeoTecoGAN**: This dataset is created by the publishers of TecoGAN and is used for training. I will also need to find its citation.

3. **Vid4**: This dataset is a well-known benchmark for video super-resolution, and I will look for its citation.

4. **Tears of Steel (ToS3)**: This dataset is used for testing and consists of specific scenes. I will find the citation for this dataset as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Vimeo-90k**, the citation is:
  > X. Wang, R. Girshick, A. Gupta, and K. He. *Non-local Neural Networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 7794–7803, 2018.

- For **VimeoTecoGAN**, the citation is:
  > M. Chu, Y. Xie, L. Leal-Taixé, and N. Thuerey. *Temporally Coherent GANs for Video Super-Resolution*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.09393, 2018.

- For **Vid4**, the citation is:
  > X. Wang, K. C. K. Chan, K. Yu, C. Dong, and C. C. Loy. *EDVR: Video Restoration with Enhanced Deformable Convolutional Networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1954–1963, 2019.

- For **Tears of Steel (ToS3)**, the citation is:
  > Tears of Steel. *Tears of Steel: A Short Film by the Blender Institute*. Available at: https://peach.blender.org/.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
