To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MRC-LSTM: A Hybrid Approach of Multi-scale Residual CNN and LSTM to Predict Bitcoin Price" by Qiutong Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves predicting Bitcoin prices using a novel model, which suggests that there may be datasets related to Bitcoin price and possibly other cryptocurrencies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the data collection and preprocessing. Here, they mention that the dataset includes the daily closing price of Bitcoin along with various internal and external factors affecting its price. Specifically, they state that the dataset spans from **October 25, 2015, to October 17, 2020**, and contains **1820 records**.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail the attributes of the dataset, which include:
- Internal information: daily transaction data of Bitcoin (open price, close price, highest price, lowest price, weighted price, volume in BTC, volume in currency).
- External information: macroeconomic variables (S&P 500 Index, GVZ, VIX) and investor attention (Google Trends).

This indicates that the dataset is comprehensive and includes multiple features relevant to Bitcoin price prediction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are primarily derived from publicly available sources (like Bitcoin trading data and Google Trends), I will note the sources used for data collection rather than formal citations.

1. **Bitcoin Trading Data**: The authors mention that the internal data is collected from the official Bitcoin charts website. The citation for this source is:
   > BitcoinCharts. *Bitcoin Charts*. Available at: https://bitcoincharts.com

2. **Macroeconomic Variables**: The external factors are sourced from the Wind Database. The citation for this source is:
   > Wind Database. *Wind Financial Terminal*. Available at: [Wind Database URL]

3. **Google Trends**: The authors utilize Google Trends data for investor attention. The citation for this source is:
   > Google Trends. *Google Trends*. Available at: https://trends.google.com

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
