To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine learning for exoplanet detection in high-contrast spectroscopy" by R. Nath-Ranga et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's aims and methods, which may include references to datasets used for training or testing.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (From 4D IFS tensors to cross-correlation tensors)**, where the authors describe the data processing steps. Here, they mention using a dataset obtained on **HD 179218 with the SINFONI instrument**. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

In **section 2.1 (Observations and data calibration)**, the authors detail the calibration process and the characteristics of the dataset, including the absence of known companions and the specifics of the spectral cubes. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in the study.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results and discussion sections**. The authors may refer to other datasets or simulations used to validate their findings, which could be important for a comprehensive dataset extraction.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. For the dataset obtained on HD 179218, the citation is as follows:
- For the **SINFONI dataset**:
  > Bonnet, H., Conzelmann, R., Delabre, B., et al. 2004, in Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) Conference Series, Vol. 5490, Advancements in Adaptive Optics, ed. D. Bonaccini Calia, B. L. Ellerbroek, & R. Ragazzoni, 130â€“138.

Next, I will check the references section for any additional datasets or relevant studies that may have been cited, especially those related to the BT-SETTL models used for simulating young gas giants. The citation for the BT-SETTL models is:
- For the **BT-SETTL models**:
  > Allard, F., Hauschildt, P. H., Alexander, D. R., & Starrfield, S. 1997, ARA&A, 35, 137.

After gathering all relevant information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
