To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Organizational Cybersecurity Risk: A Deep Learning Approach" by Benjamin Ampel, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a "manually labeled gold-standard test dataset" is used for evaluation, which suggests that there is a specific dataset that needs to be detailed.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Research Design)**, particularly the **Data Collection** and **Pre-Processing** subsections. Here, the author describes the collection of posts from eleven prominent international hacker forums, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's origin. The paper states that a total of **85,272 exploit source code snippets** were collected from **8,412,832 posts**. This indicates a significant dataset that is central to the research.

In the **Pre-Processing** subsection, the author mentions the creation of a **gold-standard testing dataset** with specific organizational bins and counts. This dataset is detailed in **Table III**, which lists the bin labels and their respective counts. The bins include categories like "Databases," "Software," "Open Source," "Mobile," and "Video Games," with a total of **5,210 entries**.

Now, I will look for full citations for these datasets in the **References section**. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but it references the DTL-EL tool for exploit labeling, which is crucial for understanding how the dataset was constructed. The citation for this tool is:

- Ampel, B. M., Samtani, S., Zhu, H., Ullman, S., & Chen, H. (2020). *Labeling Hacker Exploits for Proactive Cyber Threat Intelligence: A Deep Transfer Learning Approach*. 2020 IEEE Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI), no. November, 2020.

Additionally, I will note that the dataset is derived from hacker forums, but since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself, I will focus on the DTL-EL tool citation as the primary reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant details about the dataset, such as its size, features, and the citation for the labeling tool used to create it. This will ensure that the dataset extraction is thorough and properly documented.
