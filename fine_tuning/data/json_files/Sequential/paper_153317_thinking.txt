To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Spoken Speech Enhancement using EEG" by Gautam Krishna et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the context of speech enhancement but does not name any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Design of Experiments for Building Training and Test Set)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Data set A**: This dataset consists of simultaneous speech and EEG recordings from 10 subjects, recorded in the absence of externally created background noise. The authors note that there was a background noise of 40 dB due to lab ventilation, but they consider the dataset as clean for the study.

2. **Data set B**: This dataset includes simultaneous speech and EEG recordings from 8 subjects, recorded in the presence of external background noise of 65 dB. The authors clarify that five subjects participated in both experiments for Data sets A and B.

Since the datasets are referred to as "Data set A" and "Data set B," I need to find the original sources or references for these datasets to provide full citations. The authors reference another paper ([8]) that likely contains the details about these datasets.

I will check the **References section** to find the citation for the paper referenced as [8]. The citation is:

> G. Krishna, C. Tran, M. Carnahan, and A. Tewfik. "Advancing speech recognition with no speech or with noisy speech," in 2019 27th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO). IEEE, 2019.

This citation will serve as the authoritative source for both Data set A and Data set B, as they are derived from the same study.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as required. The datasets will be described as follows:

- **Data set A**: Simultaneous speech and EEG recordings from 10 subjects, recorded without external background noise (40 dB lab ventilation noise considered negligible).
- **Data set B**: Simultaneous speech and EEG recordings from 8 subjects, recorded with external background noise (65 dB).

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are correctly formatted and ready for inclusion in any further documentation or processing.
