To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Efficient and Effective Second-Order Training Algorithm For LSTM-based Adaptive Learning" by N. Mert Vural, Salih Erg√ºt, and Suleyman S. Kozat, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, specifically in the **experiments section**. I will note down the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, dimensions, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the "kin8nm" dataset, I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to search for it in external sources or databases to ensure I have the correct and complete citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are formatted correctly according to the relevant citation style used in the paper, whether it be APA, IEEE, or another format.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the research paper effectively.
