To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The role of context in neural pitch accent detection in English" by Elizabeth Nielsen, Mark Steedman, and Sharon Goldwater, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **Boston University Radio News Corpus (BURNC)** for evaluating the model's performance, which indicates that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **Data and experimental setup** section (section 3) in detail, as it is likely to contain more information about the dataset used. Here, the authors describe the BURNC dataset, noting that it consists of approximately 2.75 hours of speech from trained radio journalists, with specific details about the number of utterances and word tokens. This confirms that BURNC is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the BURNC dataset. The paper provides a link to the dataset, which is crucial for proper citation. The citation for the BURNC dataset is:

> Boston University Radio News Corpus (BURNC). Available at: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC96S36.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on BURNC for my dataset extraction.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will involve summarizing the key details about the dataset, such as its purpose, size, and the context in which it was used in the research.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for BURNC, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
