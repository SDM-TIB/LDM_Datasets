To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Effective LSTMs for Target-Dependent Sentiment Classification" by Duyu Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions evaluating methods on a benchmark dataset from Twitter, which indicates that a dataset is indeed used. I will note this down as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors describe their experimental settings. Here, they mention using a benchmark dataset from Dong et al. (2014) for their experiments. This is a crucial detail, as it specifies the dataset used for evaluation.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the benchmark dataset from Twitter, the citation is:
  > Dong, L., Wei, F., Tan, C., Tang, D., Zhou, M., & Xu, K. (2014). Adaptive recursive neural network for target-dependent twitter sentiment classification. In ACL, pages 49â€“54.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Twitter Benchmark Dataset**: This dataset is used for target-dependent sentiment classification, containing labeled sentiment polarity for various sentences.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
