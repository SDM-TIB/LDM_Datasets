To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Short-Term Electricity Load Forecasting Using the Temporal Fusion Transformer: Effect of Grid Hierarchies and Data Sources" by Felix Haag et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study evaluates the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) across different time horizons and network levels, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Performance Evaluation)** and **appendix A.1 (Datasets)**. In section 4, the authors mention using two datasets for their evaluation:

1. **DE Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from a local grid operator in central Germany and covers the years 2019-2021. It consists of hourly smart meter data from 9,455 households connected to 70 substations.

2. **US Dataset**: This dataset is from the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012 (GEFCâ€™12) and includes data from 20 grid zones in the U.S. for the years 2004-2007.

I will then confirm the details of these datasets by reviewing the **appendix A.1**, where the authors provide additional context and processing steps for both datasets. This will help me ensure that I have accurate descriptions of the datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **DE Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is derived from a local grid operator, which may not have a formal citation. However, I will note the dataset's origin and timeframe.

- For the **US Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tao Hong, Pierre Pinson, and Shu Fan. "Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012." *International Journal of Forecasting*, 30(2), 357-363, 2014. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2013.07.001

After compiling this information, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This will prepare me for the final output, which will include structured entries for each dataset.
