To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Copying and Restricted Generation for Paraphrase" by Chuwei Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two different paraphrase datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two specific tasks: one-sentence abstractive summarization and text simplification. They state that they built datasets for both tasks based on existing work.

1. **One-sentence Abstractive Summarization Dataset**: The authors modified a corpus used for passage-based question answering, which includes news documents and corresponding highlights from CNN and Daily Mail. This dataset is crucial for their summarization task.

2. **Text Simplification Dataset**: The authors refer to the Simple English Wikipedia articles as the dataset for text simplification. They mention that this dataset was built according to aligned articles from traditional English Wikipedia, which is significant for their simplification task.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **One-sentence Abstractive Summarization Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hermann, K. M., Kocisky, T., Grefenstette, E., Espeholt, L., Kay, W., Suleyman, M., & Blunsom, P. (2015). Teaching machines to read and comprehend. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, 1693–1701.

- For the **Text Simplification Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kauchak, D. (2013). Improving text simplification language modeling using unsimplified text data. In *ACL (1)*, 1537–1546.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
