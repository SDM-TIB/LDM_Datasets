To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Arabic Text Sentiment Analysis: Reinforcing Human-Performed Surveys with Wider Topic Analysis" by Latifah Almuqren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the analysis of existing Arabic sentiment analysis (ASA) studies and the identification of common themes, which suggests that datasets may be referenced.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of Arabic sentiment analysis and the need for more datasets, particularly for Arabic tweets and dialects. This indicates that there may be specific datasets mentioned later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors describe their literature search and the datasets they analyzed. They mention that they manually reviewed 133 ASA papers and performed an automatic analysis on 2,297 ASA publications. However, I need to look for specific datasets used in these studies.

In the **results section**, the authors provide insights into the datasets used in the reviewed studies. They mention several datasets, including:

1. **AraCust**: A Saudi Telecom Tweets Corpus for Sentiment Analysis, which is referenced in their previous work.
2. **OCA (Opinion Corpus for Arabic)**: One of the oldest corpora for ASA, comprising more than 500 Arabic movie reviews.
3. **MADAR Corpus**: A corpus that includes 12,000 sentences from Basic Traveling Expression Corpus (BTEC) translated into various Arabic dialects.
4. **Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB)**: A well-known dataset consisting of 350,000 words of newswire text.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional datasets mentioned. The paper includes a comparison of Arabic lexicons and corpora, which may provide further details on datasets relevant to ASA.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **AraCust**: 
   > Almuqren, L., & Cristea, A. I. (2021). AraCust: A Saudi Telecom Tweets Corpus for Sentiment Analysis. *PeerJ*.

2. **OCA (Opinion Corpus for Arabic)**: 
   > Diab, M., Hacioglu, K., & Jurafsky, D. (2007). Opinion Corpus for Arabic. In *Proceedings of the NEMLAR Conference on Arabic Language Resources and Tools*.

3. **MADAR Corpus**: 
   > Maamouri, M., et al. (2006). Developing and Using a Pilot Dialectal Arabic Treebank. In *Proceedings of the LREC Conference*.

4. **Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB)**: 
   > Maamouri, M., et al. (2004). The Penn Arabic Treebank: Building a Large-Scale Annotated Arabic Corpus. In *Proceedings of the NEMLAR Conference on Arabic Language Resources and Tools*.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are structured appropriately for any required output format, ready for further processing or review.
