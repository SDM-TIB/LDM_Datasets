To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-time interactive sequence generation and control with Recurrent Neural Network ensembles" by Memo Akten and Mick Grierson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of RNNs for sequence generation but does not specify datasets. The introduction provides context about RNNs and LSTMs but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Training data)**, where the authors describe the training data used for their ensemble of LSTM networks. They mention various unique styles of text that were used as training corpora. The specific datasets mentioned include:

1. **Works of Shakespeare**: A collection of texts from Shakespeare's plays and sonnets.
2. **Baudelaire**: Texts from the works of Charles Baudelaire, a French poet.
3. **Nietzsche**: Texts from the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, a German philosopher.
4. **Jane Austen**: Texts from the novels of Jane Austen, an English novelist.
5. **Donald Trump speeches**: Transcripts of speeches made by Donald Trump.
6. **King James Bible**: The text of the King James Version of the Bible.
7. **Assorted love song lyrics**: A collection of lyrics from various love songs.
8. **Linux kernel C code**: Source code from the Linux kernel.
9. **LATEX source**: Text from LATEX documents.
10. **Chilcot Report of the Iraq Inquiry**: A report on the Iraq War.

The authors note that the amount of training data varies for each corpus, ranging from 500KB to 10MB, but they do not provide specific citations for these datasets.

Since the datasets are derived from well-known works and documents, I will look for authoritative citations for each of these sources in the **References section** or through external sources. Here are the citations I will compile:

1. **Works of Shakespeare**:
   > Shakespeare, W. *The Complete Works of William Shakespeare*. Various editions available.

2. **Baudelaire**:
   > Baudelaire, C. *Les Fleurs du mal*. Various editions available.

3. **Nietzsche**:
   > Nietzsche, F. *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*. Various editions available.

4. **Jane Austen**:
   > Austen, J. *Pride and Prejudice*. Various editions available.

5. **Donald Trump speeches**:
   > Various sources compile transcripts of Donald Trump's speeches, e.g., *The American Presidency Project*.

6. **King James Bible**:
   > The Holy Bible, King James Version. Various editions available.

7. **Assorted love song lyrics**:
   > Various sources compile lyrics, e.g., *Genius.com* or *AZLyrics.com*.

8. **Linux kernel C code**:
   > Torvalds, L. *Linux Kernel Source Code*. Available at kernel.org.

9. **LATEX source**:
   > Leslie Lamport. *LATEX: A Document Preparation System*. Addison-Wesley, 1986.

10. **Chilcot Report of the Iraq Inquiry**:
   > The Iraq Inquiry. *The Report of the Iraq Inquiry*. Available at gov.uk.

Now, I will compile these datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
