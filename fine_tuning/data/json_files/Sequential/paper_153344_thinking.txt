To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatiotemporal Co-attention Recurrent Neural Networks for Human-Skeleton Motion Prediction" by Xiangbo Shu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conduct experiments on human motion prediction, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of human motion analysis and mention that they focus on human motion prediction based on observed skeleton motion sequences. This indicates that they likely utilize specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly state that they use the **H3.6M mocap dataset (H3.6M)** for their experiments. They describe it as the largest available human-skeleton motion dataset, which includes 15 actions performed by seven different actors, with each action recorded in multiple sequences.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the H3.6M dataset is as follows:
> C. Ionescu, D. Papava, V. Olaru, and C. Sminchisescu. "Human3.6m: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3D human sensing in natural environments." *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, vol. 36, no. 7, pp. 1325â€“1339, 2014.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **H3.6M mocap dataset**: This dataset is described as the largest available human-skeleton motion dataset, capturing 15 actions performed by seven different actors, with each action recorded in two video sequences containing 3000 to 5000 frames. The dataset records the 3D locations of 32 joints at each frame, but the authors focus on 17 representative joints for their experiments.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
