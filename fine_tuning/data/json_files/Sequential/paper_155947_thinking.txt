To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequential Query Encoding for Complex Query Answering on Knowledge Graphs" by Jiaxin Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several knowledge graphs, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the evaluation settings and the knowledge graphs used for their experiments. Here, they mention three specific knowledge graphs:

1. **FB15k**: This dataset is described as containing 14,951 entities and 1,345 relations, with a total of 592,213 edges. It is a well-known benchmark for knowledge graph completion tasks.

2. **FB15k-237**: This is a subset of FB15k, containing 14,505 entities and 237 relations, with 310,079 edges. It is designed to reduce the overlap of training and testing data, making it a more challenging benchmark.

3. **NELL (Never-Ending Language Learner)**: This dataset includes 63,361 entities and 200 relations, with a total of 142,804 edges. It is used for evaluating knowledge graph reasoning capabilities.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **FB15k**, the citation is:
  > Kurt D. Bollacker, Colin Evans, Praveen K. Paritosh, Tim Sturge, and Jamie Taylor. *Freebase: a collaboratively created graph database for structuring human knowledge*. In Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, SIGMOD 2008, pages 1247â€“1250, 2008. doi: 10.1145/1376616.1376746.

- For **FB15k-237**, the citation is:
  > Andrew Carlson, Justin Betteridge, Bryan Kisiel, Burr Settles, Estevam R. Hruschka Jr., and Tom M. Mitchell. *Toward an architecture for never-ending language learning*. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI 2010, pages 11-15, 2010.

- For **NELL**, the citation is:
  > Andrew Carlson, Justin Betteridge, Bryan Kisiel, Burr Settles, Estevam R. Hruschka Jr., and Tom M. Mitchell. *Toward an architecture for never-ending language learning*. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI 2010, pages 11-15, 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
