To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coarse Temporal Attention Network (CTA-Net) for Driver’s Activity Recognition" by Zachary Wharton et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model is evaluated on **four publicly accessible datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and evaluation metric)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **Drive&Act Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale video dataset containing over 9.6 million frames, with annotations for various driver activities across multiple classes.

2. **Distracted Driver V1 Dataset**: This dataset includes 12,977 training and 4,331 testing images from 31 drivers, with 10 activity classes.

3. **Distracted Driver V2 Dataset**: An updated version of V1, this dataset contains 14,478 images from 44 drivers, also with 10 activity classes.

4. **SBU Kinect Interaction Dataset**: This dataset consists of 282 videos with 8 different activity classes, used to demonstrate the model's applicability to traditional human activities.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will cross-reference the **References section** of the paper to obtain the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Drive&Act Dataset**, the citation is:

- For **Distracted Driver V1 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yehya Abouelnaga, Hesham M Eraqi, and Mohamed N Moustafa. *Real-time distracted driver posture classification*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.09498, 2017.

- For **Distracted Driver V2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hesham M Eraqi, Yehya Abouelnaga, Mohamed H Saad, and Mohamed N Moustafa. *Driver distraction identification with an ensemble of convolutional neural networks*. Journal of Advanced Transportation, 2019.

- For **SBU Kinect Interaction Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details regarding the datasets used in the research.
