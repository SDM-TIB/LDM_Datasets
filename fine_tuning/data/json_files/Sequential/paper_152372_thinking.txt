To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Are You Talking to a Machine? Dataset and Methods for Multilingual Image Question Answering" by Haoyuan Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a **Freestyle Multilingual Image Question Answering (FM-IQA) dataset** to train and evaluate their model, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (The Freestyle Multilingual Image Question Answering (FM-IQA) Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They mention that the FM-IQA dataset contains **158,392 images** and **316,193 Chinese question-answer pairs** along with their English translations. This section will likely contain the necessary details about the dataset's structure, purpose, and how it was created.

In this section, I will also find the URL to the project page where the dataset is available: **http://idl.baidu.com/FM-IQA.html**. This is important for providing access to the dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset or the foundational datasets used to create it. The authors mention that the FM-IQA dataset is based on the **MS COCO dataset**, which is a well-known dataset in the field. I will need to include the citation for the MS COCO dataset as well.

The citation for the MS COCO dataset is:
> T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1405.0312, 2014.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for both the FM-IQA dataset and the MS COCO dataset.

The final entries will be:

1. **FM-IQA Dataset**:
   - Description: A large-scale dataset containing 158,392 images with 316,193 Chinese question-answer pairs and their English translations.
   - Citation: Gao, H., Mao, J., Zhou, J., Huang, Z., Wang, L., & Xu, W. (2023). *Are You Talking to a Machine? Dataset and Methods for Multilingual Image Question Answering*. Available at: http://idl.baidu.com/FM-IQA.html.

2. **MS COCO Dataset**:
   - Description: A dataset that provides a large-scale collection of images with annotations for various tasks, including object detection and image captioning.
   - Citation: Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1405.0312.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare it for output in the required format for further processing or review.
