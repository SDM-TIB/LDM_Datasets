To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neurally Augmented ALISTA" by Freya Behrens, Jonathan Sauder, and Peter Jung, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced or implied. The abstract discusses the introduction of Neurally Augmented ALISTA and its performance improvements, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the generation of sparse vectors and the use of specific measurement matrices. They mention that the support of the target vector \( x^* \) is determined via i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables, but they do not specify a named dataset. Instead, they describe the process of generating data for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous works or methodologies that the authors have built upon. This could provide insights into the datasets that are relevant to their research.

After reviewing these sections, I will summarize the findings regarding datasets. If no specific datasets are named, I will note that the authors generated synthetic data for their experiments, which is common in theoretical research. In this case, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets since they are not explicitly mentioned.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to retrieve their full citations from the references section. For example, if they referenced datasets like the MNIST or CIFAR-10, I would look up the appropriate citations for those datasets.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, if applicable. If no datasets are explicitly mentioned, I will document that as well, indicating that the experiments were conducted using synthetic data generated by the authors.

In summary, my steps will include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for any dataset mentions.
2. Analyzing the experiments section for detailed dataset information.
3. Checking the references for any cited datasets.
4. Compiling the findings into a structured summary with full citations where applicable.
