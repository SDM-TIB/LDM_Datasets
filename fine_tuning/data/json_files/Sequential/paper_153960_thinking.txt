To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Stock Predictions" by Akash Doshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not list datasets explicitly, it sets the context for what is being analyzed.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Dataset & Data Pre-Processing)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention predicting stock prices for four companies in the automobile industry: Ford, GM, Toyota, and Tesla. They specify the timeframes for the stock price data for each company, which is crucial for understanding the datasets.

The paper states that the stock price data was sourced from the **Capital IQ database by Compustat through a Wharton WRDS subscription**. This indicates that the dataset is derived from a commercial database, which is important to note.

I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Ford Stock Price Dataset**: Contains daily stock prices from 1983 to 2020, including daily open, close, low, and high prices.
2. **GM Stock Price Dataset**: Contains daily stock prices from 1985 to 2020, including daily open, close, low, and high prices.
3. **Toyota Stock Price Dataset**: Contains daily stock prices from 1980 to 2020, including daily open, close, low, and high prices.
4. **Tesla Stock Price Dataset**: Contains daily stock prices from 2010 to 2020, including daily open, close, low, and high prices.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the Capital IQ database and any other relevant sources mentioned in the dataset description. The citation for the Capital IQ database is:

- **Capital IQ Database**: 
  > Carissa Holler Phillips. 2012. S&P Capital IQ. *Journal of Business & Finance Librarianship*, 17(3), 279â€“286.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their sources, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare to present this information in the required format for further processing or review.
