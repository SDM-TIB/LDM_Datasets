To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building Task-Oriented Visual Dialog Systems Through Alternative Optimization Between Dialog Policy and Language Generation" by Mingyang Zhou, Josh Arnold, and Zhou Yu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the framework on the **GuessWhich task**, which suggests that there may be a dataset associated with this task.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any specific references to datasets. The authors discuss various image guessing tasks, including **GuessWhich** and **GuessWhat**, indicating that these tasks likely involve datasets. However, I need to find explicit mentions of datasets and their details.

In the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1**, the authors describe the **AI-AI Image Guessing Game** and mention that their conversational agent interacts with a pool of **9,628 test images**. This indicates that there is a dataset used for testing, but I need to confirm its source and citation.

I will also look for any references to datasets in the **related work** section, where the authors cite previous works that may have used similar datasets. For instance, they mention the **VisDial Dataset**, which is crucial for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **VisDial Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Abhishek Das, Satwik Kottur, Khushi Gupta, Avi Singh, Deshraj Yadav, JosÂ´e M.F. Moura, Devi Parikh, and Dhruv Batra. *Visual Dialog*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

2. **GuessWhich Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Prithvijit Chattopadhyay, Deshraj Yadav, Viraj Prabhu, Arjun Chandrasekaran, Abhishek Das, Stefan Lee, Dhruv Batra, and Devi Parikh. *Evaluating visual conversational agents via cooperative human-ai games*. CoRR, abs/1708.05122, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
