To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Emotion Modelling in Written Stories" by Lukas Christ et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce continuous valence and arousal annotations for an existing dataset of children's stories, which suggests that there is a specific dataset being referenced.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using the **children's story dataset created by Alm**. I will need to gather details about this dataset, including its size, structure, and any modifications made by the authors.

In the **data section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the children's story dataset, including the number of sentences, stories, and the emotional labels used. They mention that the dataset comprises 176 stories from three authors: the Brothers Grimm, Hans-Christian Andersen, and Beatrix Potter. Each sentence in the dataset is annotated with emotions experienced by the primary character and the overall mood.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the original dataset. The authors refer to Alm's work, which is crucial for providing the correct citation. The citation for the children's story dataset is:

- Alm, E. C. O. (2008). *Affect in Text and Speech*. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Additionally, I will note that the authors have extended the annotations and created a continuous valence/arousal gold standard, which is an important aspect of their contribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I follow the required format for clarity and completeness.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing all necessary details for future reference or analysis.
