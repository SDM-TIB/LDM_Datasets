To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Spatial-Temporal Clues in a Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Video Classification" by Zuxuan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that may be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two popular benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look specifically at **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they describe:

1. **UCF-101 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 13,320 video clips across 101 human action classes, totaling 27 hours of video. The authors mention that they follow a specific evaluation protocol involving three train/test splits.

2. **Columbia Consumer Videos (CCV) Dataset**: This dataset contains 9,317 YouTube videos annotated with 20 classes, primarily focusing on events like "basketball," "graduation ceremony," and "birthday party." The authors specify the training and testing splits used for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **UCF-101 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > K. Soomro, A. R. Zamir, and M. Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. CoRR, 2012.

- For the **Columbia Consumer Videos (CCV) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y.-G. Jiang, G. Ye, S.-F. Chang, D. Ellis, and A. C. Loui. *Consumer video understanding: A benchmark database and an evaluation of human and machine performance*. In ACM ICMR, 2011.

Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets along with their full citations, which is crucial for any downstream processing or review.
