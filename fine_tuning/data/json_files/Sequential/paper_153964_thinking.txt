To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dance Revolution: Long-Term Dance Generation with Music via Curriculum Learning" by Ruozi Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to gather initial information about any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors collected a high-quality dataset consisting of 1-minute video clips, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset Collection and Preprocessing)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they collected. They state that they collected **790 one-minute clips of pose data** with a total duration of about 12 hours, categorized into three styles: "Ballet," "Hiphop," and "Japanese Pop." This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the dataset's composition.

In this section, the authors also mention the use of **OpenPose** for human pose estimation, which indicates the methodology used to extract pose data from the videos. This is important for understanding the dataset's context but does not constitute a separate dataset.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to their dataset as being collected from YouTube videos, but they do not provide a formal citation for it. However, they do mention that the dataset is available with their code, which suggests that it may be accessible for further use.

Since the dataset is original and created by the authors, I will document it as follows:

1. **Dance Dataset**: This dataset consists of 790 one-minute clips of dance movements, categorized into three styles: "Ballet," "Hiphop," and "Japanese Pop." The dataset is designed for long-term dance generation with music and is available through the authors' code repository.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the citation for the dataset as follows:

- For the **Dance Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ruozi Huang, Huang Hu, Wei Wu, Kei Sawada, Mi Zhang, Daxin Jiang. *Dance Revolution: Long-Term Dance Generation with Music via Curriculum Learning*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that the citation is clear and complete.
