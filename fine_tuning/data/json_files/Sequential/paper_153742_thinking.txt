To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficiently Calibrating Cable-Driven Surgical Robots with RGBD Fiducial Sensing and Recurrent Neural Networks" by Minho Hwang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for calibration and evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Method)**, where the authors describe their data collection process. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets they created or used. The authors mention collecting two specific datasets:

1. **Random motions (Drand)**: This dataset consists of randomly sampled configurations of the robot, with 4000 data points collected over 66 minutes.

2. **Pick and place motions (Dpick)**: This dataset consists of horizontal and vertical motions, specifically for the peg transfer task, with 1800 data points collected over 31 minutes.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used for evaluation and to gather any additional context about their application.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are original contributions of the authors and do not have external citations.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples and the context in which they were collected.

Finally, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation (even if it is an internal reference). 

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
