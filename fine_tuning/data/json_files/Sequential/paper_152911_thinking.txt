To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Language Modeling through Long Term Memory Network" by Anupiya Nugaliyadde et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that the Long Term Memory network (LTM) is tested on the **Penn Treebank dataset** and **Text8 dataset**, which indicates that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look into the **experimentation section** (Section IV) where the authors provide more details about the datasets. They describe the **Penn Treebank dataset** as containing 2,499 stories from the Wall Street Journal in raw text format, and the **Text8 dataset** as containing over 240,000 Wikipedia articles. This confirms that both datasets are used for evaluating the LTM model.

I will also check the **results section** (Section V) to see if there are any additional details about the datasets that might be relevant. The authors mention the training, validation, and testing sizes for both datasets, which helps in understanding their structure and usage.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Penn Treebank dataset**, the citation is:
> Taylor, A., Marcus, M., & Santorini, B. (2003). The Penn Treebank: An Overview. In Treebanks (pp. 5–22). Springer.

For the **Text8 dataset**, the citation is:
> Mikolov, T., Karafiát, M., Burget, L., Cernocký, J., & Khudanpur, S. (2010). Recurrent Neural Network Based Language Model. In Eleventh Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association.

With this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
