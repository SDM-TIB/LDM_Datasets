To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning To Score Olympic Events" by Paritosh Parmar and Brendan Tran Morris, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses action quality assessment in Olympic sports, which suggests that datasets related to these sports may be included.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors mention the limited availability of action quality datasets and reference the MIT Diving Quality dataset. This indicates that there are specific datasets being utilized in their research.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation. The authors describe three datasets:

1. **UNLV-Dive Dataset**: This dataset is an extension of the original MIT Diving dataset, which has been increased from 159 samples to 370 samples by including dives from the 2012 Olympics. The dataset is used to assess the quality of diving performances.

2. **MIT-Skate Dataset**: This dataset includes annotations for figure skating performances, which consist of presentation, technical, and final scores. The authors mention that they used 100 samples for training and 71 for testing.

3. **UNLV-Vault Dataset**: A new dataset consisting of 176 samples for gymnastic vault scoring. The authors describe how the final score is calculated based on execution and difficulty values.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **MIT Diving Quality Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Pirsiavash, C. Vondrick, and A. Torralba. *Assessing the quality of actions*. In Computer Vision - ECCV 2014 - 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part VI, pages 556–571, 2014.

- For the **MIT-Skate Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Pirsiavash, C. Vondrick, and A. Torralba. *Assessing the quality of actions*. In Computer Vision - ECCV 2014 - 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part VI, pages 556–571, 2014. (Note: The same citation is used as it is referenced in the context of figure skating.)

- For the **UNLV-Vault Dataset**, since it is newly introduced in this paper, I will cite it as:
  > Paritosh Parmar and Brendan Tran Morris. *Learning To Score Olympic Events*. University of Nevada, Las Vegas, 2023.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that all information is accurately captured and ready for further processing or review.
