To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer Language Models with LSTM-Based Cross-Utterance Information Representation" by G. Sun, C. Zhang, and P. C. Woodland, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed system was evaluated on specific datasets, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data Sets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, I will look for detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this section, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **AMI Meeting Corpus**: This dataset consists of 80 hours of data from 137 meetings with 3â€“5 speakers per meeting, recorded by independent headset microphones. It includes reference transcriptions with about 0.9 million words used for language model training.

2. **Switchboard (SWB) Telephone Conversational Transcription Task**: The SWB dataset is described as having around 27 million words from 14,107 telephone conversations, with the acoustic model training set containing approximately 300 hours of audio.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The full citations for the datasets are:

- For the **AMI Meeting Corpus**:
  > J. Carletta, S. Ashby, S. Bourban, M. Flynn, M. Guillemot, T. Hain, J. Kadlec, V. Karaiskos, W. Kraaij, M. Kronenthal, G. Lathoud, M. Lincoln, A. Lisowska, I. McCowan, W. Post, D. Reidsma & P. Wellner. *The AMI meeting corpus: A pre-announcement*. In Proceedings of the MLMI, Bethesda, 2006.

- For the **Switchboard (SWB) Dataset**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, it is commonly referenced as:
  > Godfrey, J. J., Holliman, E. C., & McDaniel, J. (1992). *SWB: The Switchboard telephone speech corpus*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 1992.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
