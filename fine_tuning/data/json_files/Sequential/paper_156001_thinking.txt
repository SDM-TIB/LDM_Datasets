To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Artificial Dendritic Computation: The case for dendrites in neuromorphic circuits" by D. J. Mannion and A. J. Kenyon, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I need to look for specific datasets in the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors discuss the task of sound localization and the dataset used for this task. In the text, they mention that the dataset consists of artificial audio pulses, specifically two copies of a 440Hz sinewave pulse generated with a width of 10ms, with one pulse artificially delayed to simulate the timing differences experienced by the left and right ears. They also note that noise is added to these signals, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

The authors specify that the dataset includes three delays: 0, 5, and 10ms. This information is essential for accurately describing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **bibliography section** to find any references that might provide full citations for datasets or related works. However, since this dataset appears to be generated by the authors for their specific experiments, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets.

Since the dataset is described in detail, I will summarize it as follows:

1. **Artificial Audio Pulses Dataset**: This dataset consists of two copies of a 440Hz sinewave pulse, each with a width of 10ms. One pulse is delayed to simulate the timing differences between the left and right ears, with three specific delays (0, 5, and 10ms). The dataset also includes noise to resemble real-world conditions.

As this dataset is generated for the purpose of the study, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note that it is part of the experimental setup described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I include the relevant details and context for each dataset extracted from the paper.
