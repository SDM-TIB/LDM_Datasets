To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparative Evaluation of Predominant Deep Learning Quantified Stock Trading Strategies" by Haohan Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of deep learning models for stock trading but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction references platforms like **JoinQuant** and **BigQuant**, which may imply the use of historical market data but does not specify datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** to look for any specific datasets used in the simulations. In the **experiments section**, the author mentions running trading strategies based on three models during simulated scenarios. However, it appears that the datasets are not named explicitly in this section either.

I will then check the **appendix** and **references** for any additional information regarding datasets. The appendix lists **47 factors** used by the models, which are derived from stock data, but it does not provide specific dataset names. The references include links to platforms like JoinQuant and BigQuant, which may provide access to datasets but do not serve as formal citations for datasets used in the study.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any named datasets or provide citations for them, I will conclude that the datasets used are likely proprietary or derived from the mentioned platforms. Therefore, I will note the following:

1. **JoinQuant**: A platform for constructing machine learning algorithms and simulating trading scenarios based on historical market data. However, no specific dataset citation is provided.
2. **BigQuant**: Another platform mentioned for similar purposes, but again, no specific dataset citation is provided.

In summary, while the paper discusses the use of historical market data and factors derived from stock data, it does not provide explicit dataset names or formal citations. I will document the platforms mentioned as sources of data but will note the absence of specific dataset citations in my final output.
