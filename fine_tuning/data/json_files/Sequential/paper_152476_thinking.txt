To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How did the discussion go: Discourse act classification in social media conversations" by Subhabrata Dutta, Tanmoy Chakraborty, and Dipankar Das, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on two datasets: one from Reddit and one from Facebook. This suggests that there are specific datasets that I need to locate.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors discuss the datasets used for training and testing their models. In **section 4.1**, they mention the **Coarse Discourse Dataset**, which is a Reddit dataset with over 9000 discussion threads and 100,000 comments, classified into various discourse act tags. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Additionally, they refer to a second dataset, which is an **extended version of the Facebook discussion dataset**. This dataset contains 20 threads of discussions from Facebook pages with a total of 1177 comments, annotated with discourse act labels. This dataset is also important for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Coarse Discourse Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, A.X., Culbertson, B., Paritosh, P. (2017). *Characterizing online discussion using coarse discourse sequences*. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Web and Social Media. AAAI Press, pp. 1–10.

- For the **Facebook discussion dataset**, the authors reference their own previous work:
  > Dutta, S., Das, D. (2017). *Dialogue modelling in multi-party social media conversation*. In International Conference on Text, Speech, and Dialogue, pp. 219–227. Springer.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
