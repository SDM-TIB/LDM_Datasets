To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prototypical Recurrent Unit" by Dingkun Long et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental study sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental study section**, as this is where the authors typically detail the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention several tasks, including the **Memorization Problem**, **Adding Problem**, **Character Prediction Problem**, and **MNIST Image Classification Problem**. Each of these tasks likely involves specific datasets.

1. **Memorization Problem**: The authors describe generating datasets for this problem based on parameters (I, N, δ). They mention creating 50,000 training examples and 1,000 testing examples for each configuration. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name, as the data is generated synthetically.

2. **Adding Problem**: Similar to the Memorization Problem, the datasets for the Adding Problem are generated based on the parameters (N, δ). They specify generating 2,000 training examples and 400 testing examples, but again, no specific dataset name is provided.

3. **Character Prediction Problem**: The authors use a dataset derived from Shakespeare's works, which consists of 1,115,393 character occurrences. This dataset is explicitly named and will require a full citation.

4. **MNIST Image Classification Problem**: The authors refer to the MNIST dataset, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification. This dataset is also explicitly named and will need a full citation.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the explicitly mentioned datasets:

- For the **Shakespeare dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karpathy, A. (2015). *The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks*. Retrieved from https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., & Burges, C. (1998). *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. Retrieved from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the datasets for the Memorization and Adding Problems are generated synthetically and do not have formal citations, I will note that they are not applicable for citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations where applicable. This will ensure that all relevant information is documented clearly and accurately for future reference or processing.
