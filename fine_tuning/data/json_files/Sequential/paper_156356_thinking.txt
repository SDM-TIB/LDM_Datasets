To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Successor Features with Distributed Hebbian Temporal Memory" by Evgenii Dzhivelikian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used for their experiments. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, the authors mention testing their model in two environments: **Gridworld** and **AnimalAI**. I will note these as they are likely to be the datasets or environments used for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the datasets are well-known, I may also look for their original papers or sources to ensure I have the correct citations.

For the **Gridworld environment**, I will note that it is a common benchmark in reinforcement learning, but I will still look for any specific citation provided in the paper. If none is provided, I will reference it as a standard benchmark.

For the **AnimalAI environment**, I will find the citation for the original paper that introduced this testbed. The citation is:
> Matthew Crosby, Benjamin Beyret, Murray Shanahan, José Hernández-Orallo, Lucy Cheke, and Marta Halina. *The Animal-AI Testbed and Competition*. In Proceedings of the NeurIPS 2019 Competition and Demonstration Track, volume 123 of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, pages 164–176, PMLR, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both the Gridworld and AnimalAI environments, even if one is a standard benchmark.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
