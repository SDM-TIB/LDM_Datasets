To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VoiceMoji: A Novel On-Device Pipeline for Seamless Emoji Insertion in Dictation" by Sumit Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions a novel pipeline for emoji insertion but does not specify datasets. However, the introduction discusses the need for emoji prediction in transcribed text, which may lead to dataset references later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsections that detail the processing pipeline. In the section titled **III. PROCESSING PIPELINE**, the authors state that there is no open dataset available for evaluating their complete pipeline. However, they mention using a custom dataset of over 10,000 samples collected from 10 individuals, annotated by experts. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their work.

I will also look for any specific datasets mentioned for training or benchmarking individual modules. In the **Text Processing: Emoji Boundary Detection** subsection, the authors specify that they used the **CNN/DM dataset** for training their emoji boundary detection model. This dataset is significant and needs to be documented.

Furthermore, in the **Text Understanding: Emoji Prediction** subsection, the authors mention using the **Twitter corpus** for training their semantic analysis model. This is another important dataset that should be included in the extraction.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **CNN/DM dataset**, the citation is:
   > Hermann, K. M., Kocisky, T., Grefenstette, E., Espeholt, L., Kay, W., Suleyman, M., & Blunsom, P. (2015). Teaching machines to read and comprehend. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* (pp. 1693-1701).

2. For the **Twitter corpus**, the citation is:
   > Pak, A., & Paroubek, P. (2010). Twitter as a corpus for sentiment analysis and opinion mining. In *LREC* (Vol. 10, pp. 1320-1326).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
