To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GROOT: Corrective Reward Optimization for Generative Sequential Labeling" by Kazuma Hashimoto and Karthik Raman, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that GROOT was evaluated on **four public benchmarks**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they list the datasets along with their characteristics in Table 2. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **ATIS Dataset**: A slot-filling task covering the travel domain, with 4,478 training examples, 500 validation examples, and 893 test examples.
2. **SNIPS Dataset**: Another slot-filling task, this time for virtual assistants, with 13,084 training examples, 700 validation examples, and 700 test examples.
3. **MIT-R Dataset**: A semantic parsing dataset from the dining domain, containing 6,845 training examples, 789 validation examples, and 1,516 test examples.
4. **MTOP Dataset**: A multilingual task-oriented semantic parsing benchmark, with 15,667 training examples, 2,235 validation examples, and 4,386 test examples.
5. **CoNLL03 Dataset**: A named-entity recognition dataset from the news domain, with 11,330 training examples, 2,012 validation examples, and 3,193 test examples.
6. **CoNLL00 Dataset**: A chunking dataset, also from the news domain, with 11,814 training examples, 3,466 validation examples, and 3,684 test examples.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
