To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Better Modeling Hierarchical Structure for Self-Attention with Ordered Neurons" by Jie Hao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experimental results on a benchmark machine translation task, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In **section 3.1 (Machine Translation)**, they explicitly state that they used the **WMT14 English⇒German dataset** for their machine translation experiments. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will then look for additional details about the dataset in the text. The authors mention that the WMT14 dataset consists of about 4.56 million sentence pairs, and they specify the development and test sets used. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WMT14 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Rico Sennrich, Barry Haddow, and Alexandra Birch. *Neural machine translation of rare words with subword units*. In Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 1715–1725, 2016.

Since the paper primarily discusses the WMT14 dataset for machine translation, I will compile this information into a structured format.

After gathering all necessary details, I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the dataset name, description, and the full citation, ready for further processing or review.
