To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BioCopy: A Plug-And-Play Span Copy Mechanism in Seq2Seq Models" by Yi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method, it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of existing copy mechanisms in seq2seq models but do not mention any specific datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section**, as this is where datasets are typically detailed.

In **section 3 (Experiment)**, the authors mention two specific datasets used for their experiments:

1. **New York Times (NYT) Corpus**: This dataset is used for the generative relation extraction task. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of training and testing examples.

2. **CAIL2020 Dataset**: This dataset is used for the auxiliary experiment on abstractive summarization. The authors mention that it contains 9,484 sample pairs of legal texts and summaries.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For the **New York Times (NYT) Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Zeng, X., Zhang, H., & Liu, K. (2018). Extracting relational facts by an end-to-end neural model with copy mechanism. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 506â€“514, Melbourne, Australia. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **CAIL2020 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > CAIL2020. (2020). Chinese AI Law Challenge 2020. Retrieved from https://github.com/china-ai-law-challenge/CAIL2020/tree/master/sfzy

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citations are complete and accurate.
