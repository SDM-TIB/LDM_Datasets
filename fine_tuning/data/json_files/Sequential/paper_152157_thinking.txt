To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Two Stream LSTM: A Deep Fusion Framework for Human Action Recognition" by Harshala Gammulle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on three widely used databases: **UCF11**, **UCF Sports**, and **jHMDB**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will extract the following information:

1. **UCF11 Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing 1600 videos across 11 action categories, with various challenges such as illumination conditions and camera motion.

2. **UCF Sports Dataset**: This dataset consists of 150 video sequences categorized into 10 action classes, with varying lengths of video sequences.

3. **jHMDB Dataset**: The authors mention that this dataset contains 923 videos belonging to 21 action classes, including both daily life activities and sports.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **UCF11 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Liu, J. Luo, and M. Shah. *Recognizing realistic actions from videos in the wild*. IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009.

- For the **UCF Sports Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. D. Rodriguez, J. Ahmed, and M. Shah. *Action mach: a spatio-temporal maximum average correlation height filter for action recognition*. In Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2008.

- For the **jHMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Jhuang, J. Gall, S. Zufﬁ, C. Schmid, and M. J. Black. *Towards understanding action recognition*. In IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3192–3199, Sydney, Australia, Dec. 2013.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
