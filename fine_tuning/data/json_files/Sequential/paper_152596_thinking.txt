To extract datasets from the research paper titled "XJTLUIndoorLoc: A New Fingerprinting Database for Indoor Localization and Trajectory Estimation Based on Wi-Fi RSS and Geomagnetic Field" by Zhenghang Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the XJTLUIndoorLoc database, which is a key dataset for this research. The introduction further emphasizes the need for such a database due to the lack of existing datasets that combine Wi-Fi and geomagnetic data.

Next, I will focus on the **section II (XJTLUIndoorLoc: A New Fingerprint Database)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They mention that the database consists of both Wi-Fi received signal strength (RSS) and geomagnetic field intensity data collected from a multi-floor building at Xiâ€™an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. The dataset includes 969 reference points, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope.

In the **data set description subsection**, the authors provide specifics about the data collection process, including the number of access points detected and the types of measurements taken. This section confirms that the XJTLUIndoorLoc database is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the XJTLUIndoorLoc dataset. However, since this dataset is newly introduced in this paper, it may not have a separate citation. Instead, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Zhenghang Zhong, Zhe Tang, Xiangxing Li, Tiancheng Yuan, Yang Yang, Meng Wei, Yuanyuan Zhang, Renzhi Sheng, Naomi Grant, Chongfeng Ling, Xintao Huan, Kyeong Soo Kim, and Sanghyuk Lee. *XJTLUIndoorLoc: A New Fingerprinting Database for Indoor Localization and Trajectory Estimation Based on Wi-Fi RSS and Geomagnetic Field*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN), 2023.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry for XJTLUIndoorLoc, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset for any future reference or analysis.
