To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Sequence-to-Sequence Baseline for the Voice Conversion Challenge 2020: Cascading ASR and TTS" by Wen-Chin Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions the voice conversion challenge (VCC) 2020, which suggests that there are datasets associated with this challenge. The introduction elaborates on the challenge and hints at the use of a common dataset for voice conversion tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **data sections** of the paper, specifically **Sections 3 (ASR Implementation)** and **4 (TTS Implementation)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for training their models. In Section 3.1, they mention using the **Librispeech dataset**, which contains 960 hours of English speech data from over 2000 speakers. This is a significant dataset for automatic speech recognition (ASR).

In Section 4.1, the authors detail the datasets used for the TTS model in task 2. They mention the **M-AILABS dataset**, which has a large amount of data from a few speakers, and the **CSS10 dataset**, which is a collection of single speaker speech datasets for 10 languages. They also reference the **CSMSC dataset**, which is a Chinese standard Mandarin speech corpus.

I will also check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Librispeech dataset**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective references.
