To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid deep learning methods for phenotype prediction from clinical notes" by Sahar Khalafi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **MIMIC III database** for their experiments, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. They state that they utilized **discharge reports from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC III)** database, which contains clinical notes, including nursing, medical, radiological, and discharge reports.

In this section, they also reference the work of Gehrmann et al. (2018), who annotated the discharge reports. This is crucial because it provides context for the dataset's use and its relevance to the study.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the MIMIC III dataset in the **References section**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> A. E. Johnson et al., "MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database," Scientific data, vol. 3, no. 1, pp. 1-9, 2016.

Additionally, I will note that the authors refer to the annotations provided by Gehrmann et al. (2018) for the discharge reports. The citation for this work is:
> S. Gehrmann et al., "Comparing deep learning and concept extraction based methods for patient phenotyping from clinical narratives," PloS one, vol. 13, no. 2, p. e0192360, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MIMIC III Database**: This dataset is used for identifying patient phenotypes from clinical notes, specifically discharge reports.
   - Citation: A. E. Johnson et al., "MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database," Scientific data, vol. 3, no. 1, pp. 1-9, 2016.

2. **Annotated Discharge Reports**: These reports were annotated by Gehrmann et al. and are used for training and testing the models.
   - Citation: S. Gehrmann et al., "Comparing deep learning and concept extraction based methods for patient phenotyping from clinical narratives," PloS one, vol. 13, no. 2, p. e0192360, 2018.

With this information, I will prepare to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
