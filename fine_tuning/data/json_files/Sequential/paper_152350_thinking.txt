To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FLICA: A Framework for Leader Identification in Coordinated Activity" by Chainarong Amornbunchornvej et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their framework on both simulated and real-world data, specifically mentioning **GPS tracks of a baboon troop**, **video-tracking of fish schools**, and **stock market closing price data of the NASDAQ index**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will look into the **methods** section, particularly the **evaluation datasets** subsection, which is likely to provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention three real datasets:

1. **Baboon Trajectories**: This dataset consists of high-resolution GPS data tracking 26 individuals of a troop of olive baboons (Papio anubis) over a 9-day period, with a total of 419,095 time steps. The citation for this dataset is:
   > M. C. Crofoot, R. W. Kays, and M. Wikelski. *Data from: Shared decision-making drives collective movement in wild baboons*. 2015.

2. **Fish Schools Trajectories**: This dataset includes trajectories of 70 fish, with 10 trained individuals leading the school to feeding sites over 24 leadership events. The citation for this dataset is:
   > A. Strandburg-Peshkin, D. R. Farine, I. D. Couzin, and M. C. Crofoot. *Shared decision-making drives collective movement in wild baboons*. Science, 348(6241):1358â€“1361, 2015.

3. **Stock Closing-Price Time Series**: The authors collected daily closing price data for stocks listed in NASDAQ from January 2000 to January 2016, focusing on discovering coordinated events and the leaders involved. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Yahoo! Finance. *Daily closing price data for stocks listed in NASDAQ*. Available at: http://finance.yahoo.com/.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or reporting.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
