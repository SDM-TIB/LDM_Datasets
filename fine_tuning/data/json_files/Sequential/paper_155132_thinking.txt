To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series, Econometric, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning Models" by Ananda Chatterjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets used in the study.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors used stock price data from **Infosys, ICICI, and SUN PHARMA** for the period from January 2004 to December 2019. This indicates that these three companies' stock data is a primary dataset for the research.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** section, specifically under the **Problem Statement** and **Methodology** subsections, where the authors describe the data collection process. They state that the stock price data for the three companies was obtained from **Yahoo Finance**. This is crucial information as it provides the source of the datasets.

In the **experiments** section, the authors detail how they used the datasets for training and testing various models. They specify that the training data consists of stock prices from January 2004 to December 2018, while the testing data is from January 2019 to December 2019. This temporal division is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **Infosys Stock Price Data**: This dataset includes daily stock prices (open, high, low, close, and volume) for Infosys from January 2004 to December 2019.
2. **ICICI Stock Price Data**: This dataset includes daily stock prices for ICICI for the same period.
3. **SUN PHARMA Stock Price Data**: This dataset includes daily stock prices for SUN PHARMA for the same period.

Next, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets from the references section. However, since the datasets are derived from Yahoo Finance and not from a specific research paper, I will cite Yahoo Finance as the source for each dataset.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- For **Infosys Stock Price Data**:
  > Yahoo Finance. *Infosys Limited (INFY) Stock Historical Prices & Data*. [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INFY/history?p=INFY).

- For **ICICI Stock Price Data**:
  > Yahoo Finance. *ICICI Bank Limited (ICICIBANK.NS) Stock Historical Prices & Data*. [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ICICIBANK.NS/history?p=ICICIBANK.NS).

- For **SUN PHARMA Stock Price Data**:
  > Yahoo Finance. *Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (SUNPHARMA.NS) Stock Historical Prices & Data*. [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SUNPHARMA.NS/history?p=SUNPHARMA.NS).

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and can be used for further analysis or documentation.
