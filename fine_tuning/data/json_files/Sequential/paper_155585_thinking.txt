To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Electricity Price Forecasting Model based on Gated Recurrent Units" by Naﬁse Rezaei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it discusses the methodology, it does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Evaluation and Results)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the data relates to the price of electricity consumed in Iran over three years, specifically noting that it includes hourly electricity prices. They provide details about the dataset size, indicating that it contains 35,040 samples, with 28,032 samples used for training and 7,008 for testing.

The authors also provide a link to where the dataset can be accessed, which is crucial for citation purposes. The dataset is publicly available at: https://www.igmc.ir/Electronic-Services/Power-Market-Deputy/Reports.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is publicly available and does not appear to be attributed to a specific paper or author in the references, I will note that the dataset is from the Iranian electricity market.

Based on this information, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Iran Electricity Market Price Dataset**: This dataset contains hourly electricity prices collected over three years, totaling 35,040 samples. It is publicly available for download.

The citation for this dataset will be:
> Iranian Electricity Market Price Dataset. Available at: https://www.igmc.ir/Electronic-Services/Power-Market-Deputy/Reports.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
