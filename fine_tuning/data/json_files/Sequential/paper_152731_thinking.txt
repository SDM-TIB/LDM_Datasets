To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Team EP at TAC 2018: Automating data extraction in systematic reviews of environmental agents" by Artur Nowak and Pawe≈Ç Kunstman, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction discusses the systematic review process and the need for data extraction, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets and pre-processing)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention that the organizers prepared two datasets:

1. **Training Set**: This consists of 100 annotated "Material and methods" sections extracted from PubMed Central articles. It includes identifiers and contains nearly 7,000 sentences and 152,000 words.

2. **Test Set**: This set also contains 100 texts, but the annotations were not released until the submission deadline. Additionally, there are 344 further texts that were not used in evaluation to discourage manual annotation.

The authors provide detailed statistics about the training set, including the number of sentences, words, and entity classes, which confirms the datasets' relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are derived from PubMed Central articles. Instead, I will note that the datasets are based on the PubMed Central database.

Since the datasets are not named after specific publications but rather are collections of annotated texts from a well-known database, I will summarize the information as follows:

- **Training Set**: Annotated "Material and methods" sections from PubMed Central articles.
- **Test Set**: Additional annotated texts from PubMed Central, with specific identifiers.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring to include the relevant details about the datasets and their source.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for context.
2. Focus on the datasets section for specific details.
3. Note the source of the datasets as PubMed Central.
4. Prepare to summarize the findings without specific citations since the datasets are not attributed to individual papers.

This process ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research while adhering to the importance of full citations where applicable.
