To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Score Figure Skating Sport Videos" by Chengming Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors present a large-scale figure skating sports video dataset called the **FisV dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is being introduced.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the datasets. The authors mention that their model is validated on the **FisV dataset** and the **MIT-skate dataset**. This suggests that both datasets are important for their research.

I will then look into **section III (Figure Skating Video (Fis-V) Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the **FisV dataset**. They mention that it includes 500 figure skating videos, each annotated with scores from nine different referees. This section will provide essential details such as the number of videos, the average length of the videos, and the scoring system used.

In the same section, the authors also reference the **MIT-skate dataset**. I will gather information about this dataset as well, including its size and the context in which it is used.

After gathering the necessary details, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. For the **FisV dataset**, the citation is:
   > Chengming Xu, Yanwei Fu, Zitian Chen, Bing Zhang, Yu-Gang Jiang, Xiangyang Xue. *Learning to Score Figure Skating Sport Videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

2. For the **MIT-skate dataset**, the citation is:
   > H. Pirsiavash, C. Vondrick, and Torralba. *Assessing the Quality of Actions*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Now that I have the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details, ensuring that the full citations are included for proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant information is accurately captured and formatted.
