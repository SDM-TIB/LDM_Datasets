To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Emotion Analysis on EEG Signal Using Machine Learning and Neural Network" by S. M. Masrur Ahmed and Eshaan Tanzim Sabur, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **DEAP Dataset** for their experiments, which is a strong lead.

Next, I will look into the **Methodology** section, specifically under **Data Materials**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the DEAP dataset. They mention that it includes physiological signals from 32 participants and is used for emotion classification based on valence, arousal, dominance, and liking. This confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in the study.

I will also check the **Results** and **Conclusion** sections to see if the authors reference the DEAP dataset again, which they do, reinforcing its significance in their research.

Now, I need to gather the full citation for the DEAP dataset from the **References section**. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **DEAP Dataset**: 
  > Koelstra, S., Muehl, C., Soleymani, M., Lee, J.-S., Yazdani, A., Ebrahimi, T., Pun, T., Nijholt, A., Patras, I. "DEAP: A Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals." *IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing*, vol. 3, no. 1, pp. 18-31, 2012.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extraction process:

1. **Identify the dataset**: The DEAP dataset is mentioned in the abstract and methodology sections.
2. **Gather details**: The methodology section provides specifics about the dataset, including the number of participants and types of physiological signals collected.
3. **Confirm usage**: The dataset is referenced in the results and conclusion, confirming its role in the research.
4. **Retrieve citation**: The full citation for the DEAP dataset is found in the references section.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
