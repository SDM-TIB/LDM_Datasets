To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Syllable-Based Neural Named Entity Recognition for Myanmar Language" by Hsu Myat Mo and Khin Mar Soe, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that a "very first manually annotated NER corpus for Myanmar language is also constructed and proposed." This suggests that there is a dataset created specifically for this research.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **data preparation** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In the **data preparation** section, the authors mention that they developed a manually annotated Myanmar NER corpus, which is a significant dataset for their experiments. They also state that they collected sentences from online news websites and used sentences from the ALT-Parallel-Corpus, which is part of the Asian Language Treebank (ALT) project.

I will note the specifics of the datasets mentioned:
1. **Manually Annotated Myanmar NER Corpus**: This dataset consists of over 60,000 sentences, with a breakdown of 58,043 for training, 1,200 for development, and 1,200 for testing. The authors defined six types of named entity tags for manual annotation.

2. **ALT-Parallel-Corpus**: This corpus is mentioned as a source of sentences that include transliterated names, which are important for the NER task.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the newly created NER corpus, as it is the authors' own contribution. However, I will need to cite the ALT-Parallel-Corpus appropriately.

The citation for the ALT-Parallel-Corpus is:
> Asian Language Treebank (ALT) project. Available at: http://www.nict.go.jp/en/asean_ivo/index.html.

Since the manually annotated NER corpus is a new contribution, I will note it as:
> Hsu Myat Mo and Khin Mar Soe. *Manually Annotated Myanmar NER Corpus*. Unpublished dataset, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
