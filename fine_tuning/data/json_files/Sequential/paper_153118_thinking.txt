To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Debugging Deep Neural Networks by Generating Speech Utterances" by Bilal Soomro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained a classifier using the **Speech Commands corpus**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their work.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used. They mention the **Speech Commands corpus v0.02**, detailing that it contains 105,829 utterances recorded from 2,618 speakers, with 35 commands including twenty trigger words. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's characteristics.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Speech Commands corpus. The citation provided in the paper is:
> P. Warden, “Speech Commands: A Dataset for Limited-Vocabulary Speech Recognition,” ArXiv e-prints, Apr. 2018. Available: https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03209.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Now, I will summarize the findings for the dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will allow for a clear and comprehensive extraction of the dataset information from the paper.
