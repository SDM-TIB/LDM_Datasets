To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High Quality Streaming Speech Synthesis with Low, Sentence-Length-Independent Latency" by Nikolaos Ellinas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions an end-to-end text-to-speech system, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of training and evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the shift towards neural models for text-to-speech synthesis, but I need to look for specific datasets mentioned. I will pay attention to any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors state that they trained their model on the **LJ Speech dataset**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized. I will look for any additional datasets mentioned in this section or throughout the paper.

Upon reviewing the **experiments and results**, I find that the authors specifically mention using the **LJ Speech dataset** for training their model. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including any specifics about the data format or characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **LJ Speech dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> K. Ito, “The LJ speech dataset,” https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/, 2017.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **LJ Speech dataset**, ensuring that it is ready for any downstream processing or review.
