To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Influence of Global Constraints on Similarity Measures for Time-Series Databases" by Vladimir Kurbalija et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction often contains specific references to datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of time series in various applications and mention that they will analyze the effects of global constraints on similarity measures. However, they do not specify any datasets here.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (The Impact of the Sakoe-Chiba Band on Time-Series Distance Measures)**, where the authors describe their experiments. They mention that they conducted experiments on **46 datasets from the UCR Time Series Repository**. This indicates that the UCR repository is a significant source of datasets for their analysis.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide a detailed list of the datasets used in their experiments, including their sizes, lengths, and the number of classes. I will extract the names of these datasets along with their respective properties.

The datasets mentioned in the paper include:

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The UCR Time Series Repository is cited as follows:

- Keogh, E., Ratanamahatana, C.A., 2011. The UCR Time Series Classification/Clustering Homepage: www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries along with their citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
