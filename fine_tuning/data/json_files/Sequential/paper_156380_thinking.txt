To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StairNet: Visual Recognition of Stairs for Human-Robot Locomotion" by Andrew Garrett Kurbis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a large-scale dataset with over 515,000 manually labeled images, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (StairNet Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe the dataset as containing over 515,000 RGB images that are manually annotated with hierarchical class labels for environments encountered during locomotion. This section will likely contain the specifics I need for the dataset entry.

In this section, I will note the following details:
- The dataset is open-source and available at a specified URL, which is crucial for accessibility.
- The dataset includes class labels to reduce overlap and maximize theoretical performance for model development.
- The images were captured using a chest-mounted wearable camera, which adds context to the dataset's creation.

I will also look for any references to other datasets that may have been used in conjunction with the StairNet dataset. The authors mention that they developed the StairNet dataset using images from **ExoNet**, which is another dataset relevant to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for both the StairNet dataset and the ExoNet dataset. The citations will be essential for proper attribution.

For the **StairNet dataset**, the citation is:
> Kurbis, A. G., Kuzmenko, D., Ivanyuk-Skulskiy, B., Mihailidis, A., & Laschowski, B. (2023). StairNet: Visual Recognition of Stairs for Human-Robot Locomotion. *bioRxiv*. 

For the **ExoNet dataset**, the citation is:
> Laschowski, B., McNally, W., Wong, A., & McPhee, J. (2020). ExoNet Database: Wearable Camera Images of Human Locomotion Environments. *Frontiers in Robotics and AI*.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper.
