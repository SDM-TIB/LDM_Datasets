To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Refining Raw Sentence Representations for Textual Entailment Recognition via Attention" by Jorge A. Balazs et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the model and its performance but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the task of Natural Language Inference (NLI) and mention the **RepEval 2017 shared task**. This indicates that the datasets used for their experiments may be related to this shared task.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely. Here, the authors state that they used a sampled portion of the **SNLI corpus** (Bowman et al., 2015) and added it to the **MultiNLI corpus**. This is a crucial finding as it identifies two specific datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **SNLI corpus**, the citation is:
   > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 632–642, 2015. http://aclweb.org/anthology/D15-1075.

2. For the **MultiNLI corpus**, the citation is:
   > William Yang, Mark Garder, and Samuel R. Bowman. *Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 632–642, 2017. http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05426.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:
- **SNLI corpus**: Used for training and evaluation in the NLI task.
- **MultiNLI corpus**: Supplemented with a portion of the SNLI corpus for experiments.

I will ensure that the full citations are included in any final output to maintain academic integrity and provide proper credit to the original authors.
