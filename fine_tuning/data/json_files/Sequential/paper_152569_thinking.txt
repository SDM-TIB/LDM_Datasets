To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Power Market Price Forecasting via Deep Learning" by Yongli Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the study utilizes **hourly prices data from the New England and PJM day-ahead markets**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **Data Wrangling section (Section II)**, where the authors describe the datasets in more detail. In subsection A, they specify that the power market price data is sourced from the **New England ISO (ISO-NE)** and **PJM** for the year 2009. This confirms the datasets I noted from the abstract.

I will then look for any additional details about these datasets, such as their characteristics, size, or specific features, which may be mentioned in the paper. The authors describe the data as **hourly based** and indicate that it is used for day-ahead power market forecasting.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites two sources for the datasets:

1. For the **New England ISO (ISO-NE)** dataset, the citation is:
   > Markets Data and Information. [Online]. Available: https://www.iso-ne.com/markets-operations/markets

2. For the **PJM dataset**, the citation is:
   > PJM Regulation Zone Preliminary Billing Data. [Online]. Available: http://www.pjm.com/markets-and-operations/billing-settlements-and-credit/preliminary-billing-reports/pjm-reg-data.aspx

With this information, I have identified the datasets used in the research and their respective citations. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
