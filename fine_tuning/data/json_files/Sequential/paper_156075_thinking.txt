To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Energy-based Language Models with Different Architectures and Training Methods for Speech Recognition" by Hong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on **two datasets, AISHELL-1 and WenetSpeech**. This indicates that these datasets are significant to the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors provide more details about the datasets. In section 4.1, they explicitly state that they used **AISHELL-1**, which is described as a 178-hour Mandarin speech dataset, and **WenetSpeech**, which is a 1000+ hours multi-domain transcribed Mandarin speech dataset. This confirms that both datasets are indeed used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **AISHELL-1**, the citation is:
  > H. Bu, J. Du, X. Na, B. Wu, and H. Zheng. *AISHELL-1: An open-source Mandarin speech corpus and a speech recognition baseline*. In 2017 20th Conference of the Oriental Chapter of the International Coordinating Committee on Speech Databases and Speech I/O Systems and Assessment (O-COCOSDA), 2017, pp. 1–5.

- For **WenetSpeech**, the citation is:
  > B. Zhang, H. Lv, P. Guo, Q. Shao, C. Yang, L. Xie, X. Xu, H. Bu, X. Chen, C. Zeng, D. Wu, and Z. Peng. *WenetSpeech: A 10000+ hours multi-domain Mandarin corpus for speech recognition*. In International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2022, pp. 6182–6186.

With this information, I have successfully identified and cited the datasets used in the paper. I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
