To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TRABSA: Interpretable Sentiment Analysis of Tweets using Attention-based BiLSTM and Twitter-RoBERTa" by Md Abrar Jahin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors have augmented existing datasets with tweets from various sources, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** section. In this paper, the authors describe their data collection process in detail, indicating that they used several datasets categorized into Benchmark, Extended, and External datasets.

1. **Benchmark Dataset**: The authors mention a benchmark dataset of COVID-19 tweets collected from the UK, which consists of 77,332 tweets gathered during the third nationwide COVID-19 shutdown. This dataset serves as a standard for evaluating their proposed model.

2. **Extended Global COVID-19 Dataset**: This dataset includes 411,885 tweets scraped from 32 English-speaking countries. It aims to capture sentiment variations across different regions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

3. **Extended USA COVID-19 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 7,500 tweets collected from various U.S.-based sources, providing localized insights into sentiment dynamics within the United States.

4. **External Datasets**: The authors utilized four external datasets sourced from Kaggle:
   - **Twitter Dataset**: A diverse collection of tweets covering various topics.
   - **Reddit Dataset**: User-generated content from Reddit, allowing for sentiment analysis in a different context.
   - **Apple Dataset**: Textual data related to Apple Inc., providing insights into sentiment in the tech industry.
   - **US Airline Dataset**: Discussions related to U.S. airlines, enabling sentiment analysis within the aviation sector.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **data availability** section to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper provides links to the repositories where the datasets can be accessed:

- For the **Global Twitter COVID-19 Dataset** and **USA Twitter COVID-19 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jahin, M. A. Extended Covid Twitter Datasets, DOI: 10.17632/2ynwykrfgf.1 (2023). Publisher: Mendeley Data.

- For the **Twitter and Reddit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Twitter and Reddit Dataset. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cosmos98/twitter-and-reddit-sentimental-analysis-dataset.

- For the **Apple Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Apple Dataset. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/seriousran/appletwittersentimenttexts.

- For the **US Airline Dataset**, the citation is:
  > US Airline Dataset. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately represent the datasets used in the research paper.
