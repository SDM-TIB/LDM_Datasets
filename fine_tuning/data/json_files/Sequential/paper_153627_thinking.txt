To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DALC: Distributed Automatic LSTM Customization for Fine-Grained Traffic Speed Prediction" by Ming-Chang Lee and Jia-Chun Lin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for fine-grained traffic prediction and mentions the use of traffic data collected by detectors, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors describe their validation process. They mention using traffic data collected by the California Department of Transportation Performance Measurement System, which is a consolidated database of traffic data collected at 5-minute intervals by detectors on state highways throughout California. This indicates that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the California Department of Transportation Performance Measurement System as follows:

- California Department of Transportation Performance Measurement System. *Welcome to PeMS*. Available at: http://pems.dot.ca.gov/ [accessed Feb/03/2020].

Additionally, the authors refer to specific detectors and their traffic-speed data collected over certain periods, but they do not provide a separate dataset citation for these individual detectors. Instead, they rely on the overarching dataset provided by the California Department of Transportation.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as it is critical for proper attribution.

The key dataset extracted is:
1. **California Department of Transportation Performance Measurement System**: A consolidated database of traffic data collected at 5-minute intervals by detectors placed on state highways throughout California.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing.
