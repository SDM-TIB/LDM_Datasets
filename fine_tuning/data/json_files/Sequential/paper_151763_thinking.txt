To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Practical Computational Power of Finite Precision RNNs for Language Recognition" by Gail Weiss et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but it may not mention specific datasets. The introduction, however, often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in the experiments or related work.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that describe the experimental setup or methodology, as these sections typically detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. 

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any mention of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors describe the datasets in detail, I will note down the key points such as the number of samples, types of data (e.g., sequences, images), and any specific attributes that are relevant to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to search for it in other literature or online databases to ensure accuracy.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, complete with proper citations for each.
