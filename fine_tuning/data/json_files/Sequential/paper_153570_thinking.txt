To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TextNAS: A Neural Architecture Search Space tailored for Text Representation" by Yujing Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models on various public datasets for text classification and natural language inference tasks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they mention running experiments on the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)** dataset, which is a well-known dataset for sentiment classification. They also refer to another version of this dataset, **SST-Binary**, which has only two classes.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results section** or in the tables that summarize the experiments. In Table 2, the authors list several datasets used for text classification, including:

1. **AG Dataset**: A dataset for news categorization.
2. **Sogou Dataset**: A dataset for Chinese text classification.
3. **DBP Dataset**: A dataset for Wikipedia article categorization.
4. **Yelp Dataset**: A dataset for sentiment analysis of Yelp reviews.
5. **Yahoo Dataset**: A dataset for question classification.
6. **Amazon Dataset (AMZ)**: A dataset for product reviews.
7. **Amazon Binary Dataset (AMZ-B)**: A binary version of the Amazon dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or analysis.
