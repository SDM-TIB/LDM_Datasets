To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Onto Word Segmentation of the Complete Tang Poems" by Chao-Lin Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The introduction discusses the challenges of Chinese word segmentation (CWS) and mentions the **Complete Tang Poems (CTP)** as the primary dataset used for the study. This indicates that I should focus on this dataset.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methodology and results sections**. The paper states that the authors have segmented **2433 regulated octave poems** from the CTP, which is a significant detail. I will note that these poems are segmented by domain experts, which adds credibility to the dataset.

In the **results section**, the paper discusses the performance metrics achieved using the segmented poems, confirming that these **2433 segmented poems** are indeed the dataset used for evaluation. The paper does not mention any other datasets, so I will focus solely on the CTP.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Complete Tang Poems. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Dingqiu Peng (1645-1719) et al. eds. *Quan Tang Shi* 全唐詩 (The Complete Tang Poems). Beijing: Zhonghua Book Company, 2003. (in Chinese)

Since this is the only dataset mentioned, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Complete Tang Poems.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Complete Tang Poems, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
