To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Verge of Solving Rocket League using Deep Reinforcement Learning and Sim-to-sim Transfer" by Marco Pleines et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the training of agents in a simulation environment and their transfer to the original game, which suggests that there may be datasets related to the training scenarios.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that describe the training environments for the agents. The paper mentions two specific environments: the **goalie environment** and the **striker environment**. I will look for any references to datasets or data used to train the agents in these environments.

In the **goalie environment**, the authors state that the agent faces 1,000 different samples of shots during training. This indicates that there is a dataset of shot samples used for training the goalie agent. However, the paper does not provide a formal name for this dataset.

In the **striker environment**, the authors mention that the ball's speed and origin are sampled uniformly from 1,000 samples during the agent's training. Again, this suggests the existence of a dataset for training the striker agent, but it is not explicitly named.

Since the paper does not provide formal names for these datasets, I will need to create descriptive entries based on the information provided. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works provide datasets that could be relevant. The references include works related to the RoboLeague and RLBot, which are mentioned as sources for the simulation environment. However, they do not provide specific datasets.

Given that the paper does not explicitly name datasets, I will summarize the datasets based on the training environments described:

1. **Goalie Training Dataset**: Comprises 1,000 different shot samples that vary in speed, direction, and origin, used to train the goalie agent.

2. **Striker Training Dataset**: Comprises 1,000 samples for the ball's speed and origin, used to train the striker agent.

Since these datasets are not formally cited in the paper, I will note that they are derived from the training environments described in the methodology.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details and context for each dataset, even though formal citations are not available. This will provide a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research.
