To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Machine Learning on Data from Professional Cyclists" by Agrin Hilmkil et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors perform a pilot experiment on machine learning to model the physical response of elite cyclists, which suggests that they are using specific datasets related to cycling performance.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods** section, as this is where the authors typically describe the data they collected and used for their experiments. In this section, the authors state that they collected data from both male and female professional cyclists, with each file corresponding to a training session or race. They mention that the dataset includes time-series data recorded from bike computers and associated sensors, which is crucial information.

I will also pay attention to any **figures or tables** that might summarize the datasets or provide additional details about the data collection process. The paper describes the dataset as consisting of 7541 sessions from 15 male professional cyclists, which is a key detail that I need to note.

Now, I will check the **results** and **discussion** sections to see if the authors refer to any specific datasets or provide insights into how the data was used in their analysis. They discuss the training and validation sets, which are derived from the overall dataset, but I need to ensure that I capture the original dataset's details.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned in the paper. The authors reference several studies and sources that may provide context or additional information about the datasets they used.

Based on my reading, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Cycling Performance Dataset**: This dataset consists of time-series data collected from bike computers and sensors during training sessions of professional cyclists. It includes various metrics such as heart rate, power output, speed, and altitude, with a total of 7541 sessions from 15 male cyclists.

For the citation, I will refer to the paper itself since it is the primary source of the dataset information:
> Agrin Hilmkil, Oscar Ivarsson, Moa Johansson, Dan Kuylenstierna, Teun van Erp. *Towards Machine Learning on Data from Professional Cyclists*. Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key details and citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
