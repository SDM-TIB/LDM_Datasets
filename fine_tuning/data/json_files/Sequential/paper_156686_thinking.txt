To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Maritime Trajectory Forecasting via H3 Index and Causal Language Modelling (CLM)" by Nicolas Drapier et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on ship trajectory prediction, but I need to look for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of predicting ship trajectories and mention the use of GNSS and AIS data. However, they do not specify any datasets yet.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe their approach in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset used to train the model was captured by the authors themselves, covering a period of one week in August 2023. They provide specific geographical coordinates for the working area, which indicates the dataset's scope but does not provide a formal name or citation.

In **section 4.3**, the authors state that the dataset consists of 1,731,686 unique trajectories within a set of around 32 million H3 cells, totaling approximately 4 billion tokens. They also mention that the testing phase was conducted using another dataset captured during three days in February 2024, representing around 15,000 cleaned trajectories. However, they do not provide formal names or citations for these datasets.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets used, I will note that the primary dataset is self-captured and lacks a formal reference. The authors do not cite any external datasets, which means I cannot provide full citations for them.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:

1. **Self-Captured Dataset**: This dataset covers a period of one week in August 2023, with geographical coordinates (−43.33, −88.59; 80.25, 168.34). It consists of 1,731,686 unique trajectories and around 4 billion tokens. No formal citation is provided.

2. **Testing Dataset**: Captured during three days in February 2024, this dataset represents approximately 15,000 cleaned trajectories. Again, no formal citation is provided.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets or provide formal citations, I will note that the datasets are self-captured and do not have associated citations.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entries, noting the lack of formal citations, and prepare them for structured output.
