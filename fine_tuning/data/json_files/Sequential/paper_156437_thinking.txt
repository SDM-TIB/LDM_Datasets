To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Where exactly does contextualization in a PLM happen?" by Soniya Vijayakumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The introduction provides context about the study, but I need to focus on sections that explicitly mention datasets.

In the **Methodology section**, the authors state that they use the **Contextualised Polysemy Word Sense v2 Dataset** (Haber and Poesio, 2020). This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in their experiments. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and how it is used in the study.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Contextualised Polysemy Word Sense v2 Dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Janosch Haber and Massimo Poesio. *Word sense distance in human similarity judgements and contextualised word embeddings*. In Proceedings of the Probability and Meaning Conference (PaM 2020), pages 128â€“145, Gothenburg. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered.

Now, I will summarize the findings for the dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format, ready for any further processing or review.
