To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Action Unit Detection with Region Adaptation, Multi-labeling Learning and Optimal Temporal Fusing" by Wei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed approach is evaluated on two popular AU detection datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **DISFA Dataset**: This dataset involves 26 human subjects who watched videos to capture spontaneous facial expressions. The authors note that the AUs are labeled with intensities from 0 to 5, and they mention that over 100,000 AU-labeled images can be obtained from the videos.

2. **BP4D Dataset**: This dataset includes 23 female and 18 male young adults, with both 2D and 3D videos captured while subjects displayed various facial expressions. The authors state that there are around 140,000 images with AU labels available for use.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **DISFA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Valstar and M. Pantic. *Fully automatic facial action unit detection and temporal analysis*. In 2006 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop (CVPRW’06), pages 149–149, IEEE, 2006.

- For the **BP4D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Z. Zhu, W. Li, F. Abtahi, and M. Pantic. *BP4D: A high-resolution database of spontaneous facial expressions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1–8, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
