To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive re-calibration of channel-wise features for Adversarial Audio Classification" by Vardhan Dongre et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **Fake or Real (FoR) dataset** for training and testing their models, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **Introduction** section, where the authors discuss the prevalence of speech synthesis and spoofer attacks. They mention the need for datasets to evaluate their models, which reinforces the importance of identifying the datasets used.

In the **Experimental Setup** section, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. They mention two primary datasets:

1. **Fake or Real (FoR) Dataset**: This dataset is specifically designed for studies in speech synthesis and synthetic speech detection. It contains speech clips generated by various state-of-the-art speech synthesis algorithms, ensuring a balanced distribution of samples between genders and classes (fake and natural). The FoR-norm version of this dataset contains 69,400 speech clips.

2. **ASVSpoof2019 Logical Access (LA) Dataset**: This dataset is used to evaluate the effectiveness and generalization power of the fake speech detection models. It is referenced as a benchmark for assessing the models trained on the FoR dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Fake or Real (FoR) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Reimao, R., & Tzerpos, V. (2019). For: A dataset for synthetic speech detection. In 2019 International Conference on Speech Technology and Human-Computer Dialogue (SpeD) (pp. 1â€“10). IEEE.

- For the **ASVSpoof2019 Logical Access (LA) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, X., Yamagishi, J., Todisco, M., Delgado, H., Nautsch, A., Evans, N., Sahidullah, M., Vestman, V., Kinnunen, T., Lee, K. A., et al. (2020). ASVSpoof 2019: A large-scale public database of synthesized, converted and replayed speech. Computer Speech & Language, 64, 101114.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
