To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hopeful Men@LT-EDI-EACL2021: Hope Speech Detection Using Indic Transliteration and Transformers" by Ishan Sanjeev Upadhyay et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **HopeEDI dataset** for their experiments, which is a strong lead.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors explicitly mention the **HopeEDI dataset** (Chakravarthi, 2020) as the dataset used for hope speech detection. This confirms the dataset's relevance to their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the dataset, including its composition and the distribution of classes (hope speech, not hope speech, and other languages). They mention that the dataset consists of YouTube comments in English, Tamil, and Malayalam, which further clarifies the dataset's scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **HopeEDI dataset**. The citation provided is:
> Bharathi Raja Chakravarthi. 2020. HopeEDI: A multilingual hope speech detection dataset for equality, diversity, and inclusion. In Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Computational Modeling of People’s Opinions, Personality, and Emotion’s in Social Media, pages 41–53, Barcelona, Spain (Online). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **HopeEDI Dataset**: This dataset consists of YouTube comments annotated as "hope speech," "not hope speech," and "not in intended language" in three languages: English, Tamil, and Malayalam. The dataset includes a total of 28,451 comments in English, 10,705 comments in Malayalam, and 20,198 comments in Tamil.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
