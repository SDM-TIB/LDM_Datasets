To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Stock Price Prediction Using Temporal Graph Model with Value Chain Data" by Chang Liu and Sandra Paterlini, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on two datasets, specifically the **Eurostoxx 600** and **S&P 500**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look closely at **section III (Data and Methodological Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. They mention that the Eurostoxx 600 comprises the largest 600 companies from 17 European countries, while the S&P 500 includes the largest 500 publicly traded firms in the United States. This section confirms the datasets used for their experiments.

In this section, the authors also describe how they acquired the supplier-customer relationships from Thomson Reuters Refinitiv, which is essential for understanding the context of the datasets. They provide additional details about the historical closing prices and the preprocessing steps taken to ensure data quality.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Eurostoxx 600**, the citation is:
  > "Eurostoxx 600 Index." *Stoxx Ltd.* [Online]. Available: https://www.stoxx.com/index-details?symbol=SXXP

- For the **S&P 500**, the citation is:
  > "S&P 500 Index." *S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC.* [Online]. Available: https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

In summary, I have identified the datasets used in the paper, confirmed their relevance through the methodology section, and retrieved the necessary citations from the references. I will now prepare the dataset entries for further processing.
