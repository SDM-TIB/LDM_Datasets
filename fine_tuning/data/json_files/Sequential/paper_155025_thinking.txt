To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised 3D Pose Estimation for Hierarchical Dance Video Recognition" by Xiaodan Hu and Narendra Ahuja, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract states that the authors have assembled a new dataset called the **University of Illinois Dance (UID) Dataset**, which is a strong indication that this is a key dataset for their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the UID dataset. The authors mention that the dataset contains 1143 video clips of 9 genres covering 30 hours, annotated with movement and genre labels. This provides a good overview of the dataset's scope and purpose.

I will then look into the **experiments** section, specifically section 3.1, where the authors provide a detailed description of the UID dataset. They list the total number of clips, the minimum and maximum clip lengths, and the total duration of the dataset. This section confirms the dataset's characteristics and its relevance to the experiments conducted in the paper.

After gathering information about the UID dataset, I will check the **references** section for the full citation. The UID dataset is mentioned in the supplementary material, and the authors provide a link to access it. However, since it is a newly created dataset, it may not have a formal citation in the references. Instead, I will note the authors and the title of the dataset as follows:

- **University of Illinois Dance (UID) Dataset**: 
  > Xiaodan Hu and Narendra Ahuja. *University of Illinois Dance (UID) Dataset*. Available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-SdWYxIorbhQzi9Bp_HpJf25_ieMjoh5?usp=sharing.

Next, I will also check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the **AIST Dance Video Dataset** in section 3.1, which is used for comparison in their experiments. I will look for the full citation for this dataset in the references section.

- **AIST Dance Video Dataset**: 
  > Shuhei Tsuchida, Satoru Fukayama, Masahiro Hamasaki, and Masataka Goto. *AIST Dance Video Database: Multi-genre, Multi-dancer, and Multi-camera Database for Dance Information Processing*. In Proceedings of the 20th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference, ISMIR 2019, pages 501–510, Delft, Netherlands, November 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **University of Illinois Dance (UID) Dataset**:
   - Description: Contains 1143 video clips of 9 genres covering 30 hours, annotated with movement and genre labels.
   - Citation: Xiaodan Hu and Narendra Ahuja. *University of Illinois Dance (UID) Dataset*. Available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-SdWYxIorbhQzi9Bp_HpJf25_ieMjoh5?usp=sharing.

2. **AIST Dance Video Dataset**:
   - Description: A dataset containing multi-view dance sequences from 10 dance genres with hundreds of choreographies.
   - Citation: Shuhei Tsuchida, Satoru Fukayama, Masahiro Hamasaki, and Masataka Goto. *AIST Dance Video Database: Multi-genre, Multi-dancer, and Multi-camera Database for Dance Information Processing*. In Proceedings of the 20th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference, ISMIR 2019, pages 501–510, Delft, Netherlands, November 2019.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
