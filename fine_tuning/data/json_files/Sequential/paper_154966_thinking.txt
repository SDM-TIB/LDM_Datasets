To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Offensive Language Identification for Tamil Code-Mixed YouTube Comments and Posts" by Charangan Vasantharajan and Uthayasanker Thayasivam, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study focuses on offensive language detection in Tamil code-mixed text from YouTube comments, suggesting that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the dataset was taken from a competition on Offensive Language Identification in Dravidian Languages. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including its purpose, the types of comments it contains, and the classification categories.

The dataset is described as follows:
- **Tamil-English Dataset**: This dataset consists of comments and posts collected from YouTube, categorized into six classes: Not-Offensive, Offensive-Targeted-Insult-Individual, Offensive-Targeted-Insult-Group, Offensive-Targeted-Insult-Other, Offensive-Untargeted, and Not-Tamil. The dataset is noted for its imbalance, with a significant number of instances in the Not-Offensive class compared to the others.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset in the **References section**. The authors refer to the dataset as part of a shared task on offensive language identification, which is cited as follows:
> Charangan Vasantharajan, Uthayasanker Thayasivam. *Findings of the shared task on offensive language identification in Tamil, Malayalam, and Kannada*. In Proceedings of the First Workshop on Speech and Language Technologies for Dravidian Languages, pp. 133â€“145. Association for Computational Linguistics, Kyiv (2021). URL: https://aclanthology.org/2021.dravidianlangtech-1.17

With this information, I can now compile the dataset details and citation into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify the focus on datasets.
2. Examining the datasets section for explicit mentions and descriptions.
3. Noting the classification categories and dataset characteristics.
4. Retrieving the full citation from the references for proper attribution.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the relevant dataset information and provide proper citations for future reference.
