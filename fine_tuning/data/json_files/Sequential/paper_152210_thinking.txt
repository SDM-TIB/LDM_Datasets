To extract datasets from the research paper titled "p-DLA: A Predictive System Model for Onshore Oil and Gas Pipeline Dataset Classification and Monitoring - Part 1" by E.N. Osegi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a predictive monitoring system and hints at the use of pipeline datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed involved.

In the **introduction**, the author mentions the need for predictive classification of pipeline data and references datasets developed by other researchers. This indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 4), where the author explicitly states that two pipeline datasets were used for simulations. The datasets are referenced as being developed by other researchers, specifically noted as [13] and [14]. 

I will then look for the specific details of these datasets in the text. The paper mentions:

1. **Dataset from [13]**: This dataset is described as a small feature set with less than 20 exemplars.
2. **Dataset from [14]**: This dataset is larger, containing about 190 exemplars.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the dataset referenced as [13], the citation is:
  > Tan, D., Zhang, H., & Liu, L. (2016). *Signal Classification for Pipeline Security Threat Event Based on Optimized Support Vector Machine*. Key Engineering Materials, 693.

- For the dataset referenced as [14], the citation is:
  > Lam, C. (2015). *Statistical Analyses of Historical Pipeline Incident Data with Application to the Risk Assessment of Onshore Natural Gas Transmission Pipelines* (Masterâ€™s dissertation, The University of Western Ontario).

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Dataset from [13]**: A small feature set for pipeline security threat event classification, containing less than 20 exemplars.
2. **Dataset from [14]**: A larger dataset for statistical analyses of historical pipeline incidents, containing about 190 exemplars.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or processing.
