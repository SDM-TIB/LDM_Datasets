To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Two-Step Framework for Arbitrage-Free Prediction of the Implied Volatility Surface" by Wenyong Zhang, Lingfei Li, and Gongqiu Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the data used for training the models. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** (Section 2.4) where the authors describe the dataset used in their study. Here, they mention that the dataset contains implied volatility surfaces for S&P 500 index options from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2020, obtained from OptionMetrics through the Wharton Research Data Services. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the dataset, including the time frame and source.

I will also check the **experiments section** (Section 4) to see if the authors refer to any additional datasets or provide further details about the dataset used for training and testing their models. This section may contain insights into how the dataset was utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. In this case, the dataset is derived from OptionMetrics, and I will ensure to provide the correct citation format for this source.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> OptionMetrics. *Implied Volatility Surface Data for S&P 500 Index Options*. Available from Wharton Research Data Services.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset, including its name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the dataset is accurately represented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of the dataset information from the research paper.
