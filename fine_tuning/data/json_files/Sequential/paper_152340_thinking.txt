To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTM based Conversation Models" by Yi Luan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on the **Ubuntu Dialog Corpus**, which indicates that this is a dataset used in their research. I will note this down as a potential dataset.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, particularly **section 4.1 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they specify that the **Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus** consists of one million two-person conversations extracted from Ubuntu chat logs, with specific splits for training, testing, and development. This confirms that the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus is indeed the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus. The relevant citation is:

- For **Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus**:
  > Ryan Lowe, Nissan Pow, Iulian Serban, and Joelle Pineau. *The Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus: A Large Dataset for Research in Unstructured Multi-Turn Dialogue Systems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.08909, 2015.

Since the paper primarily focuses on this dataset, I will ensure to include it in my dataset extraction.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research.

In summary, the steps I followed include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Examining the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Consulting the references for full citations of the identified datasets.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus, ensuring it is ready for any further processing or review.
