To extract datasets from the research paper titled "JamBot: Music Theory Aware Chord Based Generation of Polyphonic Music with LSTMs" by Gino Brunner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset for training their model, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used for training their models. They specifically mention using a subset of the **Lakh MIDI Dataset**. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I will need to gather more details about it.

In this section, the authors describe the Lakh MIDI Dataset as containing approximately one hundred thousand songs in MIDI format. They explain the advantages of using MIDI files, such as reduced storage space and ease of manipulation for training neural networks. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's context and significance.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the Lakh MIDI Dataset in the **References section**. The citation is as follows:
> Raffel, C. (2016). Learning-Based Methods for Comparing Sequences, with Applications to Audio-to-MIDI Alignment and Matching. Columbia University.

Additionally, I will note that the authors also mention preprocessing steps and the creation of a "shifted dataset" derived from the original Lakh MIDI Dataset. However, since the shifted dataset is not a standalone dataset but rather a modified version of the Lakh MIDI Dataset, I will not create a separate citation for it.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the Lakh MIDI Dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format, ready for review or further processing.
