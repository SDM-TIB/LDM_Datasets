To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stock Price Correlation Coefficient Prediction with ARIMA-LSTM Hybrid Model" by Hyeong Kyu Choi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of an ARIMA-LSTM hybrid model for predicting stock price correlation coefficients, which suggests that datasets related to stock prices are involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Research Methodology)**, particularly the subsections that detail the data used for the ARIMA and LSTM models. In **subsection 4.1.1 (the Data)**, the author mentions utilizing the adjusted close price of S&P500 firms, specifically stating that data from 2008-01-01 to 2017-12-31 was downloaded. This indicates that the dataset consists of historical stock price data for S&P500 companies.

The author also notes that they randomly selected 150 stocks from this dataset, which is crucial for understanding the scope of the data used in the experiments. The paper states that the correlation coefficients of each pair of assets were computed using a rolling time window, resulting in 55,875 sets of time series data.

In the **appendices**, I will look for any additional details or lists of the specific stocks used. The **Appendix A** provides a list of the 150 randomly selected S&P500 stocks, which is essential for documenting the dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The primary dataset is the historical stock price data for S&P500 firms, which can be cited as follows:

- **S&P500 Stock Price Dataset**: The dataset consists of adjusted close prices for S&P500 companies from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2017. The data was sourced from the Quandl API.

Next, I will ensure that I have the correct citation format for the source of the S&P500 data. The citation for the Quandl API is:

> Quandl. *Quandl API for financial and economic data*. Available at: https://www.quandl.com (accessed May 23, 2018).

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the data used in the research.
