To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prodigy: An Expeditiously Adaptive Parameter-Free Learner" by Konstantin Mishchenko and Aaron Defazio, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the experiments. The abstract mentions testing Prodigy on **12 common logistic-regression benchmark datasets** and various deep learning tasks, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** (Section 6). Here, the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. I will carefully note each dataset mentioned, including any relevant details such as the number of samples or specific characteristics that may be important for understanding the dataset's context.

In the **experiments section**, the authors list the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **IWSLT14**: A dataset used for machine translation tasks, specifically for the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation.

3. **Criteo dataset**: A large-scale dataset used for click-through rate prediction in online advertising.

4. **Knee MRI dataset**: A dataset used for medical imaging tasks, specifically for knee MRI analysis.

5. **BookWiki**: A dataset used for training language models, derived from Wikipedia and books.

6. **Various logistic-regression benchmark datasets**: The paper mentions testing on 12 common datasets, but does not specify their names. I will note that these datasets are not explicitly listed in the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the experiments are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **IWSLT14**:
  > The IWSLT 2014 Evaluation Campaign. *International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation*, 2014.

- For **Criteo dataset**:
  > Maxim Naumov et al. *Deep learning recommendation model for personalization and recommendation systems*. CoRR, 2019.

- For **Knee MRI dataset**:
  > Jure Zbontar et al. *fastMRI: An open dataset and benchmarks for accelerated MRI*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.08839, 2018.

- For **BookWiki**:
  > Alec Radford et al. *Improving language understanding by generative pre-training*. Technical report, OpenAI, 2019.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
