To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reduced-Gate Convolutional LSTM Using Predictive Coding for Spatiotemporal Prediction" by Nelly Elsayed et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their model on the **moving MNIST** and **KITTI datasets**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions in the **experiments section**. In the section discussing the **Moving MNIST dataset**, the authors describe it as consisting of 10,000 video sequences of two randomly selected moving digits from the MNIST dataset, with each sequence being 20 frames long and having a frame size of 64x64 grayscale pixels. This provides a clear understanding of the dataset's structure and purpose.

For the **KITTI dataset**, the authors mention that it is a collection of real-life traffic videos captured by a roof-mounted camera, divided into three categories: city, residential, and road. This dataset is used for evaluating the model's performance on RGB video sequences.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Moving MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Srivastava, N., Mansimov, E., & Salakhudinov, R. (2015). Unsupervised Learning of Video Representations using LSTMs. International Conference on Machine Learning, 2015, 843–852.

2. **KITTI Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Geiger, A., Lenz, P., Stiller, C., & Urtasun, R. (2013). Vision Meets Robotics: The KITTI Dataset. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 32(11), 1231–1237.

With these citations, I can now summarize the datasets:

- **Moving MNIST Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 10,000 video sequences of two randomly selected moving digits from the MNIST dataset, each sequence being 20 frames long with a frame size of 64x64 grayscale pixels.
- **KITTI Dataset**: A collection of real-life traffic videos captured by a roof-mounted camera, divided into categories such as city, residential, and road.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
