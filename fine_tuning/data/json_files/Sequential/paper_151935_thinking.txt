To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Semantic Concepts and Order for Image and Sentence Matching" by Yan Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on two public benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Protocols)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Flickr30k**: This dataset consists of 31,783 images collected from the Flickr website, with each image accompanied by 5 human-annotated sentences. The authors specify the training, validation, and testing splits used in their experiments.

2. **MSCOCO**: This dataset contains 82,783 training images and 40,504 validation images, with each image associated with 5 sentences. The authors also detail the splits they used for training and testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Flickr30k**, the citation is:
  > Young, P., Lai, A., Hodosh, M., & Hockenmaier, J. (2014). From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions. *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, 2, 67-78.

- For **MSCOCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollar, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context. In *European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)* (pp. 740-755).

Now that I have the dataset names and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
