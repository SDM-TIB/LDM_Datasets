To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SkateboardAI: The Coolest Video Action Recognition for Skateboarding" by Hanxiao Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors have curated a dataset called "SkateboardAI," which is a strong lead. The introduction further emphasizes that this dataset is the first of its kind for skateboarding action recognition, confirming its significance.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (SkateboardAI Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the dataset's origin, the number of videos collected, and the specific categories of skateboarding tricks included. The dataset consists of 750 videos categorized into 15 different tricks, with 50 videos per category.

The dataset details include:
- **Dataset Name**: SkateboardAI
- **Description**: A dataset containing 750 videos of skateboarding tricks, categorized into 15 classes (Ollie, Kickflip, Shuvit, etc.).
- **Video Count**: 750 videos (50 videos per trick class).
- **Trick Classes**: Ollie, Kickflip, Shuvit, Manual, Hardflip, 50-50 grind, 5-0 grind, Backside 180, Backside Air, Boardslide, Boneless 180, Smith grind, Benihana, Impossible, Treflip.

After gathering this information, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the dataset. However, since "SkateboardAI" is an original dataset created by the authors, it may not have a formal citation like established datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is introduced in this paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and any relevant details. The citation for the dataset will be the paper itself, as it is the primary source of this dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for "SkateboardAI" with the necessary details, ensuring that the citation is clear and complete.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Hanxiao Chen. *SkateboardAI: The Coolest Video Action Recognition for Skateboarding*. Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information about the dataset from the paper.
