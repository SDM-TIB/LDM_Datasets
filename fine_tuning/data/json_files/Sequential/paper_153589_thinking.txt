To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpreting LSTM prediction on Solar Flare Eruption with Time-series Clustering" by Hu Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the study's objectives and the datasets they might have used. The abstract mentions the use of **Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) parameters**, which indicates that this dataset is central to their analysis.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets, particularly the **data preparation** section. Here, the authors describe the SHARP parameters calculated from vector magnetogram data, which are crucial for their LSTM model training. They mention that the SHARP parameters are derived from the **Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)** data, which is a significant dataset for solar physics research.

In the **data preparation section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the SHARP parameters used, including the specific parameters like **TOTUSJH, TOTPOT, USFLUX**, and others. They also mention the time frame of the data collected, which spans from **mid-2010 through 2018**. This information is essential for documenting the dataset.

I will also check the **appendix** for any additional datasets or supplementary information. The appendix includes a summary of active regions with sudden transitions of LSTM prediction scores, which may not be a dataset in the traditional sense but is relevant for understanding the context of the analysis.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) parameters**: The dataset is derived from the HMI instrument on the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The relevant citation is:
   > Bobra, M. G., & Couvidat, S. (2015). *Astrophysical Journal*, 798, 135. doi:10.1088/0004-637X/798/2/135.

2. **Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) data**: The citation for the HMI data is:
   > Schou, J., Scherrer, P. H., Bush, R. I., et al. (2012). *Solar Physics*, 275, 229. doi:10.1007/s11207-011-9842-2.

3. **NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) flare list**: This dataset is referenced for identifying flare events, but a specific citation is not provided in the paper. However, it is widely recognized in solar physics research.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its citation for future reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
