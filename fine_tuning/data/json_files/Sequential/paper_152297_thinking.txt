To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simple and Accurate Dependency Parsing Using Bidirectional LSTM Feature Representations" by Eliyahu Kiperwasser and Yoav Goldberg, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 6 (Experiments and Results)**. In this section, the authors discuss their evaluation methodology and may explicitly mention the datasets used for training and testing their models.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **Stanford Dependency (SD) dataset** derived from the **Penn Treebank** for English and the **Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB5)** for Chinese. These datasets are crucial for their experiments, and I will note their details.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I find are:

- For the **Stanford Dependency (SD)** dataset:
  > de Marneffe, M.-C., & Manning, C. D. (2008). Stanford dependencies manual. Technical report, Stanford University.

- For the **Penn Treebank**:
  > Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. Computational Linguistics, 19(2), 313-330.

- For the **Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB5)**:
  > Zhang, Y., & Clark, S. (2008). A tale of two parsers: Investigating and combining graph-based and transition-based dependency parsing. In Proceedings of the 2008 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 562-571). Association for Computational Linguistics.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets used in the paper:

1. **Stanford Dependency (SD) dataset**: Derived from the Penn Treebank, used for English dependency parsing.
2. **Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB5)**: Used for Chinese dependency parsing.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
