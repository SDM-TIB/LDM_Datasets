To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Linear Transformers" by Subhojeet Pramanik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any sections explicitly labeled as "Datasets" or similar. If such a section exists, I will extract the names and descriptions of the datasets mentioned.

In this paper, the authors evaluate their methods in several reinforcement learning environments. I will identify the specific environments mentioned, as these often correspond to datasets or benchmarks used in the experiments. For instance, the paper discusses environments like **T-Maze**, **CartPole**, **Mystery Path**, and **Memory Maze**. Each of these environments serves as a dataset for testing the proposed methods.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

For example, if the paper references the T-Maze environment, I would look for the original source of that environment, which is likely to be cited in the references. The citation might look something like this:
- Bakker, R. (2001). *Reinforcement learning with long short-term memory*. In Neural Information Processing Systems.

Similarly, I will do this for any other datasets or environments mentioned in the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information for output, ensuring it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
