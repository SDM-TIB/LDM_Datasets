To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Performance of Sequential Deep Learning Models in Detecting Phishing Websites Using Contextual Features of URLs" by Faranak Abri et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experimental setup, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the **experimental setup** section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors mention that the dataset for training and testing was collected from a public GitHub repository. They specify that the dataset contains a total of **73,575 URLs**, which includes **36,400 legitimate URLs** and **37,175 phishing URLs**. This is a clear indication of the dataset's composition and size.

Next, I will look for the exact name of the dataset and its source. The authors refer to the dataset as being from a public GitHub repository, specifically citing it as "ebubekirbbr/pdd: Personal Data Detector." This is crucial information for the dataset entry.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant reference is:

- For the dataset from GitHub, the citation is:
  > EBUBEKIRBBR. ebubekirbbr/pdd: Personal Data Detector. 2021. Github repository Accessed on March 29, 2023.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Personal Data Detector
   - **Description**: A dataset containing a total of 73,575 URLs, including 36,400 legitimate URLs and 37,175 phishing URLs, used for training and testing deep learning models for phishing detection.
   - **Citation**: EBUBEKIRBBR. ebubekirbbr/pdd: Personal Data Detector. 2021. Github repository Accessed on March 29, 2023.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and citation as required.
