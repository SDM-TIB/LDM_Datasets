To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast on-line signature recognition based on VQ with time modeling" by Juan Manuel Pascual-Gaspar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors mention using the **MCYT database** and the **SVC database**, which indicates that these are the primary datasets utilized in their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for additional context about these datasets. The authors state that the MCYT database consists of 330 users and includes skilled forgeries, which provides a clearer understanding of its scope and purpose.

I will then look into the **experimental setup** section, specifically **section 3.1**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of both datasets:

1. **MCYT Database**: This database was acquired using a WACOM graphics tablet and includes 330 users, each providing 25 genuine signatures and 25 skilled forgeries. The data includes various features such as position, pressure, azimuth, and altitude angles.

2. **SVC Database**: This database is similar to the MCYT database and includes 40 users with 20 genuine signatures and 20 skilled forgeries. The signatures were designed by contributors, which adds a layer of complexity to the dataset.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for the datasets:

- For the **MCYT Database**, the citation is:
  > Ortega-Garcia, J., Gonzalez-Rodriguez, J., Simon-Zorita, D., Cruz-Llanas, S. (2003). MCYT Baseline Corpus: A Multimodal Biometric Database. *IEE Proceedings - Vision, Image and Signal Processing*, 150, 395-401. DOI: 10.1049/ip-vis:20031078.

- For the **SVC Database**, the citation is:
  > Yeung, D., Chang, H., Xiong, Y., George, S., Kashi, R., Matsumoto, T., Rigoll, G. (2004). SVC2004: First international signature verification competition. *Lecture Notes on Computer Science*, 3072, 16-22.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
