To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NEAR: Named Entity and Attribute Recognition of clinical concepts" by Namrata Nath et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on the **i2b2 2010/VA** and **i2b2 2012** shared task datasets, which suggests that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **results** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets in the **Dataset** section, where they provide detailed information about both datasets:

1. **i2b2 2010/VA Dataset**: This dataset includes named entities and assertion annotations, specifically for clinical concepts such as problems, treatments, and tests. It consists of 426 records (170 for training and 256 for testing) and provides various assertion types related to the entities.

2. **i2b2 2012 Dataset**: This dataset also includes named entities, polarity, and modality annotations. It contains 310 records (190 for training and 120 for testing) and provides polarity types (positive or negative) and modality types (whether an event actually happens, is proposed, etc.).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **i2b2 2010/VA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ö. Uzuner, B. R. South, S. Shen, and S. L. DuVall. "2010 i2b2/VA challenge on concepts, assertions, and relations in clinical text." *J. Am. Med. Informatics Assoc.*, vol. 18, no. 5, pp. 552–556, Sep. 2011.

- For the **i2b2 2012 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > W. Sun, A. Rumshisky, and O. Uzuner. "Evaluating temporal relations in clinical text: 2012 i2b2 Challenge." *Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association*, vol. 20, no. 5, pp. 806–813, 2013.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
