To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Automatic Forecasting: Evaluation of Time-Series Forecasting Models for Chickenpox Cases Estimation in Hungary" by Wadie Skaf et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize a dataset collected in Hungary for their time-series forecasting models, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of county-level time series data depicting the weekly number of chickenpox cases reported by general practitioners in Hungary from 2005 to 2015. This section provides key characteristics of the dataset, including the geographical breakdown into 20 counties.

The dataset is attributed to Rozemberczki et al. (2021), which is crucial for citation purposes. I will ensure to note this reference for the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the chickenpox cases dataset:
  > Rozemberczki, B., Scherer, P., Kiss, O., Sarkar, R., & Ferenci, T. (2021). *Chickenpox cases in Hungary: a benchmark dataset for spatiotemporal signal processing with graph neural networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.08100.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Chickenpox Cases Dataset**: This dataset includes weekly reported cases of chickenpox in Hungary from 2005 to 2015, categorized by 20 counties.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
