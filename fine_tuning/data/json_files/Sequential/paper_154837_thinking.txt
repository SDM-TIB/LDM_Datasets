To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Multiple Stock Trading Patterns with Temporal Routing Adaptor and Optimal Transport" by Hengxu Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on real-world stock ranking tasks, which suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find specific details.

Next, I will look into **section 6.1.2 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset they constructed based on the China stock market data. They mention that they collected publicly available data for **CSI800 stocks** from baostock.com and extracted 16 features relevant to stock prediction.

The authors provide a detailed description of the dataset, including the features used, the time period for training, validation, and testing, and the methodology for avoiding data leakage. This section is crucial as it gives me the necessary information to document the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is based on publicly available data from baostock.com, it may not have a formal citation like a typical research dataset. Instead, I will note the source as follows:

- **CSI800 Dataset**: The dataset is derived from publicly available data for CSI800 stocks from baostock.com, which includes various financial features relevant for stock prediction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation or source for each dataset as required.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Review the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the dataset section for detailed descriptions.
3. Note the source of the dataset from the references or the text.
4. Document the dataset information clearly, including the source.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
