To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extremely Small BERT Models from Mixed-Vocabulary Training" by Sanqiang Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed models on language understanding benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Evaluation Tasks and Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they detail the tasks and the corresponding datasets:

1. **Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC)**: This dataset is used for a 2-way sentence pair classification task with 3.7K training instances.

2. **Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI)**: This dataset is utilized for a 3-way sentence pair classification task with 393K training instances.

3. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)**: This dataset is employed for a 2-way sentence classification task with 67K training instances.

4. **SNIPS Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 14K virtual assistant queries, used for spoken language understanding tasks, including intent detection and slot filling.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
