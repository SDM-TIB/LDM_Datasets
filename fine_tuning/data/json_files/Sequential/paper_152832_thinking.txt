To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Language Models as Psycholinguistic Subjects: Representations of Syntactic State" by Richard Futrell et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of various models trained on large datasets, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental methodology section** where the authors describe the models tested. Here, they mention two LSTM models trained on large datasets and an RNNG trained on a smaller, parsed dataset. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

In **Table 1**, the authors summarize the models and their training data. The first LSTM model, referred to as "JRNN," is trained on the **One Billion Word Benchmark**, which is a significant dataset for language modeling. The second LSTM model, "GRNN," is trained on **English Wikipedia**, which is another well-known dataset. The RNNG is trained on the **Penn Treebank**, a widely used dataset in natural language processing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **One Billion Word Benchmark**:
   - Citation:
     > Ciprian Chelba, Tomas Mikolov, Mike Schuster, Qi Ge, Thorsten Brants, Philipp Koehn, and Tony Robinson. *One billion word benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.3005, 2013.

2. **English Wikipedia**:
   - Citation:
     > The English Wikipedia dataset is not typically cited in a formal paper, but it is commonly referenced as a large corpus for language modeling. For specific citations, one might refer to the Wikipedia page or datasets derived from it.

3. **Penn Treebank**:
   - Citation:
     > Mitchell P. Marcus, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, and Beatrice Santorini. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313â€“330, 1993.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
