To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Higher Order Minkowski Loss for Improved Prediction Ability of Acoustic Model in ASR" by Vishwanath Pratap Singh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets and experiments**. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on the **LibriSpeech dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Data Description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the **LibriSpeech dataset**. They describe it as consisting of approximately 960 hours of read audiobooks, divided into subsets: "train-clean" (460 hours) and "train-others" (500 hours). Additionally, they mention the dev and test sets, which include "dev-clean," "dev-other," "test-clean," and "test-other," each with specific durations.

In **section 7 (Experimental Analysis and Results)**, the authors confirm that all experiments were conducted using the **LibriSpeech dataset**, further validating its importance in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **LibriSpeech dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- For **LibriSpeech dataset**:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), Brisbane, QLD, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the **LibriSpeech dataset** using the required format, ensuring that the citation is included.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured.
