To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-reference Tacotron by Intercross Training for Style Disentangling, Transfer and Control in Speech Synthesis" by Yanyao Bian et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific datasets in the main body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of controlling speech styles in text-to-speech models, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are likely to be detailed.

In **section 3 (Experiments)**, the authors mention that they trained their models on a **30 hours corpus recorded by 300 different non-professional Chinese speakers**, which includes various styles. They also provide a **Table 1** that lists partial details of the multi-style data corpus, including the number of recordings per speaker and style. This table is crucial for identifying the dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will extract the relevant information from **Table 1**. The table indicates that the dataset consists of recordings from 27 speakers across 5 different prosody styles, with specific counts for male and female speakers. However, the table does not provide a formal citation for this dataset.

To find the citation, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works refer to the dataset used. The authors mention that the data was recorded by the **Baidu Speech Department**, which suggests that the dataset may not have a formal publication but is an internal dataset used by Baidu.

Since the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset, I will note that the dataset is an internal corpus from Baidu, and I will summarize the details as follows:

1. **Baidu Speech Corpus**: A dataset consisting of 110 hours of recordings from 300 different non-professional Chinese speakers, including 178 females and 122 males, each recording about 500 utterances.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring to include the details and the context of the dataset as described in the paper. 

After this, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
