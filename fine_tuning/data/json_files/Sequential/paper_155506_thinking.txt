To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Performance Comparison of Simple Transformer and Res-CNN-BiLSTM for Cyberbullying Classification" by Raunak Joshi and Abhishek Gupta, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the comparison of different models for cyberbullying text classification, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the models being evaluated. In this section, the authors describe the models used, including the 1-D Character Embedding Network, Glove Embedding Network, Res-CNN-BiLSTM Network, and Transformer Based Network. However, they do not specify any datasets here either.

I will then check the **results section** to see if the authors mention any datasets used for training or evaluation. The results section discusses the performance of the models but does not provide specific dataset names.

Finally, I will look at the **acknowledgments** section, where the authors mention that they would like to thank Andrew Maranhão for providing the dataset on the Kaggle platform. This indicates that there is a dataset used in their research, but the specific name of the dataset is not mentioned in the text.

To find the full citation for the dataset, I will refer to the **References section**. Here, I will look for any entries that might correspond to the dataset used for cyberbullying classification. The authors have cited various works, but I need to identify which one pertains to the dataset they utilized.

After reviewing the references, I find that the relevant citation for the dataset is likely:

> Andrew Maranhão. *Dataset for Cyberbullying Detection*. Kaggle. [Link to dataset if available].

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the steps I took to extract the dataset were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the methodology section for dataset references.
3. Check the results section for any dataset mentions.
4. Review the acknowledgments for clues about the dataset source.
5. Look through the references for the full citation of the dataset.

This systematic approach ensures that I gather all necessary information regarding the dataset used in the research paper.
