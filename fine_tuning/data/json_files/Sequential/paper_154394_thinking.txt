To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Audio Anomalies Recognition Using Temporal Convolutional Attention Networks" by Qiang Huang and Thomas Hain, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **TIMIT dataset** for their experiments, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data and Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. They mention that they selected **3436 recordings** from the original TIMIT training set and **600 recordings** from the original TIMIT test set. This section also describes how the audio recordings were processed and the types of distortions applied, confirming the use of the TIMIT dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the TIMIT dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- **TIMIT Dataset**: 
  > J. Garofolo, Lori Lamel, W. Fisher, Jonathan Fiscus, D. Pallett, N. Dahlgren, and V. Zue. *Timit Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus*. Linguistic Data Consortium, November 1992.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the TIMIT dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included, as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work or analysis.
