To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recovery command generation towards automatic recovery in ICT systems by Seq2Seq learning" by Hiroki Ikeuchi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted using a **synthetic dataset** and a **realistic OpenStack dataset**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about these datasets. The introduction reiterates the use of both the synthetic dataset and the OpenStack dataset, confirming their importance in the experiments.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, specifically **Section III**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, the authors describe the **synthetic dataset** as being created to imitate realistic logs and recovery commands, and they mention that it consists of various types of failures grouped into categories. They also provide a detailed explanation of how the dataset was constructed, which is essential for understanding its context and application.

The **realistic OpenStack dataset** is also discussed in Section III, where the authors explain that they constructed an OpenStack system for validation and collected logs from various failures. They provide a list of 13 specific failures that were considered during the experiments, which adds depth to the dataset description.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are not traditional datasets with standalone citations, I will note that the synthetic dataset is generated by the authors and does not have a formal citation. The OpenStack dataset, on the other hand, is based on the OpenStack system, which is a well-known open-source project.

For the **OpenStack dataset**, I will cite the OpenStack project as follows:
> OpenStack. *OpenStack: The open source cloud operating system*. Available at: https://www.openstack.org/.

For the **synthetic dataset**, I will note that it is a dataset created by the authors for the purpose of their experiments and does not have a formal citation.

In summary, I will compile the dataset entries as follows:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: Created by the authors for experiments, no formal citation.
2. **OpenStack Dataset**: Based on the OpenStack system.
   > OpenStack. *OpenStack: The open source cloud operating system*. Available at: https://www.openstack.org/.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
