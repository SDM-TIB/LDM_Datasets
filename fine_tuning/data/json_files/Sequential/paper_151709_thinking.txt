To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Grow and Prune Compact, Fast, and Accurate LSTMs" by Xiaoliang Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have GP-trained H-LSTMs for **image captioning** and **speech recognition** applications, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be included.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. Here, the authors discuss the applications of LSTMs in various domains, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

Moving on to the **experimental results** section, particularly **section 4.1 (NeuralTalk for Image Captioning)**, I find that the authors report results on the **MSCOCO dataset**. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of images and the splits used for training, validation, and testing.

In **section 4.2 (DeepSpeech2 for Speech Recognition)**, the authors mention using the **AN4 dataset** for evaluating their speech recognition architecture. They provide information about the number of training and testing utterances, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MSCOCO dataset**, the citation is:
   > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision, 2014, pp. 740–755.

2. For the **AN4 dataset**, the citation is:
   > A. Acero. *Acoustical and environmental robustness in automatic speech recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, 1990.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **MSCOCO Dataset**: Used for image captioning, containing 123,287 images with five reference sentences per image.
- **AN4 Dataset**: Used for speech recognition, containing 948 training utterances and 130 testing utterances.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation.
