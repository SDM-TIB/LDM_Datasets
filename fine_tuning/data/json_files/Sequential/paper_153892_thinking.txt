To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Evaluation of Recent Neural Sequence Tagging Models in Turkish Named Entity Recognition" by Gizem Arasa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on a common dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is used for their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention the dataset they utilized: 

1. **The dataset from T端r et al. (2003)**: This dataset is described as a collection of articles from the national newspaper Milliyet, covering a specific time period. It contains Turkish sentences tagged with the BIO2 scheme in CoNNL format, along with morphological analyses of all sentence tokens.

To confirm the dataset's details, I will look for any additional references or descriptions in the **experiments** and **results** sections. The authors mention that they split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, which further validates its use in their study.

Now, I will locate the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The citation for the dataset is:

- For the dataset from T端r et al. (2003):
  > T端r, G., Hakkani-T端r, D., Oflazer, K. (2003). *A statistical information extraction system for Turkish*. Natural Language Engineering, 9(2), 181-210.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the required structure. This will include the dataset name, description, and the full citation, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented.
