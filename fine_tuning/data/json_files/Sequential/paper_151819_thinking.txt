To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Traffic Prediction Based on Random Connectivity in Deep Learning with Long Short-Term Memory" by Yuxiu Hua et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the application of a new model for traffic prediction, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section III), particularly the subsection titled **Traffic Data Description and Processing**. Here, the authors mention that they evaluate their model using real traffic data from the **GÉANT backbone networks**. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, and I need to gather more details about it.

The authors specify that the traffic data consists of **7289 traffic data points** collected over **76 workdays** from **January 1, 2005, to April 30, 2005**, with measurements taken at **15-minute intervals**. This is crucial information that I need to document.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the GÉANT dataset. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but it references the GÉANT project website, which can serve as a source for the dataset. The citation for the GÉANT project is:

> GÉANT. "GÉANT Project GN4." Available: https://www.geant.org/Projects/GEANT

Since the dataset is derived from the GÉANT backbone networks, I will note that the dataset is based on the GÉANT project data.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **GÉANT Traffic Data**: Contains 7289 traffic data points collected over 76 workdays from January 1, 2005, to April 30, 2005, with measurements taken at 15-minute intervals.

The citation for the dataset is:
> GÉANT. "GÉANT Project GN4." Available: https://www.geant.org/Projects/GEANT

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entry in the required format.
