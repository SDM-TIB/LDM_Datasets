To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Generation for Post-OCR Correction of Cyrillic Handwriting" by Evgenii Davydkin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a substantial dataset for training post-OCR correction models, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of OCR for Cyrillic handwriting and the need for large text corpora. This section may provide insights into the datasets they have used or created.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors describe their approach to generating synthetic handwriting and mention the need for corpora of handwritten essays, which suggests that there are datasets related to handwritten text.

I will then examine the **datasets section**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets they have utilized:

1. **HWR200 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 30,030 images of Russian handwritten text, curated for various research tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Ivan Potyashin, Mariam Kaprielova et al. *HWR200: New open access dataset of handwritten texts images in Russian*. [https://www.dialog-21.ru/media/5925/potyashiniplusetal048.pdf](https://www.dialog-21.ru/media/5925/potyashiniplusetal048.pdf).

2. **School_notebooks_RU Dataset**: This dataset contains images of school notebooks filled with handwritten notes in Russian, comprising 1,857 images. The citation for this dataset is:
   > ai-forever/school_notebooks_RU. *Russian school books dataset*. Datasets at Hugging Face. [https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai-forever/school_notebooks_RU](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai-forever/school_notebooks_RU).

3. **Student Essays Dataset**: This is an internally curated dataset of handwritten essays authored by students. The authors mention that they provide access to this dataset in their GitHub repository. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Dbrainio/CyrillicHandwritingPOC. *Repository for contributions for Data Generation for Post-OCR correction of Cyrillic handwriting paper*. GitHub. [https://github.com/dbrainio/CyrillicHandwritingPOC](https://github.com/dbrainio/CyrillicHandwritingPOC).

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each one, as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.
