To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Effectiveness of Unlearning in Session-Based Recommendation" by Liu Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets as follows:

1. **Amazon Beauty**: This dataset is part of a series of product review datasets crawled from Amazon.com, specifically focusing on beauty products.

2. **Amazon Games**: Similar to the Beauty dataset, this dataset is also part of the Amazon product review datasets, but it focuses on video games.

3. **Steam**: This dataset is collected from a large online video game distribution platform, Steam.

I will also check the **related work** and **methodology sections** to ensure that there are no additional datasets mentioned or relevant details about the datasets that might be useful for citation.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly, but it does mention that the Amazon datasets are publicly accessible and can be found at a specific URL. Therefore, I will include this URL in the citation.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- For **Amazon Beauty**:
  > J. McAuley and J. Leskovec. *From Amateurs to Connoisseurs: Modeling the Evolution of User Expertise through Online Reviews*. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information & Knowledge Management, 2013. Available at: https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/

- For **Amazon Games**:
  > J. McAuley and J. Leskovec. *From Amateurs to Connoisseurs: Modeling the Evolution of User Expertise through Online Reviews*. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information & Knowledge Management, 2013. Available at: https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/

- For **Steam**:
  > Steam Dataset. Available at: https://steam.internet.byu.edu/

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
