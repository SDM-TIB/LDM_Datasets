To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Design of CNNs via Differentiable Neural Architecture Search for PolSAR Image Classification" by Hongwei Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were conducted on "three PolSAR benchmark datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Methodology** section, particularly the **Experimental Results and Discussion** section, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **AIRSAR San Francisco**: This dataset is described as an L-band, full polarimetric image of San Francisco, with a size of 900×1024 pixels and a spatial resolution of 0.6m×1.6m. The dataset includes five categories: mountain, ocean, urban, vegetation, and bare soil.

2. **AIRSAR Flevoland**: This dataset is also an L-band, full polarimetric image, specifically of the agricultural region of the Netherlands, with a size of 750×1024 pixels and the same spatial resolution. It contains 15 categories of ground objects.

3. **ESAR Oberpfaffenhofen**: This dataset is another L-band, full polarimetric image, with a size of 1200×1300 pixels. It categorizes pixels into three categories: built-up areas, woodland, and open areas.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are typically included in the references of the paper, and I will ensure to extract them accurately.

For the **AIRSAR San Francisco dataset**, the citation is:
> "AIRSAR San Francisco dataset." [Online]. Available: [insert URL or DOI if available].

For the **AIRSAR Flevoland dataset**, the citation is:
> "AIRSAR Flevoland dataset." [Online]. Available: [insert URL or DOI if available].

For the **ESAR Oberpfaffenhofen dataset**, the citation is:
> "ESAR Oberpfaffenhofen dataset." [Online]. Available: [insert URL or DOI if available].

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
