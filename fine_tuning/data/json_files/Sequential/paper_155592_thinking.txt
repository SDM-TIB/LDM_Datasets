To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Approach to Network Intrusion Detection System Using Deep Learning for SDN: Futuristic Approach" by Mhmood Radhi Hadi and Adnan Saher Mohammed, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **NSL-KDD dataset** for their proposed approach, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed discussion of the NSL-KDD dataset. They mention that it is an updated version of the KDDCup99 dataset and contains 41 features, from which they extracted 12 features for their analysis. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides additional context about its structure and purpose.

In **section 4.1 (Data Preprocessing)**, the authors describe the preprocessing steps applied to the NSL-KDD dataset, including numericalization, normalization, and feature selection. This further emphasizes the dataset's importance in their methodology.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NSL-KDD dataset. The citation is as follows:
> M. Tavallaee, E. Bagheri, W. Lu, and A. A. Ghorbani. "A detailed analysis of the KDD CUP 99 data set." In Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Security and Defense Applications (CISDA), pages 1-6, 2009. doi: 10.1109/CISDA.2009.5356528.

Since the authors primarily focus on the NSL-KDD dataset, I will create an entry for this dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
