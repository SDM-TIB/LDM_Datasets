To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "A Simple and Efficient Ensemble Classifier Combining Multiple Neural Network Models on Social Media Datasets in Vietnamese" by Huy Duc Huynh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves classifying Vietnamese texts from three different benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **UIT-VSMEC**: This dataset consists of 6,927 emotion-annotated sentences with seven emotion labels: ENJOYMENT, SADNESS, ANGER, SURPRISE, FEAR, DISGUST, and OTHER. 

2. **UIT-VSFC**: This dataset includes 16,175 items derived from students' responses for sentiment classification, with two classification parts: sentiments (POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL) and topics (LECTURERS, TRAINING PROGRAM, FACILITIES, OTHER).

3. **HSD-VLSP**: This dataset is focused on hate speech detection and contains 25,431 items from comments and posts on Facebook, categorized into three labels: CLEAN, OFFENSIVE, and HATE.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **UIT-VSMEC**, the citation is:
  > K. V. Nguyen, Vu Duc Nguyen, P. X. V. Nguyen, T. T. T. Hong, N. L. Nguyen. *UIT-VSFC: Vietnamese students’ feedback corpus for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering (KSE), pages 19-24, 2018.

- For **UIT-VSFC**, the citation is:
  > P. X. V. Nguyen, T. T. T. Hong, K. V. Nguyen, N. L. Nguyen. *Deep Learning versus Traditional Classifiers on Vietnamese Students’ Feedback Corpus*. In Proceedings of the 5th NAFOSTED Conference on Information and Computer Science (NICS), pages 75-80, 2018.

- For **HSD-VLSP**, the citation is:
  > Vu Xuan-Son, Vu Thanh, Tran Mai-Vu, Le-Cong Thanh, Nguyen Huyen T M. *HSD shared task in VLSP campaign 2019: Hate speech detection for social good*. In Proceedings of VLSP 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the research paper.
