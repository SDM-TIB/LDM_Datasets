To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Turing Machines" by Alex Graves et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include mentions of datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

In this paper, the authors discuss various tasks and experiments, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets in the experiments section. However, they refer to the tasks they are testing, such as "copy," "repeat copy," "associative recall," and "dynamic N-grams." I will need to determine if these tasks are associated with any publicly available datasets or if they are synthetic datasets created for the purpose of the experiments.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might relate to datasets or prior works that introduced datasets relevant to the tasks discussed. This may include foundational papers or datasets that are commonly used in the field of neural networks and memory architectures.

After reviewing the references, I will compile the information I have gathered about any datasets mentioned or implied in the paper. If I find any datasets, I will ensure to write down their full citations accurately.

For example, if I find that the authors used synthetic datasets for their experiments, I will note that down and describe the nature of these datasets. If they referenced any established datasets, I will include those citations as well.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
