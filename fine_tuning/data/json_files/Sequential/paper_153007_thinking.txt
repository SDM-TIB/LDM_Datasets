To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantifying Exposure Bias for Open-ended Language Generation" by Tianxing He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the evaluation of exposure bias in language models, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction may provide more context or references to specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors mention using the **wiki-103 dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is crucial for their analysis of exposure bias in language generation.

I will then check the **experiments section** to gather more details about the wiki-103 dataset. The authors describe it as a large-scale dataset with around 1.8 million sentences and 101 million words for training, and 4,000 sentences and 241,000 words for testing. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's scope and application in their research.

After identifying the dataset, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the wiki-103 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> "The wiki-103 dataset is referenced in various works, but the specific citation for its use in this context is not provided in the paper. However, it is widely recognized in the NLP community as a benchmark dataset for language modeling."

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the wiki-103 dataset, I will note that it is commonly cited in related literature.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation as accurately as possible. This will help in documenting the datasets used in the research effectively.
