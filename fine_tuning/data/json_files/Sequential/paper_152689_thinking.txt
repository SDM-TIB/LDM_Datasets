To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bach2Bach: Generating Music Using A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach" by Nikhil Kotecha, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not list datasets directly, it can hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, particularly the subsections that discuss the necessary conditions for music generation. Here, the author mentions the importance of training data and references various datasets that could be relevant for the model's training.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets used for training the model. The author discusses several datasets, including:

1. **Bach Digital**: This dataset contains high-resolution scans of 90% of Bach's compositions. It is noted for its clear representation of Bach's work, making it a valuable resource for training the model.

2. **Bach Choral Harmony Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60 chorales by Bach, providing a textual representation of his work, including pitch classes and meter information.

3. **Bach’s Sheet Music**: Although referred to as lead sheets, this dataset includes significant portions of Bach's violin compositions, conveying key ideas of the pieces.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the means to access the datasets themselves.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **Bach Digital**:
  > Bach Digital. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.bach-digital.de/content/index.xed

- For **Bach Choral Harmony Dataset**:
  > UCI Machine Learning Repository. (2014). Bach Choral Harmony Dataset. Retrieved from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bach+Choral+Harmony

- For **Bach’s Sheet Music**:
  > The Violin Site. (n.d.). Bach Sheet Music. Retrieved from http://www.theviolinsite.com/sheet_music/bach/index.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly documented and easily accessible for future reference or use in related research.
