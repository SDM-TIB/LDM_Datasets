To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-time Forecasting of Time Series in Financial Markets Using Sequentially Trained Many-to-one LSTMs" by Kelum Gajamannage and Yonggi Park, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and performance analysis sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of LSTMs for predicting financial time series, which suggests that datasets from financial markets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention three types of financial markets: stocks, cryptocurrencies, and commodities. This indicates that the datasets may include time series data from these markets.

Next, I will focus on the **performance analysis section** where the authors explicitly list the financial time series used for their experiments. They mention nine datasets in total, categorized into three groups:

1. **Stocks**:
   - Apple
   - Microsoft
   - Google

2. **Cryptocurrencies**:
   - Bitcoin
   - Ethereum
   - Cardano

3. **Commodities**:
   - Gold
   - Crude Oil
   - Natural Gas

The authors provide specific details about the training and prediction lengths for each dataset in **Table 3**. This information is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are commonly used in financial research, they may not have specific citations in the references. Instead, I will note the general sources for these datasets:

- For **Apple, Microsoft, and Google stock prices**, the datasets can typically be sourced from financial market data providers like Yahoo Finance or Google Finance.
- For **Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano**, cryptocurrency data can be obtained from platforms like CoinMarketCap or Binance.
- For **Gold, Crude Oil, and Natural Gas prices**, these can be sourced from financial databases like the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) or financial market data providers.

Since the paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Apple Stock Prices**: Time series data of daily closing prices for Apple Inc.
2. **Microsoft Stock Prices**: Time series data of daily closing prices for Microsoft Corporation.
3. **Google Stock Prices**: Time series data of daily closing prices for Alphabet Inc. (Google).
4. **Bitcoin Prices**: Time series data of daily closing prices for Bitcoin.
5. **Ethereum Prices**: Time series data of daily closing prices for Ethereum.
6. **Cardano Prices**: Time series data of daily closing prices for Cardano.
7. **Gold Prices**: Time series data of daily closing prices for Gold.
8. **Crude Oil Prices**: Time series data of daily closing prices for Crude Oil.
9. **Natural Gas Prices**: Time series data of daily closing prices for Natural Gas.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly identifies each dataset along with its general source, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the descriptions.
