To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An autoencoder wavelet based deep neural network with attention mechanism for multistep prediction of plant growth" by Bashar Alhnaity et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present experimental results based on real datasets provided by European greenhouses, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental study section** (Section 5), where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention that the data was collected from four cultivation tables in a greenhouse in Belgium, specifically for predicting the growth of Ficus plants (Ficus benjamina). This section is likely to contain the most relevant information about the datasets used.

In Section 5.1, the authors provide details about the experimental setup, including the monitoring of stem diameter using a linear variable displacement transducer (LVDT) sensor. They state that the hourly variation rate of stem diameter was calculated, which indicates that the dataset consists of time-series data related to plant growth.

I will also check the **acknowledgements section**, where the authors thank growers for providing the datasets. This may lead to additional insights about the datasets' origins or specific names.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **Ficus Plant Growth Dataset**: This dataset includes hourly measurements of stem diameter variations collected from Ficus plants in a greenhouse setting. The data is used for multi-step prediction tasks.

Next, I will look for full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, I will note that the dataset is derived from the experimental setup described in the paper.

The citation for the paper itself is:
> Bashar Alhnaity, Stefanos Kollias, Georgios Leontidis, Shouyong Jiang, Bert Schamp, Simon Pearson. *An autoencoder wavelet based deep neural network with attention mechanism for multistep prediction of plant growth*. Preprint submitted to Elsevier, December 9, 2020.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information and prepare to format it according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the citation for the dataset as derived from the paper.
