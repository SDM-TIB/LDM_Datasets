To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large-Scale Spectrum Occupancy Learning via Tensor Decomposition and LSTM Networks" by Mohsen Joneidi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a **large-scale synthetic dataset**, which suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experimental results section**. Here, the authors describe their experiments involving a tensor of size F × T × N, where F is the number of frequency channels, T is the number of measurements per day, and N is the number of days. They mention that the dataset consists of 20 frequency channels, recorded 10 times an hour over 100 days, leading to a total of 240 measurements per day.

The authors also refer to the dataset as a **synthesized dataset** generated according to a joint probability distribution model. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, which is important for citation purposes.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any of the cited works provide datasets that could be relevant. However, the paper primarily discusses the synthetic dataset they created for their experiments, and no external datasets are explicitly mentioned.

Since the authors do not provide a formal citation for the synthetic dataset, I will note that it is a **synthetic dataset** created for the purpose of their study, and I will include a description of its characteristics (20 frequency channels, 240 measurements per day, over 100 days).

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly describe the dataset and note that it is a synthetic dataset created by the authors for their experiments.

In summary, the dataset extraction process involves:
1. Identifying the dataset mentioned in the abstract and experimental results.
2. Noting the characteristics of the synthetic dataset.
3. Acknowledging the lack of a formal citation for the dataset but describing it based on the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review, ensuring that it is clear and informative for future reference.
