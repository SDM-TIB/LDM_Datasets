To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Forward Architecture Search" by Hanzhang Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, Petridish, is evaluated on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using **CIFAR-10** and **Penn Tree Bank (PTB)** for their experiments. I will note down these datasets and look for specific details about them.

In the **CIFAR-10 section**, the authors describe it as a standard dataset for benchmarking image classification tasks. They mention that it consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, which is crucial information for my dataset extraction.

For the **Penn Tree Bank (PTB)**, the authors state that it is a standard dataset for benchmarking neural architecture search algorithms for RNNs. They mention that it has been widely used in the NAS community, which is also important to note.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, Alex. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

2. For **Penn Tree Bank (PTB)**, the citation is:
   > Marcus, Mitchell, Santorini, Beatrice, and Marcinkiewicz, Mary Ann. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. 1993.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
