To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VLSNR: Vision-Linguistics Coordination Time Sequence-aware News Recommendation" by Songhao Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the construction of a large-scale multimodal news recommendation dataset called **V-MIND**, which indicates that this is a key dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets they constructed and compared. Here, they specifically mention:

1. **MIND**: This is the original benchmark dataset for text-domain news recommendation, which serves as the foundation for their work.
2. **V-MIND**: This is the newly constructed dataset that includes visual information, enhancing the original MIND dataset.

In **section 4.1 (Dataset Establishment)**, the authors describe how they built the V-MIND dataset based on the MIND dataset, ensuring that every news item has corresponding images. They also provide statistics comparing MIND, IM-MIND, and V-MIND, which further confirms the significance of V-MIND.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

- For **MIND**, the citation is:
  > Chuhan Wu, Fangzhao Wu, Tao Qi, and Yongfeng Huang. *MIND: A large-scale dataset for news recommendation*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 3597â€“3606, 2020.

- For **V-MIND**, since it is a newly constructed dataset based on MIND, I will cite it as follows:
  > Songhao Han, Wei Huang, and Xiaotian Luan. *V-MIND: A multimodal news recommendation dataset*. (This citation may need to be formatted according to the specific publication details once available, as the paper indicates that the dataset will be released.)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
