To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SSH (Sketch, Shingle, & Hash) for Indexing Massive-Scale Time Series" by Chen Luo and Anshumali Shrivastava, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that empirical results were shown on "two large-scale benchmark time series data," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of similarity search in time series data and mention the datasets used for evaluation. They specifically refer to "ECG time series data" and "Random Walk time series data," which are likely the datasets used in their experiments.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention the datasets in the **experiments section** (Section 5). They describe the datasets as follows:

1. **ECG Time Series Data**: This dataset consists of 22 hours and 23 minutes of ECG data, totaling 20,140,000 data points. It is commonly used for testing similarity search methods.

2. **Random Walk Time Series Data**: This is a benchmark dataset often used for evaluating similarity search algorithms.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference the UCR Suite, which is a well-known source for time series datasets. The citation for the UCR Suite is:

- **UCR Suite**: 
  > Eamonn Keogh, et al. "Searching and mining trillions of time series subsequences under dynamic time warping." In Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pages 262â€“270, 2012.

Since the ECG and Random Walk datasets are part of the UCR Suite, I will use this citation for both datasets.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the datasets used in the research paper.
