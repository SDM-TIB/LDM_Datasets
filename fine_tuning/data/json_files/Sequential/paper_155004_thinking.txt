To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Thinking Clearly, Talking Fast: Concept-Guided Non-Autoregressive Generation for Open-Domain Dialogue Systems" by Yicheng Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **two public datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that they conducted experiments on **Persona-Chat** and **Weibo** datasets. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

In the paper, the authors provide the following details about the datasets:

1. **Persona-Chat**: This dataset consists of 101,935 training pairs, 5,602 validation pairs, and 5,317 testing pairs. It includes 2,409 concept vertices and 50,744 transition edges, with an average of 2.56 concepts per utterance.

2. **Weibo**: This dataset has 1,818,862 training pairs, 9,187 validation pairs, and 9,186 testing pairs. It contains 4,000 concept vertices and 74,362 transition edges, with an average of 1.61 concepts per utterance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Persona-Chat**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, H., Dinan, E., Urbanek, J., Szlam, A., Kiela, D., & Weston, J. (2018). Personalizing dialogue agents: I have a dog, do you have pets too? In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 2204–2213, Melbourne, Australia. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **Weibo**, the citation is:
  > Shang, L., Lu, Z., & Li, H. (2015). Neural responding machine for short-text conversation. In Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1577–1586, Beijing, China. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key details and citations for each dataset. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
