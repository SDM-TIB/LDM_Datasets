To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Speaker: an End-to-End Neural Speaker Embedding System" by Chao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three distinct datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset and Evaluation)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **UIDs Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing Mandarin speech from mobile queries, with three partitions: Train250k, Train50k, and Eva200. The statistics provided include the number of speakers, utterances, and average duration per utterance.

2. **XiaoDu Dataset**: This dataset consists of Baidu wake-word utterances and is also detailed in terms of the number of speakers and utterances for both training and testing.

3. **MTurk Dataset**: This dataset includes scripted English utterances collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk, and it is characterized by the number of speakers and utterances as well.

After identifying these datasets, I will need to gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **UIDs Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chao Li, Xiaokong Ma, Bing Jiang, Xiangang Li, Xuewei Zhang, Xiao Liu, Ying Cao, Ajay Kannan, Zhenyao Zhu. *Deep Speaker: an End-to-End Neural Speaker Embedding System*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2020.

- For the **XiaoDu Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chao Li, Xiaokong Ma, Bing Jiang, Xiangang Li, Xuewei Zhang, Xiao Liu, Ying Cao, Ajay Kannan, Zhenyao Zhu. *Deep Speaker: an End-to-End Neural Speaker Embedding System*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2020.

- For the **MTurk Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chao Li, Xiaokong Ma, Bing Jiang, Xiangang Li, Xuewei Zhang, Xiao Liu, Ying Cao, Ajay Kannan, Zhenyao Zhu. *Deep Speaker: an End-to-End Neural Speaker Embedding System*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
