To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining Face Presentation Attack Detection Using Natural Language" by Hengameh Mirzaalian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a dataset consisting of **1,105 bona-fide samples and 924 presentation attack samples**, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe the dataset as containing **1,105 bona-fide samples and 924 presentation attack samples**, with specific types of presentation attacks listed, such as funny glasses, printed paper, silicone masks, etc. Each presentation attack image is annotated with five descriptions generated by different annotators.

The authors also mention that the dataset can be obtained through their GitHub page, which is a crucial detail for citation purposes. The GitHub link provided is: **https://github.com/ISICV/PADISI_USC_Dataset**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the dataset appears to be newly introduced in this paper, and there may not be a separate citation for it in the references. Instead, I will treat the dataset as a product of this research paper.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the dataset details as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: USC PAD Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of 1,105 bona-fide samples and 924 presentation attack samples, annotated with five descriptions per image.
   - **Link**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ISICV/PADISI_USC_Dataset)
   - **Citation**: 
     > Hengameh Mirzaalian, Mohamed E. Hussein, Leonidas Spinoulas, Jonathan May, and Wael Abd-Almageed. *Explaining Face Presentation Attack Detection Using Natural Language*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 14851â€“14860, October 2021.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that the dataset entry is formatted correctly and ready for any further processing or review.
