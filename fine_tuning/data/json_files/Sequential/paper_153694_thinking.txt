To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Searching for Winograd-aware Quantized Networks" by Javier Fernandez-Marques et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work. In this case, the authors discuss the use of quantization and Winograd convolutions but do not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will look into the **experiments** section, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. I will specifically focus on any subsections that might be labeled as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." In this paper, the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for their experiments. 

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for training machine learning models in the field of computer vision.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class. It is also widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are typically attributed to the original paper by Alex Krizhevsky et al.

The full citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., et al. (2009). *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, University of Toronto.

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., et al. (2009). *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, University of Toronto.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
