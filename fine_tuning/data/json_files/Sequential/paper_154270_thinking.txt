To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-shot model-based adaptation in noisy conditions" by Karol Arndt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the challenges of few-shot adaptation in noisy conditions, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of sim-to-real transfer in robotics.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV) to identify any datasets used for evaluation. The authors describe their experimental setup, including the **FetchSlide environment** and the **Hockey puck setup**. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or data collection methods used in these experiments.

In the **FetchSlide section**, the authors mention collecting a set of **6.93 million hits under 28,875 random friction conditions in simulation**. This indicates a large dataset generated for the experiments, but I need to confirm if it has a formal name or citation.

In the **Hockey puck section**, they describe the experimental setup and mention using a **KUKA LBR4+ robot arm** and a **Kinect camera** for data collection. However, they do not explicitly name a dataset here, but they do refer to the data generated from the simulation and real-world experiments.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors reference several works, including those that may have provided datasets or methodologies for sim-to-real transfer.

From the information gathered, I will compile the datasets as follows:

1. **FetchSlide Dataset**: This dataset consists of 6.93 million hits collected under various friction conditions. While the authors do not provide a formal citation for this dataset, I will note that it is derived from the OpenAI Gym environment.

2. **Hockey Puck Dataset**: Similar to the FetchSlide dataset, this dataset is generated from the experimental setup involving the KUKA robot and Kinect camera. Again, no formal citation is provided, but it is based on the experimental conditions described in the paper.

Finally, I will ensure to provide full citations for any referenced works that may relate to the datasets, particularly those that describe the environments or methodologies used for data collection.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that I include all relevant details and citations as needed.
