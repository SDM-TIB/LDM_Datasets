To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Short-Term Memory Spiking Networks and Their Applications" by Ali Lotfi Rezaabad and Sriram Vishwanath, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include mentions of datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of their proposed LSTM spiking networks in various tasks, hinting at the use of datasets for empirical evaluations. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention several datasets:

1. **Sequential MNIST**: This dataset consists of handwritten digits and is a popular benchmark in machine learning, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The authors describe how they converted the images into a sequential format suitable for their model.

2. **Sequential EMNIST**: An extension of the MNIST dataset that includes both letters and digits, with 113,000 training samples and 19,000 test samples. The authors explain how they processed this dataset similarly to Sequential MNIST.

3. **Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland**: This dataset is used for character-level language modeling. The authors mention that they processed the text to create a suitable format for their model.

4. **Wikitext-2**: Another dataset used for language modeling, which the authors also preprocess for their experiments.

5. **FSDD (Free Spoken Digit Dataset)**: This dataset is used for speech classification tasks, consisting of recordings of digits spoken by different speakers. The authors describe how they transformed the audio samples for training.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
