To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Alternating ConvLSTM: Learning Force Propagation with Alternate State Updates" by Congyue Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions validating the model on the **Dynamic FAUST dataset**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors describe their setup. Here, they explicitly mention using the **Dynamic FAUST Dataset** for simulating human soft tissue dynamics. I will look for details about this dataset, such as its contents, structure, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

In the experiments section, the authors provide a detailed description of the **Dynamic FAUST Dataset**:
- It consists of **129 scanned 4D sequences** of human motions with soft tissue movement captured at **60 fps**. Each frame contains a tissue surface mesh with **6,890 vertices** and a skeletal pose that can be converted into an SMPL mesh model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Dynamic FAUST Dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:
> Federica Bogo, Javier Romero, Gerard Pons-Moll, and Michael J Black. *Dynamic FAUST: Registering Human Bodies in Motion*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 6233â€“6242, 2017.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **Dynamic FAUST Dataset** with the appropriate citation, ready for further processing or review.
