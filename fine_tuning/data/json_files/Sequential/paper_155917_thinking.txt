To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Model for Forecasting Air Quality Index in Port Harcourt Nigeria Using Bi-LSTM Algorithm" by O. E. Taylor and P. S. Ezekiel, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that air pollution data was downloaded from an online database (UCL), which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methodology section**. The authors mention that the data was collected using portable digital handheld particle monitors to measure PM2.5 and PM10 levels in Nigeria. They also describe the data collection process, including the time frame (Mayâ€“December 2018) and the conditions under which the data was collected.

In the **data collection section**, they provide a sample of the dataset, which includes various features such as date, wind speed (ws), wind direction (wd), temperature (temp), relative humidity (rh), rainfall (rfall), PM2.5, and PM10 levels. This confirms the existence of a structured dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that the air pollution data was downloaded from an online database (UCL), but they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset in the references. Therefore, I will need to look up the UCL database to find the appropriate citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and formatted correctly.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant information is included and accurately represented.
