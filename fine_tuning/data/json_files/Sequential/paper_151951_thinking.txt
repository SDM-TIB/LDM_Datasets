To extract datasets from the research paper titled "E-PUR: An Energy-Efficient Processing Unit for Recurrent Neural Networks" by Franyell Silfa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the applications of LSTM networks. They mention various tasks such as speech recognition and machine translation, which may imply the use of specific datasets, but I need to find explicit mentions.

I will then examine the **evaluation methodology section** (Section 4) closely, as it typically contains details about the datasets used for experiments. In this section, the authors list five LSTM networks used for their experiments, which may correspond to specific datasets. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or provide references.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the following datasets used for their experiments:

1. **BYSDNE Dataset**: Used for video classification tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > J. Yue-Hei Ng, M. Hausknecht, S. Vijayanarasimhan, O. Vinyals, R. Monga, and G. Toderici. *Beyond short snippets: Deep networks for video classification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 4694–4702, 2015.

2. **RLDRADSPR Dataset**: Used for speech recognition tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > J. Kim, M. El-Khamy, and J. Lee. *Residual LSTM: Design of a deep recurrent architecture for distant speech recognition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1701.03360, 2017.

3. **EESEN Dataset**: Also used for speech recognition. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Y. Miao, M. Gowayyed, and F. Metze. *Eesen: End-to-end speech recognition using deep RNN models and WFST-based decoding*. In Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding (ASRU), 2015 IEEE Workshop on, pp. 167–174, IEEE, 2015.

4. **LDLRNN Dataset**: Used for time series analysis. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Z. C. Lipton, D. C. Kale, C. Elkan, and R. Wetzell. *Learning to diagnose with LSTM recurrent neural networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.03677, 2015.

5. **GMAT Dataset**: Used for machine translation tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Y. Wu, M. Schuster, Z. Chen, Q. V. Le, M. Norouzi, W. Macherey, M. Krikun, Y. Cao, Q. Gao, K. Macherey, et al. *Google’s neural machine translation system: Bridging the gap between human and machine translation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.08144, 2016.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have the correct formatting for each citation and compile them into a structured format for further use.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that the citations are complete and accurate for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
