To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Harmonic Gated Compensation Network Plus for ICASSP 2022 DNS Challenge" by Tianrui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors generated data for the DNS Challenge, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their dataset generation process. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **DNS-2020 Dataset**: The authors generated 100 hours of wide-band (WB) data using speech and noise provided by the INTERSPEECH 2020 DNS Challenge. They specify that the data was divided into training and validation sets in a 4:1 ratio and that they created 540 noisy-clean pairs for testing.

2. **DNS-2022 Dataset**: For the ICASSP 2022 DNS Challenge, the authors generated a full-band (FB) dataset with 3500 hours of duration using provided noise and various language data. They also mention that half of the utterances were convolved with random synthetic and real room impulse responses (RIRs).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **DNS-2020 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. K. A. Reddy et al., “The interspeech 2020 deep noise suppression challenge: Datasets, subjective speech quality and testing framework,” arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.08662, 2020.

- For the **DNS-2022 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Cutler et al., “ICASSP 2022 Deep Noise Suppression Challenge,” in IEEE ICASSP, 2022, pp. 46–50.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or processing.
