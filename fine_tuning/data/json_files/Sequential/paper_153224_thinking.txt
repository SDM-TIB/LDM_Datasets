To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Attribute Representation and Injection for Sentiment Classification" by Reinald Kim Amplayo, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on sentiment classification using user and product information, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any mention of datasets used for sentiment classification. In the paper, the authors explicitly list three datasets in **Table 1** under the "Datasets" section:

1. **IMDB**: This dataset is commonly used for sentiment analysis and contains a total of 67,426 training samples, 8,381 development samples, and 9,112 test samples. The authors also provide statistics about the number of users and products associated with this dataset.

2. **Yelp 2013**: This dataset includes 62,522 training samples, 7,773 development samples, and 8,671 test samples. Similar to IMDB, it also includes user and product statistics.

3. **Yelp 2014**: This dataset has 183,019 training samples, 22,745 development samples, and 25,399 test samples, along with user and product statistics.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the datasets as follows:

- For **IMDB**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142–150, 2011.

- For **Yelp 2013**, the citation is:
  > Tang, B., Qin, Y., & Liu, T. (2015). *Learning semantic representations of users and products for document level sentiment classification*. In Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing of the Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing, ACL 2015, July 26-31, 2015, Beijing, China, Volume 1: Long Papers, pages 1014–1023.

- For **Yelp 2014**, the citation is the same as for Yelp 2013, as it is part of the same dataset collection.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I include all relevant details such as the number of samples, users, and products for each dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
