To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Testing the limits of unsupervised learning for semantic similarity" by Richa Sharma and Muktabh Srivastava, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses generating sentence embeddings and evaluating LSTM autoencoders, but it does not mention specific datasets yet.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of generating satisfactory representations of phrases and sentences. However, they do not specify any datasets here either.

Moving on to the **results section**, I will look for any mentions of datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors state that they performed unsupervised evaluation of the learnt sentence embeddings using the **STS 2014** and **SICK 2014** datasets. This is a crucial finding as it indicates the datasets used for their experiments.

In the **results section**, they provide details about the SICK dataset, mentioning that it consists of about 10,000 sentence pairs along with relatedness scores ranging from 0 to 5. They also mention the STS 2014 dataset, which contains 3,770 pairs of sentences. This confirms that both datasets are integral to their evaluation process.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **STS 2014 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Eneko Agirre, Nigo Lopez-Gazpio, and Lucia Specia. *SemEval-2017 Task 1: Semantic Textual Similarity Multilingual and Cross-lingual Focused Evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2017), pages 1–14, 2017.

- For the **SICK 2014 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marco Marelli, Luisa Bentivogli, Marco Baroni, Stefano Menini, Roberto Zamparelli, and Raffaella Bernardi. *SemEval-2014 Task 1: Evaluation of Compositional Distributional Semantic Models on Full Sentences through Semantic Relatedness and Textual Entailment*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2014), pages 1–8, 2014.

With these citations in hand, I will now summarize the datasets:

1. **STS 2014 Dataset**: Contains 3,770 pairs of sentences used for evaluating semantic textual similarity.
   - Citation: Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Eneko Agirre, Nigo Lopez-Gazpio, and Lucia Specia. *SemEval-2017 Task 1: Semantic Textual Similarity Multilingual and Cross-lingual Focused Evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2017), pages 1–14, 2017.

2. **SICK 2014 Dataset**: Comprises about 10,000 sentence pairs with relatedness scores ranging from 0 to 5, used for evaluating semantic similarity.
   - Citation: Marco Marelli, Luisa Bentivogli, Marco Baroni, Stefano Menini, Roberto Zamparelli, and Raffaella Bernardi. *SemEval-2014 Task 1: Evaluation of Compositional Distributional Semantic Models on Full Sentences through Semantic Relatedness and Textual Entailment*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2014), pages 1–8, 2014.

Finally, I will compile these dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
