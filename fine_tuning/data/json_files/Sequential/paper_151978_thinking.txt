To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised and Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection with LSTM Neural Networks" by Tolga Ergen, Ali H. Mirza, and Suleyman S. Kozat, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments. I will note down the names and descriptions of these datasets as I find them. For example, they mention the **digit dataset**, which contains pixel samples of digits written by different authors, and the **occupancy dataset**, which includes features related to room occupancy.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for any papers or resources cited that provide the datasets or describe them in detail.

For instance, the digit dataset is referenced as:
> M. Lichman, “UCI machine learning repository,” 2013.

And the occupancy dataset is cited as:
> L. M. Candanedo and V. Feldheim, “Accurate occupancy detection of an office room from light, temperature, humidity and CO2 measurements using statistical learning models,” Energy and Buildings, vol. 112, pp. 28–39, 2016.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, as this is essential for proper documentation and future use.
