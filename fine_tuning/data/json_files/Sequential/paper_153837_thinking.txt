To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoHR: A Strong End-to-end Baseline for Remote Heart Rate Measurement with Neural Searching" by Zitong Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that comprehensive experiments are performed on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they state that three public datasets are employed for their experiments: **VIPL-HR**, **MAHNOB-HCI**, and **MMSE-HR**. I will take note of the context in which these datasets are used, including any specific details about their characteristics or the nature of the data.

In the **appendix**, the authors provide additional details about each dataset, including the number of videos, subjects, and the ground truth data used for evaluation. This information is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of each dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**:

1. **VIPL-HR Dataset**: The citation is:
   > X. Niu, S. Shan, H. Han, and X. Chen. *RhythmNet: End-to-end heart rate estimation from face via spatial-temporal representation*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 2019.

2. **MAHNOB-HCI Dataset**: The citation is:
   > M. Soleymani, J. Lichtenauer, T. Pun, and M. Pantic. *A multimodal database for affect recognition and implicit tagging*. IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, vol. 3, no. 1, pp. 42–55, 2011.

3. **MMSE-HR Dataset**: The citation is:
   > S. Tulyakov, X. Alameda-Pineda, E. Ricci, L. Yin, J. F. Cohn, and N. Sebe. *Self-adaptive matrix completion for heart rate estimation from face videos under realistic conditions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016, pp. 2396–2404.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset's significance in the research. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive dataset entry for further processing or review.
