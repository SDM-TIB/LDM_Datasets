To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Autoencoders and Adversarial LSTM for Improved Forecasts of Urban Air Pollution Simulations" by César Quilodrán-Casas et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses improving forecasts of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or specific dataset names.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly any subsections that might detail the data used for the experiments. This section often contains crucial information about the datasets, including their sources, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors describe the use of a **3D case simulation** of urban air pollution in South London, which suggests that the data is derived from CFD simulations rather than traditional datasets. I will look for any references to specific datasets or data sources used in the simulations.

I will also check the **results and discussion section** for any additional insights or clarifications regarding the datasets. If the authors refer to any datasets or data sources in their results, it will be important to note them.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or data sources mentioned in the paper. If the authors refer to previous works that utilized specific datasets, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset mentioned or implied in the paper. If no specific datasets are identified, I will note that the data used is derived from CFD simulations without a traditional dataset citation.

This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
