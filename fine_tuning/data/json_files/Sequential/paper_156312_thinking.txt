To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing Political Figures in Real-Time: Leveraging YouTube Metadata for Sentiment Analysis" by Danendra Athallariq Harya Putra and Arief Purnama Muharram, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides an overview of the study's focus on sentiment analysis using YouTube video metadata, which suggests that the dataset is derived from YouTube.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the parts discussing data gathering and the sentiment analysis model. The authors mention that they retrieve data streams from the YouTube API, specifically using the video descriptions as metadata for sentiment analysis. This indicates that the dataset consists of YouTube video metadata, but I need to confirm if there are specific datasets or sources cited.

In the **methodology**, the authors detail their data gathering process, indicating that they use keywords related to political figures to search for relevant videos on YouTube. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name for the YouTube metadata itself, as it is dynamically retrieved from the API based on the search keywords.

The authors also mention using a **sentiment dataset from the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election (Pilkada)**, which is crucial for the sentiment analysis model. This dataset is derived from social media Twitter and consists of two types of sentiment (positive and negative). The paper states that this dataset has been preprocessed and is used to train the sentiment analysis model.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election sentiment dataset**, the citation is:
   > A. R. T. Lestari, R. S. Perdana, and M. A. Fauzi. "Analisis Sentimen Tentang Opini Pilkada DKI 2017 Pada Dokumen Twitter Berbahasa Indonesia Menggunakan Naive Bayes dan Pembobotan Emoji." In Jurnal Pengembangan Teknologi Informasi Dan Ilmu Komputer, vol. 1, no. 12, pp. 1718-1724, 2017. [Online]. Available: https://j-ptiik.ub.ac.id/index.php/j-ptiik/article/view/627. Accessed: September 20, 2023.

Since the YouTube metadata is not a specific dataset with a formal citation but rather a collection of data retrieved via the YouTube API, I will note that it is dynamically generated based on the search keywords related to political figures.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:

1. **YouTube Video Metadata**: Dynamic dataset retrieved via the YouTube API based on keywords related to political figures. (No formal citation as it is not a static dataset).
2. **2017 Jakarta Gubernatorial Election Sentiment Dataset**: A dataset used for training the sentiment analysis model.

Now, I will compile these findings into a structured format for further processing or review.
