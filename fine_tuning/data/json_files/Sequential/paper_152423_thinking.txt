To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weakly-Supervised Deep Recurrent Neural Networks for Basic Dance Step Generation" by Nelson Yalta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on dance generation, but I need to look for specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they prepared three datasets due to a lack of available datasets that include dance synchronized to music. The datasets are:

1. **Hip hop bounce**: This dataset consists of two hip hop music tracks, each approximately three minutes long, with a repetitive lateral bouncing step to match the rhythm.

2. **Salsa**: This dataset includes seven salsa tracks, averaging four minutes in length, featuring various rhythms and dance steps.

3. **Mixed**: This dataset comprises 13 music tracks from six different genres (salsa, bachata, ballad, hip hop, rock, and bossa nova), with an average length of three minutes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are original contributions of the authors and may not have formal citations. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and any relevant details:

- **Hip hop bounce**: Two hip hop music tracks with a repetitive lateral bouncing step, each track approximately three minutes long at 80 to 95 beats per minute (bpm).

- **Salsa**: Seven salsa tracks, averaging four minutes long, with rhythms between 95 to 130 bpm, including various dance steps.

- **Mixed**: 13 music tracks from six genres, averaging three minutes long, with up to two dance steps per track.

Since these datasets are not derived from previously published works, they do not have formal citations. Instead, I will document the information as provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that all relevant details are included for each dataset.
