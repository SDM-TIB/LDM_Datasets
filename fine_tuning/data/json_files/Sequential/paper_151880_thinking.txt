To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Neural Networks for Bot Detection" by Sneha Kudugunta and Emilio Ferrara, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used in their work. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of a mixture of genuine accounts and various types of social spambots, with specific counts of accounts and tweets. The dataset is characterized by the following breakdown:

- **Genuine accounts**: 3,474 accounts with 8,377,522 tweets.
- **Social spambots #1**: 991 accounts with 1,610,176 tweets.
- **Social spambots #2**: 3,457 accounts with 428,542 tweets.
- **Social spambots #3**: 464 accounts with 1,418,626 tweets.

The authors also mention that the dataset was obtained from Cresci and collaborators, which indicates that there is a reference to a prior work that details this dataset.

To ensure I have the full citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the dataset from Cresci et al.:
  > Stefano Cresci, Roberto Di Pietro, Marinella Petrocchi, Angelo Spognardi, and Maurizio Tesconi. *The paradigm-shift of social spambots: Evidence, theories, and tools for the arms race*. In Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion, pages 963â€“972, 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset information clearly, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
