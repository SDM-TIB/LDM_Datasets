To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning-based Predictive Beamforming for Integrated Sensing and Communication in Vehicular Networks" by Chang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise summary of the research, including any datasets used. In this case, the abstract discusses the development of a deep learning approach for predictive beamforming, which may imply the use of datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** to identify any specific datasets mentioned. The authors may reference datasets that are commonly used in vehicular networks or integrated sensing and communication research.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments sections**. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training their models or for evaluation purposes. If the paper includes simulation results, it may also reference the datasets used to generate those results.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Dataset," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is not explicitly cited, I will note the details provided in the paper and search for the original source online if necessary.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets along with their full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which can be useful for further studies or replication of the experiments.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation, making it easy for others to reference or utilize the datasets in their own work.
