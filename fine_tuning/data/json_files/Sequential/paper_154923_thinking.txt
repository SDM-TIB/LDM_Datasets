To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Random Convolution Kernels with Multi-Scale Decomposition for Preterm EEG Inter-burst Detection" by Christopher Lundy and John M. O’Toole, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I will focus on sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research but do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will move on to the **materials and methods section**, which is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used.

In **section II.A (Preterm EEG data set)**, the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that individual EEG recordings were acquired from **36 preterm infants** within 72 hours of birth in the NICU of the Cork University Maternity Hospital, Ireland. The gestational age of the infants ranged from **23.4 to 29.7 weeks**. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the number of subjects, the context of data collection, and the equipment used.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to a previous work for more details about the EEG dataset:

- For the EEG dataset, the citation is:
  > O’Toole, J. M., Boylan, G. B., Lloyd, R. O., Goulding, R. M., Vanhatalo, S., & Stevenson, N. J. (2017). *Detecting bursts in the EEG of very and extremely premature infants using a multi-feature approach*. Medical Engineering & Physics, 45, 42-50.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, I have extracted the following dataset from the paper:

1. **Preterm EEG Dataset**: EEG recordings from 36 preterm infants, collected in a clinical setting, with specific details about the gestational age and data collection methods.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> O’Toole, J. M., Boylan, G. B., Lloyd, R. O., Goulding, R. M., Vanhatalo, S., & Stevenson, N. J. (2017). *Detecting bursts in the EEG of very and extremely premature infants using a multi-feature approach*. Medical Engineering & Physics, 45, 42-50.

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review.
