To extract datasets from the research paper titled "As easy as APC: overcoming missing data and class imbalance in time series with self-supervised learning" by Fiorella Wever et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their method to a synthetic dataset and two real-world medical time-series datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the **Datasets subsection**. Here, the authors describe three datasets:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is generated with controlled levels of missingness and class imbalance. It consists of time-series data with two variables: a continuous variable (simulated as a noisy sine curve) and a binary variable (Bernoulli). The output is a non-linear function of these variables.

2. **Physionet Dataset**: This is a benchmark dataset from the Physionet Challenge 2012, used for predicting whether an ICU patient will survive or die during their hospital stay. The dataset has an average of 79.75% missing values and is characterized by a significant class imbalance (86% majority class).

3. **Clue Dataset**: This dataset is derived from a menstrual cycle tracking app and aims to predict the discontinuation of birth control methods over time. It contains an average of 70.29% missing values and also exhibits a severe class imbalance (92% majority class).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Physionet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Goldberger, A. L., Amaral, L. A., Glass, L., Hausdorff, J. M., Ivanov, P. C., Mark, R. G., ... & Stanley, H. E. (2000). PhysioBank, PhysioToolkit, and PhysioNet: components of a new research resource for complex physiologic signals. *Circulation*, 101(23), e215-e220.

- For the **Clue Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Clue by BioWink GmbH (2020). URL: https://helloclue.com/. Adalbertstra√üe 7-8, 10999 Berlin, Germany.

The synthetic dataset does not have a formal citation as it is generated by the authors for the purpose of their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that all relevant information is captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
