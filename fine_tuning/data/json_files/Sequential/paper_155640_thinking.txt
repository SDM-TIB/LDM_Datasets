To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiple Object Tracking in Recent Times: A Literature Review" by Mk Bashar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper includes "popular benchmark datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss datasets directly. I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "MOT Benchmarks" or "Datasets." In the provided text, there is a section titled **IV. MOT BENCHMARKS**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in multiple object tracking research.

In this section, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **MOT15**: This dataset contains various scenes filmed in unconstrained environments with both static and moving cameras.
2. **MOT16**: An updated benchmark from MOT15 with higher accuracy ground truth.
3. **MOT17**: Another updated benchmark that continues to improve upon the previous datasets.
4. **MOT20**: A pedestrian detection challenge with challenging video sequences.
5. **PETS**: A dataset used for various tracking challenges.
6. **KITTI**: A well-known dataset for autonomous driving and tracking tasks.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations will typically include the authors, title of the work, publication venue, and year. For example, the citation for the MOT datasets can be found in the references as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, which is crucial for any further analysis or research based on this work.
