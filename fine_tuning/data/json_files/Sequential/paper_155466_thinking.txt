To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Tuberculosis and COVID-19 cough classification using deep learning" by Madhurananda Pahar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves cough audio recordings from various subjects, which suggests that multiple datasets are likely used.

Next, I will focus on **Section II (Data)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for both pre-training and classification tasks. This section is crucial as it explicitly lists the datasets and their characteristics.

In **Section II.A (Cough audio data for classification)**, the authors describe six datasets used for cough classification:

1. **TASK dataset**: Contains 6000 continuous cough recordings from 47 TB patients.
2. **Brooklyn dataset**: Includes cough audio from 17 TB and 21 healthy subjects.
3. **Wallacedene dataset**: Comprises 402 coughs from 16 TB patients.
4. **Coswara dataset**: A publicly available dataset with coughs from 92 COVID-19 positives and 1079 healthy subjects.
5. **ComParE dataset**: Contains cough audio from 119 COVID-19 positives and 398 healthy subjects.
6. **Sarcos dataset**: Includes coughs from 18 COVID-19 positive subjects.

In **Section II.B (Datasets without cough labels for pre-training)**, the authors mention additional datasets used for pre-training the deep learning models:

1. **Google Audio Set & Freesound**: Contains various audio events, including sneezes and speech.
2. **LibriSpeech**: A corpus of audiobooks used for speech recognition.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide context for each dataset.

For the datasets mentioned in the classification task, I will look for the following citations:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing.
