To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HSCJN: A Holistic Semantic Constraint Joint Network for Diverse Response Generation" by Yiru Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in dialogue systems and the need for diverse responses, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **DailyDialog**: This dataset is described as containing 13,118 multi-turn dialogues, which are divided into training, validation, and test sets. The authors also mention that they removed dialogues with more than 300 tokens for computational efficiency.

2. **OpenSubtitles**: This dataset consists of movie subtitles, and the authors explain how they treat each turn in the dataset as the target text, using the two previous sentences as the source text. They also specify the number of dialogues sampled for training, validation, and testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DailyDialog**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Su, H., Shen, X., Li, W., Cao, Z., & Niu, S. (2017). DailyDialog: A manually labelled multi-turn dialogue dataset. In IJCNLP 2017, Taipei, Taiwan, November 27 - December 1, 2017 - Volume 1: Long Papers, pages 986–995.

- For **OpenSubtitles**, the citation is:
  > Tiedemann, J. (2012). Parallel data, tools and interfaces in OPUS. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, LREC 2012, Istanbul, Turkey, May 23-25, 2012, pages 2214–2218.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
