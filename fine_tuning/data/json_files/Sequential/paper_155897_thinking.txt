To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Benchmark for Toxic Comment Classification on Civil Comments Dataset" by Corentin DuchÃªne et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper compares models on a multi-label hate speech dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methodology)**, particularly the subsection titled **2.1 Dataset**. Here, the authors describe the **Civil Comments dataset**, which consists of 1.8 million comments made public by the Civil Comments platform. This dataset is crucial for the study as it is the primary dataset used for the experiments.

In this section, the authors provide details about how the dataset was annotated, including the number of annotators and the categories into which comments were classified. They also mention that a subset of 450,000 examples was tagged with identity information, which is relevant for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Civil Comments dataset. The authors reference the dataset as being provided by Jigsaw/Conversation AI, and I will ensure to include this in the citation.

The full citation for the Civil Comments dataset is:
> Jigsaw/Conversation AI. *Civil Comments Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/data.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Civil Comments Dataset**: A multi-label dataset containing 1.8 million comments, annotated for toxicity and identity categories. The dataset is used to evaluate the performance of various models in detecting toxic comments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
