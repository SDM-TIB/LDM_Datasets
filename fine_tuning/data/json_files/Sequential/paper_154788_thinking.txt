To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Rumor Detection in Finnish News: a Dataset and a Baseline" by Mika Hämäläinen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract states that the study presents a new dataset for rumor detection in Finnish language news headlines, which indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the novelty of their work in the context of Finnish language rumor detection. They mention that they propose a new dataset, which reinforces the idea that I need to gather details about this dataset.

In the **data section (Section 3)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset they created. They mention that they collected data from a Finnish news aggregation website, crawling headlines categorized as rumors and factual news. The dataset consists of 3,896 samples, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing. This section is crucial as it provides the necessary details about the dataset's composition and structure.

The authors also mention that the dataset is freely available for download on Zenodo, which is an important detail for citation purposes. I will need to note the DOI provided for the dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a separate citation for the dataset itself, but they do mention that it is available on Zenodo with a permanent DOI. I will use this information to construct the citation.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Mika Hämäläinen, Khalid Alnajjar, Niko Partanen, and Jack Rueter. *Rumor Detection in Finnish News: a Dataset and a Baseline*. Zenodo. DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.4697529.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the steps I took to extract the dataset were:
1. Read the abstract to identify the presence of a dataset.
2. Review the introduction for context and confirmation of the dataset's novelty.
3. Analyze the data section for detailed information about the dataset's composition and availability.
4. Locate the full citation in the references or note the DOI for proper attribution.

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entry for further use.
