To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural News Recommendation with Long-term and Short-term Interest Modeling" by Linmei Hua et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are based on "real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they specifically mention the **Adressa dataset**, which is described in detail. The authors provide information about the dataset's characteristics, including its size and the nature of the data it contains.

In Section 5.1, the authors describe the **Adressa dataset** as follows:
- It is a click log dataset with approximately 20 million page visits from a Norwegian news portal.
- The dataset includes anonymized users with their clicked news logs and contextual information about users, such as geographical location and active time.

The authors also mention two specific versions of the dataset:
1. **Adressa-1week**: This version collects news click logs for one week (from January 1 to January 7, 2017).
2. **Adressa-10week**: This version collects news click logs for ten weeks (from January 1 to March 31, 2017).

The authors provide a link to the dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the Adressa dataset is:
> J. A. Gulla, L. Zhang, P. Liu, Ö. Özgöbek, X. Su. *The Adressa dataset for news recommendation*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Web Intelligence, ACM, 2017, pp. 1042–1048.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Adressa Dataset**: A comprehensive click log dataset with approximately 20 million page visits, including anonymized user interactions and contextual information.
   - Citation: J. A. Gulla, L. Zhang, P. Liu, Ö. Özgöbek, X. Su. *The Adressa dataset for news recommendation*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Web Intelligence, ACM, 2017, pp. 1042–1048.

2. **Adressa-1week**: A version of the Adressa dataset that collects news click logs for one week.
3. **Adressa-10week**: A version of the Adressa dataset that collects news click logs for ten weeks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset.
