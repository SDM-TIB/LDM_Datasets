To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Controllable Dialogue Generation with Disentangled Multi-grained Style Specification and Attribute Consistency Reward" by Zhe Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of controllable dialogue generation and mention the datasets used for evaluation. They specifically state that they conducted experiments on **Persona-Chat** and **DailyDialog** datasets, which are crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this case, the authors provide a summary of the datasets in **Table I**, which includes the number of training, validation, and test samples for both datasets:

1. **Persona-Chat**: 
   - Training samples: 122,343
   - Validation samples: 14,602
   - Test samples: 14,056

2. **DailyDialog**: 
   - Training samples: 69,107
   - Validation samples: 6,458
   - Test samples: 6,128

This confirms the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
