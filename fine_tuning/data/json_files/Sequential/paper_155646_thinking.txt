To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Linear Transformations for Cross-lingual Sentiment Analysis" by Pavel Pˇrib´aˇn et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper deals with cross-lingual sentiment analysis and mentions the use of datasets from the movie reviews domain, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **CSFD Dataset**: This dataset consists of 90,000 movie reviews from the Czech movie database, annotated based on star ratings. The authors clarify that they only use examples labeled as positive or negative.

2. **Allocine Dataset**: This French dataset contains 100,000 positive and 100,000 negative reviews, scraped from the Allociné website, and annotated similarly to the CSFD dataset.

3. **IMDB Dataset**: This English dataset includes 50,000 movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database, with positive and negative classes. The authors mention that they randomly selected 2,500 examples from the training part as development data.

4. **SST-2 Dataset**: This dataset contains nearly 12,000 manually annotated movie reviews categorized into two classes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **CSFD Dataset**:
  > Habernal, I., Ptáček, T., Steinberger, J. (2013). *Sentiment analysis in Czech social media using supervised machine learning*. In Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity and Social Media Analysis.

- For the **Allocine Dataset**:
  > Barriere, V., Balahur, A. (2020). *Improving sentiment analysis over non-English tweets using multilingual transformers and automatic translation for data-augmentation*. In Proceedings of the 28th COLING.

- For the **IMDB Dataset**:
  > Maas, A.L., Daly, R.E., Pham, P.T., Huang, D., Ng, A.Y., Potts, C. (2011). *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **SST-2 Dataset**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
