To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pain Assessment based on fNIRS using Bidirectional LSTMs" by Raul Fernandez Rojas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and deep learning for pain assessment, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to fNIRS data.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **Experimental Procedure** subsection, where the authors describe the experimental setup and the data collection process. Here, they mention that the dataset was organized into four categories based on pain levels: low-cold, low-heat, high-cold, and high-heat. This indicates that the authors created a dataset from their experiments, but I need to find more details about it.

In the **Results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models on the dataset, which further confirms its existence. However, I need to look for specific names or references to the dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to see if the authors cite any existing datasets or provide details about the dataset they created. If they mention any previous studies or datasets that they used or compared against, I will note those citations as well.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile the information about the dataset(s) identified:

1. **fNIRS Pain Dataset**: This dataset was created from the experiments conducted in the study, which involved 18 right-handed volunteers. The dataset includes fNIRS data categorized into four pain levels based on thermal stimuli.

Next, I will ensure to provide the full citation for the dataset as described in the paper. Since the dataset is derived from the authors' own experiments, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Raul Fernandez Rojas, Julio Romero, Jehu Lopez-Aparicio, and Keng-Liang Ou. *Pain Assessment based on fNIRS using Bidirectional LSTMs*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [pages], [year].

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry with the necessary details, ensuring that the citation is included as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant information accurately and comprehensively.
