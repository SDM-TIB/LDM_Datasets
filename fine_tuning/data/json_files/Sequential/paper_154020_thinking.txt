To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long-term Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction using Mutable Intention Filter and Warp LSTM" by Zhe Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on a "publicly available dataset," which suggests that a dataset is indeed used, but I need to find its name.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **Edinburgh Informatics Forum database**, which includes around 90,000 trajectories recorded at a frame rate of 10Hz. This is a clear identification of the dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Edinburgh Informatics Forum database. The citation is as follows:
> B. Majecka, “Statistical models of pedestrian behaviour in the forum,” M.S. thesis, Sch. Info., Univ. Edinb., Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2009.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:
1. **Dataset Name**: Edinburgh Informatics Forum database
   - **Description**: A dataset that includes around 90,000 trajectories recorded at a frame rate of 10Hz, used for evaluating pedestrian trajectory prediction methods.

Finally, I will prepare to format this information according to the specified requirements, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
