To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Risk Prediction of Peer-to-Peer Lending Market by a LSTM Model with Macroeconomic Factor" by Yan Wang and Xuelei Sherry Ni, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study uses data from the Lending Club, which is a significant hint that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Empirical Study)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their analysis. Here, they mention that they used the **Lending Club data**, which records P2P lending transactions from 2007 to 2017. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including its scope, features, and the target variable.

In this subsection, the authors also mention that they collected a macroeconomic feature, the **unemployment rate (unemp_rate)**, which is recorded monthly and serves as an additional numerical feature in their analysis. This indicates that there are two datasets of interest: the Lending Club dataset and the unemployment rate dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The Lending Club dataset is typically referenced in studies but may not have a formal citation in the paper. However, I can provide a general reference for it based on its common usage:

- For the **Lending Club dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lending Club. *Lending Club Data*. Available at: https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action.

- For the **unemployment rate data**, I will reference the source mentioned in the paper:
  > U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. *Unemployment Rate Data*. Available at: https://datahub.io/core/employment-us#data.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
