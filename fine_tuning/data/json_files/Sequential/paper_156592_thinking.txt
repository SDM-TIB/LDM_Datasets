To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DouRN: Improving DouZero by Residual Neural Networks" by Yiquan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the performance of the DouRN model in the card game Doudizhu but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of applying reinforcement learning to Doudizhu but again does not reference any specific datasets.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) to see if any datasets are mentioned in the context of training or evaluation. The experiments primarily focus on comparing the performance of the DouRN model against the DouZero model and human players, but they do not specify any datasets used for training or evaluation.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will check the **references section** for any potential datasets that might be cited indirectly through other works. The references include various papers related to reinforcement learning and Doudizhu, but they do not provide specific datasets either.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned or cited. The authors focus on the model's architecture and performance metrics rather than on specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

In conclusion, I will note that no datasets were extracted from this paper, as the authors did not provide any specific datasets or references to datasets in their work. Therefore, there are no citations to compile for datasets in this case.
