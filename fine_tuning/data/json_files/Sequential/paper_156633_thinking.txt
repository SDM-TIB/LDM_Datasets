To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Function Approximation for Reinforcement Learning Controller for Energy from Spread Waves" by Soumyendu Sarkar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on wave energy converters and the use of reinforcement learning, but it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the CETO 6 Wave Energy Converter (WEC) system and its challenges but does not mention specific datasets.

I will then look into the **experiments section** where the authors describe the simulation setup and data collection. Here, they mention that wave data was collected from various locations, including:

1. **Albany, Western Australia**
2. **Garden Island, Western Australia**
3. **Armintza, Spain (Biscay Marine Energy Platform)**
4. **Wave Hub, Cornwall, United Kingdom**

The paper states that the wave generator model used in the simulation employs a well-established ocean wave spectrum like Jonswap, which is crucial for training and evaluation. However, it does not provide a specific dataset name or citation.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any of the cited works correspond to datasets. The references primarily consist of papers discussing methodologies and applications related to wave energy converters and reinforcement learning, but they do not explicitly list datasets.

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, I will summarize the information I have gathered:

- The paper discusses the use of wave data collected from various locations for training and evaluation of the reinforcement learning controller. However, it does not provide specific datasets or their citations.

In conclusion, while I have identified the sources of wave data mentioned in the paper, there are no formal datasets or citations provided. Therefore, I will note that the paper references wave data from specific geographic locations but lacks formal dataset citations. 

I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
