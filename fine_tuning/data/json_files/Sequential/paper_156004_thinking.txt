To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi model LSTM architecture for Track Association based on Automatic Identification System Data" by Md Asif Bin Syed & Imtiaz Ahmed, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS), which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of track association using AIS data. They mention that the AIS provides a large database of dynamic and geo-spatial information of marine vessels, which implies that the dataset is significant for their research.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the AIS dataset was procured from the National Automatic Identification System maintained by the Coast Guard department of a specific country. They also provide information about the structure of the dataset, which includes variables such as object ID, vessel ID, timestamp, latitude, longitude, speed, and course.

The authors specify that the dataset was formatted as a CSV file and comprised approximately 2700 data points with 540 vessel IDs selected for testing. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the AIS dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the AIS dataset itself, as it is a publicly available dataset maintained by the Coast Guard. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is derived from the National Automatic Identification System, but I will not be able to provide a formal citation as it is not explicitly listed in the references.

In summary, I will document the dataset as follows:

1. **AIS Dataset**: This dataset includes vessel observations collected via the Automatic Identification System, containing variables such as object ID, vessel ID, timestamp, latitude, longitude, speed, and course. It consists of approximately 2700 data points and is formatted as a CSV file.

Since the dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is maintained by the Coast Guard department of a specific country.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
