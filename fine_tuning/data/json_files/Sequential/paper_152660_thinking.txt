To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Seq2Seq Mimic Games: A Signaling Perspective" by Juan Leni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain detailed information about datasets. Therefore, I will focus more on the introduction and experiments sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the emergence of communication in multi-agent adversarial settings but do not mention specific datasets. I will need to look further into the **experiments section** for any datasets used in their studies.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors describe various experiments conducted to analyze the performance of their Seq2Seq models in different game settings. They mention that they ran an initial set of experiments but do not specify any datasets used for training or evaluation. This suggests that the experiments may have been conducted using simulated data generated by the models rather than established datasets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily focus on theoretical frameworks, algorithms, and previous works related to Seq2Seq models and signaling theory, rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide citations for them, I will conclude that there are no formal datasets referenced in this research. Instead, the authors seem to rely on their own experimental setups and simulations to conduct their analysis.

In summary, I will document that no specific datasets were extracted from this paper, as it primarily discusses theoretical models and experimental results without referencing established datasets. If any datasets were to be mentioned in future work or supplementary materials, I would need to revisit those sections to extract the relevant information and citations.
