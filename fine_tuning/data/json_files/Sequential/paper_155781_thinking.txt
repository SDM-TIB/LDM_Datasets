To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-driven Real-time Short-term Prediction of Air Quality: Comparison of ES, ARIMA, and LSTM" by Iryna Talamanova and Sabri Pllana, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of historical data for predicting air quality, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention using a dataset collected in Skopje for their experimental evaluation. This is a strong indication that there is a specific dataset that I need to identify.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe the dataset in more detail. They state that the dataset contains air pollution measurements from seven stations, including various pollutants such as CO, NO2, O3, PM10, and PM2.5. The focus of the study is on PM2.5, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

The authors reference the dataset with a citation number [16], which I will need to look up in the **References section** to obtain the full citation.

In the **References section**, I find the citation for the dataset:
- **Air pollution data collected in Skopje**: 
  > Petrushevski, S. (2018). *Air pollution in Skopje from 2008 to 2018*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/cokastefan/pm10-pollution-data-in-skopje-from-2008-to-2018

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Dataset Name**: Air pollution data collected in Skopje
   - **Description**: This dataset contains air pollution measurements from seven stations, including CO, NO2, O3, PM10, and PM2.5. The focus of the study is on PM2.5.
   - **Citation**: Petrushevski, S. (2018). *Air pollution in Skopje from 2008 to 2018*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/cokastefan/pm10-pollution-data-in-skopje-from-2008-to-2018

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
