To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Securing Social Spaces: Harnessing Deep Learning to Eradicate Cyberbullying" by Rohan Biswas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodologies, experiments, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the research focus but may not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the context of cyberbullying and the need for detection methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodologies section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention merging two datasets to create a desired dataset for their experiments. This is a crucial point, as it indicates that specific datasets are being utilized.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the dataset they used, including the structure and contents of the dataset files. They mention that the dataset contains labeled comments with attributes such as the time of the comment and the content, and they specify the files "train.csv" and "test_with_solutions.csv." This section is key for extracting the dataset information.

The authors state that the "train.csv" file contains 3947 tweets, with class labels indicating whether the tweets are Neutral or Insulting. The "test_with_solutions.csv" file contains 2647 tweets, which further confirms the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to a dataset sourced from Kaggle, specifically for detecting insults in social commentary. The citation for this dataset is:

- **Detecting Insults in Social Commentary**: 
  > Kaggle. n.d. Detecting Insults in Social Commentary. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/detecting-insults-in-socialcommentary/data (accessed 20 July 2023).

With this information, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Dataset Name**: Detecting Insults in Social Commentary
   - **Description**: This dataset contains labeled comments with attributes such as the time of the comment and the content. It includes two files: "train.csv" with 3947 tweets (1049 Insulting and 2898 Neutral) and "test_with_solutions.csv" with 2647 tweets (693 Insulting and 1954 Neutral).
   - **Citation**: Kaggle. n.d. Detecting Insults in Social Commentary. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/detecting-insults-in-socialcommentary/data (accessed 20 July 2023).

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
