To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Top-down Discourse Parsing via Sequence Labelling" by Fajri Koto, Jey Han Lau, and Timothy Baldwin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction typically outlines the context and may reference datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section often contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **English RST Discourse Treebank** for their experiments. This is a specific dataset that is crucial for understanding their methodology and results.

I will then look for a **Datasets section** or any mention of the dataset in the experiments section to gather more details about it. The authors describe the dataset as being based on the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank, consisting of 347 documents for training and 38 for testing. This information is essential for accurately describing the dataset.

After identifying the dataset, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the English RST Discourse Treebank. The citation is as follows:
> Lynn Carlson, Daniel Marcu, and Mary Ellen Okurowski. *Building a discourse-tagged corpus in the framework of rhetorical structure theory*. In SIGDIAL ’01 Proceedings of the Second SIGdial Workshop on Discourse and Dialogue - Volume 16, pages 1–10, 2001.

Now that I have the dataset name, description, and citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for context.
2. Focusing on the experiments section to identify the dataset.
3. Gathering details about the dataset's structure and purpose.
4. Retrieving the full citation from the references.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately extract and document the dataset used in the research paper.
