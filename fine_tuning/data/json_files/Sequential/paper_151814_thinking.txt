To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural Language Statistical Features of LSTM-generated Texts" by Marco Lippi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Corpora)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training the LSTM model and for authorship attribution experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Corpus of Novels by Charles Dickens**: This corpus consists of a collection of eighteen works by Charles Dickens, totaling over 24 million characters. This dataset is crucial as it serves as the training data for the LSTM model.

2. **Corpus for Authorship Attribution**: This smaller corpus includes texts from both Charles Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson, with 30 documents from each author, each consisting of 10,000 characters. This dataset is used to evaluate the authorship attribution capabilities of the generated texts.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from literary works that are publicly available, I will note the source of the Dickens corpus as Project Gutenberg, which is a well-known repository for literary texts.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- For the **Corpus of Novels by Charles Dickens**:
  > Project Gutenberg. *The Complete Works of Charles Dickens*. Available at: http://gutenberg.org

- For the **Corpus for Authorship Attribution**:
  > Project Gutenberg. *The Complete Works of Charles Dickens* and *The Works of Robert Louis Stevenson*. Available at: http://gutenberg.org

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
