To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero Initialization of Modified Gated Recurrent Encoder-Decoder Network for Short Term Load Forecasting" by Vedanshu and M M Tripathi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model was applied to short-term load forecasting using the load data of the Australian Energy Market, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Experiment Setup)**, specifically subsection A (Dataset used). Here, the authors explicitly mention that they used the **electricity load of New South Wales (NSW)** from the Australian Energy Market. They specify that the dataset includes historical electricity load data from the years 2015, 2016, and 2017, which is crucial information for describing the dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) as the source of the dataset. The citation for this dataset is:

> Australian Energy Market Operator. *Electricity Market Data*. Available at: https://aemo.com.au/Electricity/National-Electricity-Market-NEM/Data-dashboard#aggregated-data.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Electricity Load of New South Wales (NSW)**: This dataset contains historical electricity load data from the Australian Energy Market for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017. It includes total demands and their corresponding timestamps.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included.
