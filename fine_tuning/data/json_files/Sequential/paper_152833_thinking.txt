To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Non-Negative Kernel Sparse Coding for the Classification of Motion Data" by Babak Hosseini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In **section 3 (Datasets and Experiments)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets they utilized for their experiments. I will carefully note the names and descriptions of each dataset mentioned:

1. **CMU Motion Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the CMU graphics laboratory and consists of human motion capture data. The authors mention that it includes various types of human movements, segmented into classes.

2. **Cricket Umpire’s Signals**: This dataset contains samples of umpire signals related to cricket, with a total of 180 samples across 12 classes.

3. **Articulatory Words**: This dataset includes facial movement signals captured via EMA sensors, categorizing 25 classes of different words with a total of 575 samples.

4. **Squat Dataset**: Collected as part of a coaching project, this dataset consists of squat movements performed by coaches, segmented into three movement primitives, totaling 87 samples.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **CMU Motion Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Cricket Umpire’s Signals**, the citation is:
  > M. H. Ko, G. W. West, S. Venkatesh, and M. Kumar. *Online context recognition in multisensor systems using dynamic time warping*. In ISSNIP’05, pages 283–288. IEEE, 2005.

- For the **Articulatory Words**, the citation is:
  > Jun Wang, Ashok Samal, and Jordan Green. *Preliminary test of a real-time, interactive silent speech interface based on electromagnetic articulograph*. In SLPAT’14, pages 38–45, 2014.

- For the **Squat Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Thomas Waltemate, Felix Hülsmann, Thies Pfeiffer, Stefan Kopp, and Mario Botsch. *Realizing a low-latency virtual reality environment for motor learning*. In VRST’15, pages 139–147. ACM, 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
