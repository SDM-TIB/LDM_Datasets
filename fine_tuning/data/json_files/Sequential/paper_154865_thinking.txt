To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Clustering of Time Series Data with Prior Geographical Information" by Reza Asadi and Amelia Regan, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors used **traffic flow data obtained by PeMS** for their analysis, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **introduction** and **experimental results sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of spatio-temporal data in transportation systems, but they do not provide specific dataset names. However, in the **experimental results section**, they mention that the traffic flow data is gathered from **main-line loop detector sensors every 30 seconds and aggregated to every 5 minutes** for the US-101 South and I-280 South and I-680 South highways in the Bay Area of California.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PeMS dataset. The authors reference PeMS as follows:

- For the PeMS dataset, the citation is:
  > "California. PeMS, http://pems.dot.ca.gov/, 2017."

Since this is a web resource, I will note it as the source of the dataset.

Next, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **PeMS Traffic Flow Data**: This dataset includes traffic flow data collected from main-line loop detector sensors in the Bay Area of California. The data is recorded every 30 seconds and aggregated to every 5 minutes, covering multiple highways.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation for proper attribution. This will allow for easy reference and validation in future work or research.
