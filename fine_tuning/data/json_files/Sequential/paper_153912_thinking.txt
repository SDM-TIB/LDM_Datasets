To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "A CNN-LSTM Architecture for Detection of Intracranial Hemorrhage on CT scans" by Nhan T. Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their method on the **RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection challenge** and the **CQ500 dataset**, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will delve into the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the RSNA dataset, noting that it contains over 25,000 CT scans labeled with 5 specific subtypes of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). They also mention the CQ500 dataset, which consists of 500 studies that can be used for validation. This confirms that both datasets are relevant for extraction.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide further details about the datasets. The RSNA dataset is described as having between 20 to 60 slices per CT scan, and each slice is annotated with the ICH subtypes. The CQ500 dataset is mentioned as having between 16 to 128 slices per study, with similar annotations to the RSNA dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **RSNA dataset**, the citation is:
   > RSNA. Intracranial hemorrhage detection challenge. https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-intracranial-hemorrhage-detection/, 2019.

2. For the **CQ500 dataset**, the citation is:
   > M.R. Arbabshirani, B.K. Fornwalt, G.J. Mongelluzzo, J.D. Suever, B.D. Geise, A.A. Patel, and G.J. Moore. Advanced machine learning in action: Identification of intracranial hemorrhage on computed tomography scans of the head with clinical workflow integration. npj Digital Medicine, 1:1â€“7, 2018.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
