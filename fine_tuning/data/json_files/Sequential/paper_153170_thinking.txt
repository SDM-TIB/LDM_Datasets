To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Auto-encoding of Sentence Topics for Image Paragraph Generation" by Jing Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on the **Stanford image paragraph dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **Stanford image paragraph dataset** in detail, stating that it contains 19,551 images, each paired with one human-annotated paragraph. They also provide statistics about the average length of the paragraphs and the training, validation, and testing splits.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Stanford image paragraph dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the **Stanford image paragraph dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jonathan Krause, Justin Johnson, Ranjay Krishna, and Li Fei-Fei. *A hierarchical approach for generating descriptive image paragraphs*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, ready for any further processing or review.
