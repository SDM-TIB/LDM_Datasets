To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PolypNextLSTM: A lightweight and fast polyp video segmentation network using ConvNext and ConvLSTM" by Debayan Bhattacharya et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed model on the **SUN-SEG dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **Method section**, particularly **section 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the **SUN-SEG dataset**. They explain that this dataset is derived from the SUN database and includes meticulously crafted segmentation masks for each frame across 1,013 video clips, totaling 158,690 images. The dataset is divided into training and test sets, with specific details about the positive and negative cases.

In this section, the authors also describe the characteristics of the dataset, including the number of clips, frames, and the predefined test sets categorized as **SUN-SEG-Easy** and **SUN-SEG-Hard**. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's structure and its application in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **SUN-SEG dataset**. The relevant citation is:

> Ji, G.-P., Chou, Y.-C., Fan, D.-P., Chen, G., Fu, H., Jha, D., & Shao, L. (2021). Progressively normalized self-attention network for video polyp segmentation. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), pp. 142–152. Springer.

Since the SUN-SEG dataset is derived from the SUN database, I will also look for the original source of the SUN database. The citation for the SUN database is:

> Ma, Y., Chen, X., Cheng, K., Li, Y., & Sun, B. (2021). Ldpolypvideo benchmark: A large-scale colonoscopy video dataset of diverse polyps. In Proceedings of the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), pp. 387–396. Springer.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing. The key dataset extracted is the **SUN-SEG dataset**, and I will ensure to include the full citations for both the SUN-SEG dataset and the original SUN database in my final output.
