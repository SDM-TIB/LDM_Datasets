To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exact Indexing of Time Series under Dynamic Time Warping" by Zhengxin Li, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments conducted on real-world datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, there is a **Table 2** that lists various benchmark datasets used in the experiments, which is a crucial find. I will carefully note the details provided in this table.

The datasets listed in Table 2 include:

1. **ItalyPowerDemand**: This dataset has a length of 22–24 and an average length of 23, with 2 classes and 1096 samples.
2. **SyntheticControl**: This dataset has a length of 54–60 and an average length of 57, with 6 classes and 600 samples.
3. **ECG5000**: This dataset has a length of 126–140 and an average length of 133, with 5 classes and 5000 samples.
4. **GunPoint**: This dataset has a length of 135–150 and an average length of 143, with 2 classes and 200 samples.
5. **WordSynonyms**: This dataset has a length of 243–270 and an average length of 256, with 25 classes and 905 samples.
6. **Words50**: This dataset has a length of 243–270 and an average length of 257, with 50 classes and 905 samples.
7. **Symbols**: This dataset has a length of 359–398 and an average length of 379, with 6 classes and 1020 samples.
8. **Yoga**: This dataset has a length of 384–426 and an average length of 405, with 2 classes and 3300 samples.
9. **ShapesAll**: This dataset has a length of 461–512 and an average length of 486, with 60 classes and 1200 samples.
10. **Computers**: This dataset has a length of 648–720 and an average length of 683, with 2 classes and 500 samples.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide explicit citations for each dataset in the references. Instead, it mentions that the datasets come from the UCR time series repository.

To properly cite the datasets, I will use the following citation for the UCR time series repository:

> UCR Time Series Repository. Available at: http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data_2018/

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective details and the citation for the UCR repository. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
