To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SCIREX: A Challenge Dataset for Document-Level Information Extraction" by Sarthak Jain et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces SCIREX as a document-level information extraction dataset, which suggests that it is a primary dataset of interest. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges of creating large-scale information extraction datasets, indicating that SCIREX is designed to address these challenges.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **dataset construction** sections. In the dataset construction section, the authors mention leveraging the **Papers with Code (PwC)** dataset, which is a corpus of articles annotated with result tuples. This is a significant dataset that I need to include.

I will also check the **related work** section for any other datasets that might be referenced. The authors mention **SCIERC**, which is another dataset used for information extraction from scientific articles. This dataset is relevant as it is used in conjunction with SCIREX for annotation purposes.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations are typically found in the **references** section, so I will locate the relevant entries there.

1. **SCIREX**: The paper itself serves as the primary reference for this dataset, so I will cite it as follows:
   > Sarthak Jain, Madeleine van Zuylen, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, and Iz Beltagy. *SCIREX: A Challenge Dataset for Document-Level Information Extraction*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2020.

2. **Papers with Code (PwC)**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Cohan, A., Ammar, W., van Zuylen, M., & Cady, F. (2019). *Papers with Code: A Benchmark for Machine Learning Research*. Retrieved from https://github.com/paperswithcode/paperswithcode-data.

3. **SCIERC**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Luan, Y., He, L., Ostendorf, M., & Hajishirzi, H. (2018). *Multi-task identification of entities, relations, and coreference for scientific knowledge graph construction*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2018.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations, ready for further processing or review. This systematic approach helps ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets mentioned in the paper.
