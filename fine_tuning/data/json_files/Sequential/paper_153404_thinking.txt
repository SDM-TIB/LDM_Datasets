To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Decoupled Neural Architecture Search by Structure and Operation Sampling" by Heung-Chang Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets used in the study.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method achieves competitive performance on various benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using **CIFAR-10**, **ImageNet**, and **Penn Treebank** datasets for their experiments. I will note these datasets and look for more detailed descriptions.

In the **experiments section**, I will find specific details about each dataset, including the number of samples, the nature of the data, and any relevant preprocessing steps. The paper provides the following information:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, categorized into 10 classes.
2. **ImageNet**: This dataset contains approximately 1.2 million images across 1,000 classes, used for training.
3. **Penn Treebank**: This dataset is a standard benchmark for language modeling tasks, and the authors mention using the preprocessed version.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248–255, 2009.

- For **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, Mitchell P., Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313–330, 1993.

With this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
