To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RealSmileNet: A Deep End-To-End Network for Spontaneous and Posed Smile Recognition" by Yan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on four datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. In this section, they mention four datasets:

1. **UVA-NEMO Smile Database**: This dataset consists of 597 spontaneous and 643 posed smile videos, recorded at 1920×1080 pixels and 50 frames per second. The authors provide demographic details about the participants, which adds context to the dataset.

2. **BBC Database**: This dataset contains 20 videos, with 10 spontaneous and 10 posed smiles, recorded at a resolution of 314×286 pixels and 25 frames per second.

3. **MMI Facial Expression Database**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 138 spontaneous and 49 posed smile videos from various participants, with specific resolutions and frame rates for each type of smile.

4. **SPOS Database**: This dataset includes both gray and near-infrared sequences of images, with a resolution of 640×480 pixels and a frame rate of 25 frames per second.

After identifying these datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
