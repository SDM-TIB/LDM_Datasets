The purpose is to solve an Ubuntu user’s posted problem, i.e. select the correct next utterance based on the conversation so far between the two users. The training data contains over 100k complete conversations, and the test data contains 1000 partial conversations, where each dialog has a minimum of 3 turns. In addition to the dialog corpus, additional knowledge is also provided in the form of linux manual pages.",
