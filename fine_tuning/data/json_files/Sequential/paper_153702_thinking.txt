To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ImmuNetNAS: An Immune-network approach for searching Convolutional Neural Network Architectures" by Chen Kefan and Wei Pang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors achieved good performance on both the **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10 datasets**, indicating that these datasets are used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **section 4.1**, they mention that they tested their algorithm on the **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10 datasets**. They provide details about the configurations and training methods used for each dataset, confirming their involvement in the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The MNIST dataset is widely known, but I will ensure to provide a proper citation. The CIFAR-10 dataset is also well-documented, so I will look for its citation as well.

For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
> Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, Patrick Haffner, et al. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2010.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **MNIST Dataset** - A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset** - A dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or downstream processing.
