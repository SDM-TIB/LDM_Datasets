To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DialBERT: A Hierarchical Pre-Trained Model for Conversation Disentanglement" by Tianda Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving state-of-the-art results on a new dataset proposed by IBM (Kummerfeld et al., 2019). This indicates that there is at least one dataset that is crucial to their research.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experimental setup** sections, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly mention datasets. In section 4.1, the authors describe the dataset used for testing their model, which is a conversation disentanglement dataset published by Kummerfeld et al. (2019). They mention that this dataset contains 77,563 messages of IRC manually annotated with reply-to relations between messages.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The citation for the dataset is:

- For the dataset proposed by Kummerfeld et al. (2019), the citation is:
  > Jonathan K. Kummerfeld, Sai R. Gouravajhala, Joseph J. Peper, Vignesh Athreya, Chulaka Gunasekara, Jatin Ganhotra, Siva Sankalp Patel, Lazaros C Polymenakos, and Walter Lasecki. *A large-scale corpus for conversation disentanglement*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 3846â€“3856, Florence, Italy, 2019.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to using the **Ubuntu forum data** for post-training their model, which is derived from the DSTC8 competition. However, they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset in the references, as it is likely a well-known dataset in the community.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Conversation Disentanglement Dataset**: Contains 77,563 messages annotated with reply-to relations.
   - Citation: Kummerfeld et al. (2019).

2. **Ubuntu Forum Data**: Used for post-training, but no specific citation is provided.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the citations are accurate and complete.
