To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Automatic Meta Optimization Search for Few-Shot Learning" by Xinyue Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **Mini-ImageNet** and **Omniglot**, which suggests these are the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Few-shot Learning Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets:

1. **Mini-ImageNet**: The authors describe it as created by randomly sampling 100 classes from ImageNet, with a total of 600 examples per class. The training set consists of 38,400 images, the test set has 12,000 images, and the validation set contains 9,600 images.

2. **Omniglot**: This dataset consists of 1,623 characters from 50 different alphabets. The authors mention that they randomly select 1,200 characters for training and use the remaining characters for testing. They also note that the dataset was augmented with rotations by multiples of 90 degrees.

To confirm the citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference the original sources for both datasets:

- For **Mini-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T.P. (2016). *Matching networks for one shot learning*. CoRR abs/1606.04080. Retrieved from http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04080.

- For **Omniglot**, the citation is:
  > Lake, B.M., Salakhutdinov, R., Tenenbaum, J.B. (2015). *Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction*. Science, 350(6266), 1332â€“1338.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
