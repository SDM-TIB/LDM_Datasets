To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TEA-PSE 3.0: Tencent-Ethereal-Audio-Lab Personalized Speech Enhancement System for ICASSP 2023 DNS-Challenge" by Yukai Ju et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work but does not specify datasets. The introduction references previous work but does not detail datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. They state: "We use the ICASSP 2022 DNS-challenge full-band dataset for experiments." This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized.

In this section, they also mention the sources of the noise data, which include **DEMAND, Freesound, and AudioSet**. However, I need to confirm if these sources are considered datasets in their own right or if they are simply components of the main dataset.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ICASSP 2022 DNS-challenge dataset. The relevant reference is:

- For the **ICASSP 2022 DNS-challenge full-band dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Dubey, V. Gopal, R. Cutler, A. Aazami, S. Matusevych, S. Braun, S. E. Eskimez, M. Thakker, T. Yoshioka, H. Gamper, et al., “ICASSP 2022 deep noise suppression challenge,” in ICASSP. IEEE, 2022, pp. 9271–9275.

Now, I will create an entry for the dataset using the required format, ensuring to include the full citation for the ICASSP 2022 DNS-challenge dataset.

After compiling this information, I will be ready to present the dataset entry in the specified structured format for further processing or review.
