To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Mini-Batch Training with Varying Length Time Series" by Brian Kenji Iwana, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used **11 datasets from the 2018 UCR Time Series Archive**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the paper lists the datasets used in the experiments. The datasets are summarized in Table 1, which provides their names, types, and length statistics. This section is essential for identifying the datasets and understanding their characteristics.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **AllGestureWiimoteX**
2. **AllGestureWiimoteY**
3. **AllGestureWiimoteZ**
4. **GestureMidAirD1**
5. **GestureMidAirD2**
6. **GestureMidAirD3**
7. **GesturePebbleZ1**
8. **GesturePebbleZ2**
9. **PickupGestureWiiZ**
10. **PLAID**
11. **ShakeGestureWiiZ**

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The paper references the **UCR Time Series Archive** as the source for these datasets, which is crucial for proper citation.

The citation for the UCR Time Series Archive is:
> Hoang Anh Dau, Eamonn Keogh, Kaveh Kamgar, Chin-Chia Michael Yeh, Yan Zhu, Shaghayegh Gharghabi, Chotirat Ann Ratanamahatana, Yanping, Bing Hu, Nurjahan Begum, Anthony Bagnall, Abdullah Mueen, Gustavo Batista, and Hexagon-ML. *The UCR Time Series Classification Archive*. 2018. Available at: https://www.cs.ucr.edu/eamonn/time_series_data_2018/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their source, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset names and the full citation for the UCR Time Series Archive.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
