To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling and Predicting Blood Flow Characteristics Through Double Stenosed Artery from CFD Simulation Using Deep Learning Models" by Ishat Raihan Jamil and Mayeesha Humaira, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a dataset generated by CFD simulations of double stenosed artery models, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset they constructed. They mention that a custom dataset containing **180 data points** was created, detailing the configurations of lumen openings, gaps between stenoses, and inlet velocities. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's structure and purpose.

The authors also mention that **90% of the total data** was used for training, while the remaining **10% was used for validation**, and they constructed a separate test set containing **18 data points** with different configurations. This information is essential for understanding how the dataset was utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works referenced in the paper. However, since the dataset is custom and not publicly available, I will note that it does not have a formal citation like established datasets.

The key points to extract regarding the dataset are:
1. **Custom Dataset**: Contains 180 data points generated from CFD simulations.
2. **Training/Validation Split**: 90% for training, 10% for validation.
3. **Test Set**: A separate test set of 18 data points with different configurations.

Since the dataset is custom and not published elsewhere, I will not be able to provide a formal citation for it. Instead, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Custom CFD Simulation Dataset for Double Stenosed Artery
- **Description**: A dataset containing 180 data points generated from CFD simulations of double stenosed artery models, with various configurations of lumen openings and inlet velocities.
- **Usage**: 90% for training, 10% for validation, and a separate test set of 18 data points.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that the details about the dataset are accurately captured.
