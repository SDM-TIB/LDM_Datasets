To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rocket Landing Control with Random Annealing Jump Start" by Yuxuan Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the application of reinforcement learning (RL) for rocket landing control, but it does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. I will look for any references to simulation environments, benchmarks, or datasets used for training or testing the proposed method. If the authors mention any specific datasets or simulation environments, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

In this paper, the authors describe the use of a **high-fidelity rocket model built in Simulink** for their experiments. However, they do not mention any publicly available datasets or benchmarks that are typically used in reinforcement learning research. Instead, they focus on the simulation environment they created for their specific task.

Since no external datasets are referenced, I will check the **references section** to see if any foundational datasets or models are cited that could be relevant to the research. However, it appears that the focus is primarily on the developed model and the methodology rather than on existing datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, I conclude that there are no specific datasets mentioned that can be cited. The authors primarily rely on their own simulation environment and model for the experiments.

In summary, while I have thoroughly searched the paper for datasets, it seems that the authors did not utilize any external datasets for their research. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none were identified in the paper.
