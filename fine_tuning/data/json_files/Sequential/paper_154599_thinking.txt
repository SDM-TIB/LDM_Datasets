To extract datasets from the research paper titled "S3M: Siamese Stack (Trace) Similarity Measure" by Aleksandr Khvorov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on both an open-sourced dataset and a private JetBrains dataset, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors detail their methodology. They mention using two datasets: the **JetBrains dataset** and the **NetBeans dataset**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics, sizes, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In **Table I**, the authors provide detailed information about the datasets, including the number of reports and the dates of the datasets. The JetBrains dataset consists of 299,444 reports with a training set of 8,769 reports, while the NetBeans dataset has 39,789 reports with a training set of 31,349 reports. This information is essential for understanding the datasets' scope and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the NetBeans dataset is available on Figshare, and the implementation of their approach is available on GitHub. I will note these sources as they provide the necessary citations for the datasets.

The full citations I will compile are:

- For the **JetBrains dataset**, since it is a private dataset, there may not be a formal citation, but I will note its significance as a dataset created from stack traces of JetBrains products.

- For the **NetBeans dataset**, the citation is:
  > NetBeans Stack Traces Dataset. Available at: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/netbeans_stacktraces_json/14135003.

Finally, I will summarize the findings for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
