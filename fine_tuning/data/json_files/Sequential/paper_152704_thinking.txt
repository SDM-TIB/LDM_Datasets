To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Multimodal LSTM for Predicting Listener Empathic Responses Over Time" by Zhi-Xuan Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset from the OMG-Empathy Prediction Challenge, which indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized for the research. This is a good starting point for identifying the dataset.

Next, I will look into the **Methods section**, particularly the subsection labeled **Dataset**. Here, the authors provide a detailed description of the OMG-Empathy Dataset, including its structure and the nature of the interactions it captures. They explain that the dataset consists of semi-scripted interactions between actors and listeners, detailing the number of videos and how they are split into training, validation, and test sets.

In this section, I will note the key details about the dataset:
- The dataset includes 80 videos of interactions, with specific splits for training (40 videos), validation (10 videos), and testing (30 videos).
- The emotional responses of listeners are annotated continuously, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's application in the study.

After gathering this information, I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OMG-Empathy Dataset. The paper does not provide a direct citation for the dataset itself, but it references the OMG-Empathy Prediction Challenge, which is likely where the dataset originated. 

I will look for any related papers or proceedings that might provide the necessary citation. In this case, the dataset is associated with the challenge held in conjunction with IEEE FG 2019, so I will cite the challenge as follows:

- For the **OMG-Empathy Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhi-Xuan Tan, Arushi Goel, Thanh-Son Nguyen, and Desmond C. Ong. *A Multimodal LSTM for Predicting Listener Empathic Responses Over Time*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG), 2019.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes ensuring that the dataset name, description, and citation are clearly articulated for any future reference or processing.
