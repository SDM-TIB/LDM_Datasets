To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Unsupervised Semantic Role Labeling" by Kashif Munir et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the experiments were conducted on the **CoNLL-2009 English dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is relevant to the research.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for more details about the dataset. In section 4, the authors mention that they tested their model on the **CoNLL-2009 English dataset**, which provides gold annotations in PropBank style. This confirms that the CoNLL-2009 dataset is indeed used for their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets that might be referenced in the **related work** or **methodology sections**. However, the paper primarily focuses on the CoNLL-2009 dataset for its experiments, and no other datasets are explicitly mentioned.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citation for the CoNLL-2009 dataset. The citation for the CoNLL-2009 dataset is as follows:
> Martha Palmer, Daniel Gildea, and Paul Kingsbury. *The Proposition Bank: An Annotated Corpus of Semantic Roles*. Computational Linguistics, 31(1):71â€“106, 2005.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extraction:

1. **CoNLL-2009 English dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed unsupervised semantic role labeling model. It provides gold annotations in PropBank style, which are essential for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
