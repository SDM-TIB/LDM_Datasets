To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ResNeSt: Split-Attention Networks" by Hang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the ResNeSt model achieves superior transfer learning results on several public benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments on various tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these contexts.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **ImageNet Dataset**: This dataset is used for image classification tasks. It consists of 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 different classes.

2. **MS-COCO Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for object detection and instance segmentation tasks. The authors mention training on the COCO-2017 training set, which contains 118,000 images, and evaluating on the COCO-2017 validation set with 5,000 images.

3. **Cityscapes Dataset**: This dataset is used for semantic segmentation tasks. It consists of 5,000 high-quality labeled images, with 2,975 images from the training set and 500 validation images.

4. **ADE20K Dataset**: Another dataset mentioned for semantic segmentation, containing 20,000 training images, 2,000 validation images, and 3,000 test images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet Dataset**, the citation is:

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
