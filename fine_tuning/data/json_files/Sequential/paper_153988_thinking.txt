To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-lingual Retrieval for Iterative Self-Supervised Training" by Chau Tran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract highlights the use of a method called CRISS, which improves cross-lingual alignment and translation ability, suggesting that datasets are involved in the evaluation of this method.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using the **TED58 dataset** for sentence retrieval tasks, which contains multi-way translations of TED talks in 58 languages. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results or discussion sections**. The authors reference the **Flores dataset** for low-resource machine translation tasks, specifically for Nepali-English and Sinhala-English translations. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their method in low-resource settings.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for the identified datasets:

1. **TED58 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Ye Qi, Devendra Sachan, Matthieu Felix, Sarguna Padmanabhan, and Graham Neubig. *When and why are pre-trained word embeddings useful for neural machine translation?* In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 2 (Short Papers), pages 529–535, 2018.

2. **Flores Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Francisco Guzmán, Peng-Jen Chen, Myle Ott, Juan Pino, Guillaume Lample, Philipp Koehn, Vishrav Chaudhary, and Marc’Aurelio Ranzato. *The Flores evaluation datasets for low-resource machine translation: Nepali–English and Sinhala–English*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 6100–6113, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
