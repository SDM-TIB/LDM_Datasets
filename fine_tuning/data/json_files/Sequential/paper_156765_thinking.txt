To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COVID-19 Twitter Sentiment Classification Using Hybrid Deep Learning Model Based on Grid Search Methodology" by Jitendra V. Tembhurne et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a "Twitter COVID-19 dataset," which suggests that there is a specific dataset used for sentiment analysis.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Material and Methods)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention three distinct datasets based on tweets collected during different time frames:

1. **Dataset A**: This dataset includes 143,902 tweets collected from April to June 2020.
2. **Dataset B**: This dataset contains 120,508 tweets collected from August to October 2020.
3. **Dataset C**: This dataset comprises 147,474 tweets collected from April to June 2021.

The authors provide a breakdown of the sentiment distribution (positive, negative, neutral) for each dataset, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is publicly available and mentioned in the paper, the authors do not provide a separate citation for it. Instead, they refer to it as the "Twitter COVID-19 dataset."

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their usage in the study.

The final dataset entries will be as follows:

- **Twitter COVID-19 Dataset A**: 143,902 tweets from April to June 2020.
- **Twitter COVID-19 Dataset B**: 120,508 tweets from August to October 2020.
- **Twitter COVID-19 Dataset C**: 147,474 tweets from April to June 2021.

Since the dataset is not attributed to a specific author or publication, I will note that it is publicly available as mentioned in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
