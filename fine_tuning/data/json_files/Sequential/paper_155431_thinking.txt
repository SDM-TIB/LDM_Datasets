To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scaling Language Model Size in Cross-Device Federated Learning" by Jae Hun Ro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a "Stack Overflow federated dataset," which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset and models)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for training. Here, they specify that they trained on the **Stack Overflow federated dataset from TFF (TensorFlow Federated)**, which contains posts from the public forum grouped by username. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's purpose and structure.

Additionally, the authors mention using two datasets for pretraining: a large corpus of digitized books and the **One Billion Word Benchmark (LM1B)**. I will need to extract details about both of these datasets as well.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Stack Overflow federated dataset**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, but it references TensorFlow Federated (TFF) as the source. I will note that it is from TFF (2018) and provide the URL for TensorFlow Federated.
   > TensorFlow Federated. *TensorFlow Federated*. 2018. URL: https://www.tensorflow.org/federated.

2. **One Billion Word Benchmark (LM1B)**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Chelba, C., Mikolov, T., Schuster, M., Ge, Q., Brants, T., Koehn, P. T., & Robinson, T. (2014). *One billion word benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling*. ArXiv: abs/1312.3005.

3. **Digitized Books Dataset**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset either. I will note that it is referenced in the context of pretraining but lacks a formal citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets that have them, and note any datasets that do not have formal citations.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any downstream processing or review.
