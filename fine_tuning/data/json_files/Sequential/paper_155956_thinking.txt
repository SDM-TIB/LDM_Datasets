To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparative study of Transformer and LSTM Network with attention mechanism on Image Captioning" by Pranav Dandwate et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses the **MS-COCO dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for image captioning. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will examine the **Datasets section** (section 4) of the paper, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I find that the authors mention several datasets:

1. **MS-COCO Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing approximately 132,000 images, each annotated with five captions. It is a standard benchmark for image captioning tasks.

2. **Flickr8K Dataset**: This dataset consists of 8,000 images, each with five captions. It is another commonly used dataset for image captioning.

3. **Flickr30K Dataset**: This dataset includes 30,000 images, also with five captions per image. It is similar to Flickr8K but larger in scale.

The authors also mention that they used the **MS-COCO-14 dataset**, which is a specific version of the MS-COCO dataset that includes around 86,000 training images and 40,000 validation images. This detail is important for accurately citing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MS-COCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, Lubomir Bourdev, Ross Girshick, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, C. Lawrence Zitnick, Piotr Dollár. "Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context." In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For the **Flickr8K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Peter Young, Alice Lai, Micah Hodosh, and Julia Hockenmaier. "From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions." Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2:67–78, 2014.

- For the **Flickr30K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Young, P., Lai, A., Hodosh, M., & Hockenmaier, J. (2014). "From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions." Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2, 67-78.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **MS-COCO Dataset**: A large-scale dataset for image captioning with 132,000 images and five captions per image.
2. **Flickr8K Dataset**: A dataset containing 8,000 images, each annotated with five captions.
3. **Flickr30K Dataset**: A dataset with 30,000 images, also annotated with five captions.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
