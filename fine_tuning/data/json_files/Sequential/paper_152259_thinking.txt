To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Google’s Neural Machine Translation System: Bridging the Gap between Human and Machine Translation" by Yonghui Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but the introduction often contains more specific references to datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and mention that their system was evaluated on the **WMT’14 English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **WMT’14 English-to-French Dataset**: This dataset contains 36 million sentence pairs used for training and is a standard benchmark for evaluating translation systems.

2. **WMT’14 English-to-German Dataset**: This dataset contains 5 million sentence pairs and is also widely used for benchmarking translation systems.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for these datasets are typically found in the context of previous works that introduced or utilized them.

For the **WMT’14 English-to-French dataset**, the citation is:
> Bojar, O., et al. *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, 2014.

For the **WMT’14 English-to-German dataset**, the citation is the same as above, as both datasets are part of the same workshop.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately extracted the datasets and their full citations, which are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or application of this research.
