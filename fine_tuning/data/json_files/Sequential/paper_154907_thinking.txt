To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Signal Detection Scheme Based on Deep Learning in OFDM Systems" by Guangliang Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the development of a deep learning approach for signal detection in OFDM systems, but it does not mention specific datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this section, the authors mention that they conducted simulations to evaluate their proposed method. They refer to "simulation data obtained through OFDM system and wireless channel modeling," but they do not provide specific names or citations for any datasets.

I will also look for any references to datasets in the **conclusion** and **acknowledgment sections**. The conclusion summarizes the findings but does not introduce any new datasets. The acknowledgment section mentions funding sources but does not provide information about datasets.

Since the paper primarily discusses simulation data generated by the authors rather than publicly available datasets, I will note that there are no specific datasets cited in the paper. However, the authors do reference the **3GPP TR38.901 channel model** as a wireless channel model used in their simulations. This model is relevant for understanding the context of their experiments but does not constitute a dataset in the traditional sense.

Finally, I will compile the findings. Since no datasets were explicitly named or cited in the paper, I will document that there are no datasets to report, but I will include the reference to the 3GPP TR38.901 channel model for completeness.

In summary, I will prepare a structured output indicating that no specific datasets were extracted from the paper, but I will mention the relevant channel model used in the simulations.
