To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structural Language Models of Code" by Uri Alon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on specific benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **Java-small dataset**: This dataset is a re-split of the dataset from Allamanis et al. (2016) and contains 11 GitHub projects, with a total of 1.3 million training examples. The authors provide details about how the dataset was constructed and filtered.

2. **C# dataset**: This dataset is derived from the raw dataset of Allamanis et al. (2018) and contains 30 GitHub projects, with specific filtering criteria applied to ensure the examples are suitable for the restricted completion task.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Java-small dataset**, the citation is:
  > Allamanis, M., Peng, H., and Sutton, C. A convolutional attention network for extreme summarization of source code. In International conference on machine learning, pp. 2091â€“2100, 2016.

- For the **C# dataset**, the citation is:
  > Allamanis, M., Brockschmidt, M., and Khademi, M. Learning to represent programs with graphs. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
