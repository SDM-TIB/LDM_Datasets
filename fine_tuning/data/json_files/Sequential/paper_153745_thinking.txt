To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FTT-NAS: Discovering Fault-Tolerant Convolutional Neural Architecture" by Xuefei Ning et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their characteristics or usage.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is a well-known benchmark in the field of computer vision, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The citation for CIFAR-10 is as follows:
> Alex Krizhevsky. 2009. Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. (2009).

Since CIFAR-10 is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset name, its description, and the full citation, ready for any further processing or review.
