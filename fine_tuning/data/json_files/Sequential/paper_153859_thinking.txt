To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context Based Text-Generation Using LSTM Networks" by Sivasurya Santhanam, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is trained on a dataset of choice, which suggests that a specific dataset is used, but I need to find the exact name and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Context based text generation)**, where the author states that a section of **The Lord of the Rings dataset** is used for data pre-processing. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized. I will look for any additional details about this dataset, such as how it was processed or any specific characteristics mentioned.

In **section 5 (Methodology)**, the author describes the data pre-processing steps, including the removal of punctuation and the selection of sentences with a minimum length. This section confirms that the dataset is indeed **The Lord of the Rings dataset**, and it provides context on how the dataset was prepared for training.

I will also check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is a well-known literary work, it may not have a formal citation like other datasets. Instead, I will note that it is a publicly available text.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset where applicable. For **The Lord of the Rings dataset**, I will provide a general citation for the book:

- **The Lord of the Rings**: 
  > J.R.R. Tolkien. *The Lord of the Rings*. George Allen & Unwin, 1954-1955.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset entry, ensuring that it is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
