To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Blending Diverse Physical Priors with Neural Networks" by Yunhao Ba, Guangyuan Zhao, and Achuta Kadambi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used. The experiments section typically details the datasets employed in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for a general architecture that can adapt to variations in the correctness of physics and the quality of training data. This suggests that they likely used specific datasets to evaluate their proposed method, PhysicsNAS.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In **section 4.1**, the authors describe two specific tasks: the **TOSSING TRAJECTORY PREDICTION** task and the **COLLISION SPEED ESTIMATION** task. They provide details about the input data for these tasks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

For the **TOSSING TRAJECTORY PREDICTION task**, the authors mention that the initial three locations of the object are given as input, and they describe the physical equations used to predict future locations. However, they do not explicitly name a dataset here.

For the **COLLISION SPEED ESTIMATION task**, the authors specify that the input includes the speed of two objects, their masses, and the distance between them. Again, no specific dataset is named.

After reviewing these sections, I will check the **References section** for any datasets that may have been cited. The authors reference various works related to physics-based learning and neural networks, but they do not explicitly mention datasets in the context of their experiments.

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **TOSSING TRAJECTORY PREDICTION**: The task involves predicting the trajectory of a tossed object based on physical equations. No specific dataset is cited.
2. **COLLISION SPEED ESTIMATION**: The task involves estimating the speed of two colliding objects based on their initial conditions. No specific dataset is cited.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses tasks that involve datasets, it does not provide explicit names or citations for any datasets used in the experiments. Therefore, I will note that no datasets were identified with full citations in this paper.

Now, I will compile the findings into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
