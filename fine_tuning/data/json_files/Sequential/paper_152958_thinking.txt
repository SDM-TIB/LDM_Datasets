To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Syntax-Enhanced Neural Machine Translation with Syntax-Aware Word Representations" by Meishan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets for Chinese-English and English-Vietnamese translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** (section 4). In section 4.1, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Chinese-English Translation Dataset**: The authors mention using parallel training data from publicly available LDC corpora, which consists of 1.25 million sentence pairs with 28.3 million Chinese words and 34.5 million English words. They also specify the test datasets as NIST MT02, MT03, MT04, MT05, and MT06.

2. **IWSLT 2015 Dataset**: For the English-Vietnamese translation task, they refer to the standard IWSLT 2015 dataset, which contains about 133,000 sentence pairs, with TED tst2012 and tst2013 as the development and test datasets.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. However, the datasets themselves may not have formal citations like traditional publications. Instead, I will note the sources as described in the paper:

- For the **Chinese-English Translation Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LDC2002E18, LDC2003E07, LDC2003E14, and portions of LDC2004T07, LDC2004T08, and LDC2005T06.

- For the **IWSLT 2015 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > IWSLT 2015, available at https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/nmt/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their sources, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Chinese-English Translation Dataset**: 
   - Description: Parallel training data from LDC corpora with 1.25 million sentence pairs.
   - Citation: LDC2002E18, LDC2003E07, LDC2003E14, portions of LDC2004T07, LDC2004T08, and LDC2005T06.

2. **IWSLT 2015 Dataset**: 
   - Description: Contains about 133,000 sentence pairs for English-Vietnamese translation.
   - Citation: IWSLT 2015, available at https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/nmt/.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that the citations are complete and accurate for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
