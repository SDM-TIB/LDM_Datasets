To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Theoretically Grounded Application of Dropout in Recurrent Neural Networks" by Yarin Gal and Zoubin Ghahramani, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the application of dropout in LSTM and GRU models and references the **Penn Treebank** dataset, which is a well-known benchmark for language modeling tasks. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5 (Experimental Evaluation), the authors explicitly state that they replicate the language modeling experiment using the **Penn Treebank** dataset. They also mention using the **Cornell film reviews corpus** for sentiment analysis in section 5.2. This confirms that there are two datasets to document.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **Penn Treebank**: The citation is not explicitly provided in the text, but it is a well-known dataset in the field. The standard citation is:
   > Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

2. **Cornell Film Reviews Corpus**: The citation is provided in the text:
   > Pang, B., & Lee, L. (2005). Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales. In *Proceedings of the ACL*. ACL.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Penn Treebank**: A dataset used for language modeling, consisting of 887,521 tokens (words) in total. It is a standard benchmark in the field, making it crucial for evaluating language models.

2. **Cornell Film Reviews Corpus**: A dataset composed of 5,000 film reviews, used for sentiment analysis tasks. The reviews are extracted into segments for analysis.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
