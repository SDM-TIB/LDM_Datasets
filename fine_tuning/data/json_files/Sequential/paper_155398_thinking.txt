To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Anticipate Future with Dynamic Context Removal" by Xinyu Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method achieves state-of-the-art results on four widely-used benchmarks. This indicates that there are datasets involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look specifically at **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **EPIC-KITCHENS-100 (EK100)**: This dataset consists of 700 long videos of 100 hours of egocentric cooking activity, with a total of 89,977 action segments. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Dima Damen, Hazel Doughty, Giovanni Maria Farinella, Antonino Furnari, Evangelos Kazakos, Davide Moltisanti, Jonathan Munro, Toby Perrett, Will Price, and Michael Wray. *Rescaling egocentric vision: Collection, pipeline and challenges for epic-kitchens-100*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2021.

2. **EPIC-KITCHENS-55 (EK55)**: This is a subset of EK100, containing 432 videos and 39,596 action segments. The citation is:
   > Dima Damen, Hazel Doughty, Giovanni Maria Farinella, Sanja Fidler, Antonino Furnari, Evangelos Kazakos, Davide Moltisanti, Jonathan Munro, Toby Perrett, Will Price, et al. *Scaling egocentric vision: The epic-kitchens dataset*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 720–736, 2018.

3. **EGTEA GAZE+ (EG+)**: This dataset includes 10,325 segments in 86 videos, annotated with action labels. The citation is:
   > Yin Li, Miao Liu, and James M. Rehg. *In the eye of beholder: Joint learning of gaze and actions in first person video*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), September 2018.

4. **50-Salads (50S)**: This dataset consists of nearly 0.9K action segments related to salad preparation. The citation is:
   > Sebastian Stein and Stephen J McKenna. *Combining embedded accelerometers with computer vision for recognizing food preparation activities*. In Proceedings of the 2013 ACM international joint conference on Pervasive and ubiquitous computing, pages 729–738, 2013.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their descriptions and citations accurately. I will also check the **References section** to confirm the citations are complete and correctly formatted.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will facilitate any further analysis or processing of the datasets mentioned in the paper.
