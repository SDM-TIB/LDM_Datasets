To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Summarization Programs: Interpretable Abstractive Summarization with Neural Modular Trees" by Swarnadeep Saha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a framework for summarization but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction may provide insights into the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention that they conducted experiments on two English single-document summarization datasets: **CNN/DailyMail** and **XSum**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their research.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. Advances in neural information processing systems, 28, 2015. URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03340.

2. **XSum Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Shashi Narayan, Shay B Cohen, and Mirella Lapata. *Don’t give me the details, just the summary! Topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 1797–1807, 2018. URL: https://aclanthology.org/D18-1206.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
