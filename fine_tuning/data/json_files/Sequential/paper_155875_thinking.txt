To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Day-Ahead PV Power Forecasting Based on MSTL-TFT" by Xuetao Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses the **Desert Knowledge Australia Solar Centre (DKASC)** dataset for day-ahead PV prediction, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **data preparation section**. Here, the authors describe the DKASC dataset in detail, including its location, characteristics, and the time period of the data collection. They mention that the data was collected from 2018 to 2020 and includes power generation data from 13 PV plants, along with various meteorological features.

In the **data preparation section**, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including the parameters of the PV plants and the types of data collected. This section confirms that the DKASC dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DKASC dataset. The authors mention that the DKASC is the largest PV power station in the Southern Hemisphere and provide a URL for more information. The citation for the DKASC dataset is as follows:

- **Desert Knowledge Australia Solar Centre (DKASC)**:
  > DKASC details. 2008. URL: https://dkasolarcentre.com.au/locations/alice-springs.

Since the DKASC dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete with the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
