To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scope-enhanced Compositional Semantic Parsing for DRT" by Xiulin Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the **Parallel Meaning Bank (PMB)** as a key resource for their experiments. This indicates that PMB is likely a dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors specifically mention using the **PMB release 5.1.0** for evaluation, which includes various splits (Gold, Silver, Bronze) based on the quality of annotation. This is crucial information that I need to capture.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PMB dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Lasha Abzianidze, Johannes Bjerva, Kilian Evang, Hessel Haagsma, Rik van Noord, Pierre Ludmann, Duc-Duy Nguyen, and Johan Bos. 2017. The Parallel Meaning Bank: Towards a multilingual corpus of translations annotated with compositional meaning representations. In Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Volume 2, Short Papers, pages 242â€“247, Valencia, Spain. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Parallel Meaning Bank (PMB)**: This dataset is a multilingual parallel corpus used for semantic parsing, specifically for Discourse Representation Theory (DRT). The paper mentions using the latest version (PMB release 5.1.0, English) for evaluation, focusing on the Gold-annotated data.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured accurately.
