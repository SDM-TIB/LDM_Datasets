To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Chinese Word Segmentation with Contextualized Word Representations" by Yung-Sung Chuang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on many datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the author discusses the datasets used for the experiments. Here, the author mentions two specific datasets:

1. **SIGHAN 2005 Bake-off Task**: This dataset is referenced in the context of evaluating the performance of the proposed model. The author cites the original source of this dataset as Emerson (2005).

2. **Chinese Universal Treebank (UD)**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the Conll2017 shared task, with a citation to Zeman et al. (2017).

In **Table 3**, the author provides statistics for each dataset, confirming their use in the experiments. This reinforces that these two datasets are indeed the ones utilized for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SIGHAN 2005 Bake-off Task**, the citation is:
  > Emerson, T. (2005). *The SIGHAN 2005 Bake-off: Word Segmentation and Named Entity Recognition for Chinese*. In Proceedings of the SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing.

- For the **Chinese Universal Treebank (UD)**, the citation is:
  > Zeman, D., Popel, M., Straka, M., Hajic, J., Nivre, J., Ginter, F., et al. (2017). *CoNLL 2017 Shared Task: Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies*. In Proceedings of the CoNLL 2017 Shared Task.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and reference.
