To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural CRF Model for Sentence Alignment in Text Simplification" by Chao Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the authors created two manually annotated sentence-aligned datasets from two commonly used text simplification corpora, namely **Newsela** and **Wikipedia**. This suggests that these datasets are significant for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the datasets in the **methodology** and **results** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention the creation of two new datasets: **NEWSELA-AUTO** and **WIKI-AUTO**, which are automatically constructed from the original Newsela and Wikipedia datasets. This is a crucial point as it highlights the datasets that are central to their experiments.

In the **datasets section**, the authors provide detailed statistics about the datasets they created. They mention:

1. **NEWSELA-MANUAL**: This dataset consists of 50 article sets with manually annotated sentence alignments. It is derived from the Newsela corpus, which contains 1,932 articles.

2. **WIKI-MANUAL**: This dataset includes 500 article pairs with manually annotated sentence alignments from the English Wikipedia and Simple English Wikipedia.

3. **NEWSELA-AUTO**: This dataset contains 666,645 sentence pairs that were automatically aligned using their proposed model.

4. **WIKI-AUTO**: This dataset consists of 604,000 non-identical aligned and partially-aligned sentence pairs extracted from the Wikipedia corpus.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the original datasets are as follows:

- For **Newsela**, the citation is:
  > Wei Xu, Chris Callison-Burch, and Courtney Napoles. *Problems in current text simplification research: New data can help*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2015.

- For **Wikipedia**, the citation is:
  > Zhemin Zhu, Delphine Bernhard, and Iryna Gurevych. *A monolingual tree-based translation model for sentence simplification*. In Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics, 2010.

- For **WIKILARGE**, which is referenced in the context of the WIKI-AUTO dataset, the citation is:
  > Xingxing Zhang and Mirella Lapata. *Sentence simplification with deep reinforcement learning*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
