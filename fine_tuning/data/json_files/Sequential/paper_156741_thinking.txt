To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NEUROASSIST: ENHANCING COGNITIVE-COMPUTER SYNERGY WITH ADAPTIVE AI AND ADVANCED NEURAL DECODING FOR EFFICIENT EEG SIGNAL CLASSIFICATION" by Eeshan G. Dandamudi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the experimental analysis was conducted on the **GigaScience** and **BCI-competition-IV-2a datasets**, which suggests that these are the primary datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **methodology section**. In **section 3.1**, the author provides specific information about the datasets:

1. **GigaScience Dataset**: This dataset is described as a multimodal dataset designed for BCI research, containing EEG recordings from 25 healthy subjects across multiple sessions, totaling 82,500 trials. The EEG data were collected using a 60-channel setup based on the 10â€“20 position system.

2. **BCI-IV2a Dataset**: This dataset is used to validate the NeuroAssist approach and consists of EEG data from nine individuals visualizing four body parts for motor imagery tasks. It includes 5,184 trials in total.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used for the experiments, which is supported by the findings presented.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

- For the **GigaScience dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nemati, M., et al. (2022). *GigaScience dataset for brain-computer interface research focusing on upper-extremity movements*. GigaScience.

- For the **BCI-IV2a dataset**, the citation is:
  > Altuwaijri, A., & Muhammad, G. (2022). *Electroencephalogram-based motor imagery signals classification using a multi-branch convolutional neural network model with attention blocks*. Bioengineering, 9(7), 323.

After compiling this information, I will prepare the dataset entries according to the required format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
