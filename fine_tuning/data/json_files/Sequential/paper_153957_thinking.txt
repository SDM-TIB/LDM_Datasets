To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Open-Narrow-Synechiae Anterior Chamber Angle Classification in AS-OCT Sequences" by Huaying Hao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated across two AS-OCT datasets, which suggests that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. They mention a **private dataset** consisting of AS-OCT volumes captured from 66 eyes, which includes 1584 annotated sequences. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method.

Additionally, the authors refer to a **public AS-OCT dataset**, the **AGE dataset**, which contains 3200 AS-OCT images. This dataset is also important for their evaluation and comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**:

1. For the **private dataset**, the authors do not provide a specific citation since it is derived from their own collection of AS-OCT images. However, I will note that it is based on human expert annotations from dynamic gonioscopic examinations.

2. For the **AGE dataset**, the citation is:
   > Fu, H., Li, F., Sun, X., et al. *AGE Challenge: Angle Closure Glaucoma Evaluation in Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography*. arXiv (2020).

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights their key characteristics and citations. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.
