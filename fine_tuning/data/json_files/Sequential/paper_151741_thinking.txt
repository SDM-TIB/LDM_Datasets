To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compiler-based GPU Memory Footprint Reduction for LSTM RNN Training" by Bojian Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses evaluating the proposed method on various machine learning workloads, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, I will look for any sections that mention datasets directly, such as "Dataset," "Data," or "Experiments."

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets in the **Methodology** and **Evaluation** sections:

1. **IWSLT15 English-Vietnamese Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the NMT model. It is a well-known dataset for machine translation tasks.

2. **WMT16 English-German Dataset**: Another dataset used for training the NMT model, specifically for the English-German translation task.

3. **LibriSpeech Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the DeepSpeech2 model, which is a state-of-the-art speech recognition model.

4. **ImageNet Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the ResNet model, which is a popular dataset for image classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For the **IWSLT15 English-Vietnamese Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. D. Manning, M.-T. Luong, A. See, and H. Pham. *Neural Machine Translation*. https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/nmt/

- For the **WMT16 English-German Dataset**, the citation is:
  > WMT16. *ACL 2016 First Conference on Machine Translation*. https://www.statmt.org/wmt16/translation-task.html

- For the **LibriSpeech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP). IEEE, 5206–5210.

- For the **ImageNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR). IEEE, 248–255.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
