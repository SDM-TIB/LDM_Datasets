To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PVGRU: Generating Diverse and Relevant Dialogue Responses via Pseudo-Variational Mechanism" by Yongkang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "two benchmark datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors refer to two datasets: 

1. **DailyDialog**: This dataset is described as a high-quality multi-turn dialogue dataset about daily life, consisting of 11,118 context-response pairs for training, 1,000 pairs for validation, and 1,000 pairs for testing.

2. **DSTC7-AVSD**: This dataset is from the Audio Visual Scene-aware Dialog of the DSTC7 challenge, containing 76,590 context-response pairs for training, 17,870 pairs for validation, and 1,710 pairs for testing. The authors mention that they utilize textual knowledge from this dataset.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for the datasets:

- For **DailyDialog**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Su, H., Shen, X., Wen, J., Cao, Z., & Niu, S. (2017). DailyDialog: A manually labelled multi-turn dialogue dataset. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.03957*.

- For **DSTC7-AVSD**, the citation is:
  > Alamri, H., Cartillier, V., Das, A., Wang, J., Cherian, A., Essa, I., Batra, D., Marks, T. K., Hori, C., Anderson, P., et al. (2019). Audio visual scene-aware dialog. In *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (pp. 7558â€“7567).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
