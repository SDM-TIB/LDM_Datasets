To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Doctor2Vec: Dynamic Doctor Representation Learning for Clinical Trial Recruitment" by Siddharth Biswal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and mentions that the method was validated on "large real-world trials and EHR data including 2,609 trials, 25K doctors, and 430K patients." This indicates that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In the **Data Source section**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **IQVIA Clinical Trial Database**: This dataset contains 2,609 clinical trials formed during 2014 and 2019, including 25,894 doctors across 28 countries. It includes both unstructured eligibility criteria and categorical features.

2. **Real World Patient Claims Dataset**: This dataset contains longitudinal treatment history from 430,239 patients over 7 years, including medical codes about diagnosis, procedure, medication, and information about doctors.

3. **Clinical Trial Descriptions from ClinicalTrials.gov**: This dataset includes publicly available clinical trial descriptions that were matched with the patient claims dataset on NCT ID.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from specific databases and not traditional publications, I will note the sources as follows:

- For the **IQVIA Clinical Trial Database**, the citation is:
  > IQVIA. *IQVIAâ€™s Real-World Patient and Clinical Trial Database*. Available upon request.

- For the **Real World Patient Claims Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Database 1. *Longitudinal Treatment History Dataset*. Available upon request.

- For the **Clinical Trial Descriptions**, the citation is:
  > ClinicalTrials.gov. *Clinical Trial Database*. Available at https://clinicaltrials.gov/.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and attributed to its source. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.
