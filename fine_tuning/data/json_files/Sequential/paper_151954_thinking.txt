To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attend and Diagnose: Clinical Time Series Analysis using Attention Models" by Huan Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize the **MIMIC-III benchmark datasets**, which suggests that there is a significant dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of clinical data analysis and mention the MIMIC-III database as a key resource. This reinforces the idea that MIMIC-III is central to their research.

In the **MIMIC-III Benchmarks & Formulation section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the tasks they evaluate their model on, which are derived from the MIMIC-III database. They mention that the MIMIC-III database consists of de-identified information about patients admitted to critical care units, and they specify the cohort size and the types of data included.

The paper outlines four specific benchmark tasks that utilize the MIMIC-III dataset:

1. **In Hospital Mortality**: A binary classification task predicting whether a patient dies during hospitalization.
2. **Decompensation**: A task predicting if a patient will die within the next 24 hours.
3. **Length of Stay**: A task forecasting the length of a patient's stay in the hospital.
4. **Phenotyping**: A multi-label classification task predicting various disease conditions based on patient data.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **MIMIC-III**:
  > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Lehman, L.-w. H., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., Moody, B., Szolovits, P., Celi, L. A., & Mark, R. G. (2016). MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data*, 3.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extraction:

1. **MIMIC-III Database**: A comprehensive dataset containing clinical data from patients in critical care units, used for various predictive modeling tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for each dataset.
