To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rumor Detection on Twitter Using Multiloss Hierarchical BiLSTM with an Attenuation Factor" by Yudianto Sujana et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on two rumor datasets derived from tweets during breaking news, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly the **Data Collection** subsection, where the authors provide statistics and descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **PHEME 2017**: This dataset consists of 49,345 users, 103,212 posts, and 5,802 events, with an average of 13.6 words per post and 17.8 posts per event. The dataset is balanced with 34% rumors and 66% non-rumors.

2. **PHEME 2018**: This dataset includes 50,593 users, 105,354 posts, and 6,425 events, with similar average statistics as the 2017 dataset, but with a slightly higher balance of 37.4% rumors.

The authors provide a table (Table 2) summarizing the statistics of these datasets, which confirms their significance in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets, but I can infer that they are likely derived from the PHEME project, which is a well-known dataset in the field of rumor detection.

To ensure accuracy, I will look for the original PHEME dataset papers or documentation. The relevant citation for the PHEME datasets is:

- For **PHEME 2017** and **PHEME 2018**, the citation is:
  > Zubiaga, A., Liakata, M., & Procter, R. (2016). Learning Reporting Dynamics during Breaking News for Rumour Detection in Social Media. Computing Research Repository, arXiv:1610.07363. Version 1.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
