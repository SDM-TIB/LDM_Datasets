To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SPREADSHEETCODER: Formula Prediction from Semi-structured Context" by Xinyun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors trained their model on a large dataset of spreadsheets, which indicates that there is a dataset involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they constructed. Here, they mention that they collected 46,000 Google Sheets with formulas, which were split into training, validation, and testing sets. The breakdown is as follows:

- **Training set**: 42,000 samples
- **Validation set**: 2,300 samples
- **Testing set**: 1,700 samples

The authors also mention that the dataset includes 770,000 training samples after filtering, along with 42,000 validation samples and 34,000 testing samples. This detailed breakdown is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

I will also check for any additional datasets mentioned in the **related work** or **experiments** sections, as they may reference other datasets used for comparison or evaluation.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the full citations for the datasets. The authors do not provide specific citations for the datasets they created, but they reference the Enron corpus, which is a well-known dataset. The citation for the Enron corpus is:

- **Enron Corpus**: 
  > Klimt, B., & Yang, Y. (2004). Introducing the Enron corpus. In CEAS.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets, including their sizes and any relevant details, along with the proper citations.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries based on the information collected from the paper.
