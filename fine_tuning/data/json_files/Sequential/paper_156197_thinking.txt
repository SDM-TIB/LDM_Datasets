To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Writer Adaptation for Offline Text Recognition" by Tobias van der Werff et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used in prior work, which can give clues about the datasets relevant to this study.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges in handwriting recognition and refer to various works that may have utilized specific datasets. I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly named or implied.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **IAM dataset** for evaluation, which is crucial for my extraction process.

In **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, the authors describe the IAM dataset in detail, stating that it consists of English handwritten texts contributed by 657 writers, totaling 1,539 handwritten pages and 115,320 segmented words. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides essential details for citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IAM dataset. The citation is as follows:
> U-V Marti and Horst Bunke. *The IAM Database: An English Sentence Database for Offline Handwriting Recognition*. International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition, 5(1):39â€“46, 2002.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **IAM Dataset**: A comprehensive dataset for handwritten text recognition, consisting of 115,320 segmented words from 657 writers.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that the full citation is included for the IAM dataset. This methodical approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
