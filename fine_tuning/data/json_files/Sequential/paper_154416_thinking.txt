To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Previous Acoustic Context to Improve Text-to-Speech Synthesis" by Pilar Oplustil Gallegos and Simon King, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses leveraging the sequential nature of speech data, which suggests that datasets related to speech synthesis might be involved.

Next, I will examine the **system description** section, particularly **section 3.4 (Data and Tools)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they refer to the **LJ Speech Dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for text-to-speech synthesis.

I will note the details provided about the LJ Speech Dataset, including its composition and how it was pre-processed into utterances. The authors mention that it consists of seven books and that utterances are chunked at silences, which is important contextual information.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the LJ Speech Dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Keith Ito and Linda Johnson. *The LJ Speech Dataset*. Available at: https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/, 2017.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the LJ Speech Dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
