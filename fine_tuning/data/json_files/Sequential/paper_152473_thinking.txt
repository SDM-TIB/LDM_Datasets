To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SWDE: A Sub-Word And Document Embedding Based Engine for Clickbait Detection" by Vaibhav Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their model on **2538 posts**, which suggests that there is a dataset involved, likely related to clickbait detection.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide more context about the datasets used. They mention that they trained their model on **17000 records**, which implies that there is a specific dataset they utilized for training and testing.

In the **evaluation results section**, the authors discuss their experiments and mention that they trained their model over **17000 records** and tested it on **2538 disjoint instances**. However, they do not explicitly name the dataset in this section. I will need to look for any references to datasets in the **related work section** or **model architecture section**.

Upon reviewing the **related work**, I find that the authors reference a crowdsourced dataset of tweets annotated for clickbait detection, which is crucial for my extraction. They cite the work of Potthast et al. (2017) that crowdsourced a large corpus of clickbait on Twitter. This indicates that the dataset they used is likely derived from this work.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation is:

- For the **crowdsourced dataset of tweets**:
  > M. Potthast, T. Gollub, K. Komlossy, S. Schuster, M. Wiegmann, E. Garces, M. Hagen, and B. Stein. *Crowdsourcing a Large Corpus of Clickbait on Twitter*. In (to appear), 2017.

Additionally, I will note that the authors trained their model on **17000 records** and tested it on **2538 posts**, which are part of the same dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the citation, into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations.
