To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time Series Alignment with Global Invariances" by Titouan Vayer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract discusses the framework's versatility and its application to both simulated and real-world data, which suggests that datasets are involved, but does not specify any names.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention the importance of learning under distribution shift and refer to various applications, but again, no specific datasets are named.

Moving on to the **experiments section (Section 4)**, I will look for any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. In **Section 4.4 (Time series forecasting)**, the authors state that they use the **Human3.6M dataset** for their experiments. This dataset consists of 3.6 million video frames of human movements recorded in a controlled indoor motion capture setting, which is crucial for understanding their methodology.

Additionally, in **Section 4.5 (Cover song identification)**, the authors mention using the **covers80 dataset**, which consists of 80 cover pairs of pop songs. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **Human3.6M dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ionescu, C., Papava, D., Olaru, V., & Sminchisescu, C. (2014). Human3.6m: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3D human sensing in natural environments. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 36(7), 1325-1339.

2. For the **covers80 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ellis, D. P., & Cotton, C. V. (2007). The 2007 Labrosa cover song detection system. *In Proceedings of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference*.

After compiling this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Human3.6M dataset**: A large dataset containing 3.6 million video frames of human movements, used for human motion forecasting.
- **covers80 dataset**: A dataset consisting of 80 pairs of cover songs, used for evaluating cover song identification methods.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets with their respective citations, ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis.
