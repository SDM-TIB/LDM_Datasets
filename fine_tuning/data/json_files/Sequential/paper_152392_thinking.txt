To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constructing Long Short-Term Memory Based Deep Recurrent Neural Networks for Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition" by Xiangang Li and Xihong Wu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of deep LSTM networks on a large vocabulary conversational telephone speech recognition task, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **HKUST Mandarin Chinese conversational telephone speech recognition corpus**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

In **Section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors provide details about the corpus, stating that it contains 150 hours of speech and is collected and transcribed by Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). This section confirms the dataset's relevance to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the HKUST dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **HKUST Mandarin Chinese conversational telephone speech recognition corpus**, the citation is:
  > Y. Liu, P. Fung, Y. Yang, and et al., “HKUST/MTS: A Very Large Scale Mandarin Telephone Speech Corpus,” in ISCSLP, 2006, pp. 724–735.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation for future reference.
