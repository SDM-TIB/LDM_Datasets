To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Capsule Attention for Multimodal EEG-EOG Representation Learning with Application to Driver Vigilance Estimation" by Guangyi Zhang and Ali Etemad, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of EEG and EOG for driver vigilance estimation, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these modalities.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were collected or structured.

In this paper, the authors mention the **SEED-VIG dataset**. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including the number of participants, the type of data collected (EEG and EOG), the equipment used, and the context of data collection (e.g., driving simulation).

The relevant details for the SEED-VIG dataset are as follows:
- It consists of data collected from **23 participants**.
- Both **EEG** and **EOG** signals were recorded using the **ESI Neuroscan system** at a sampling rate of **1000 Hz**.
- The dataset includes **17 EEG channels** from various brain regions and **4 EOG channels** from the forehead.
- Participants engaged in a driving simulation for approximately **120 minutes**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SEED-VIG dataset. The citation is as follows:
> W.-L. Zheng and B.-L. Lu. "A multimodal approach to estimating vigilance using EEG and forehead EOG." *Journal of Neural Engineering*, vol. 14, no. 2, p. 026017, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation for the SEED-VIG dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
