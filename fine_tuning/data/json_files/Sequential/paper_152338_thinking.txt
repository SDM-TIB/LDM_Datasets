To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Latent Variable Recurrent Neural Network for Discourse Relation Language Models" by Yangfeng Ji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the model is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Data and Implementation)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB)**: This dataset is annotated on a corpus of Wall Street Journal articles and provides low-level discourse annotations. The authors explain that it includes both explicit and implicit discourse relations, but they focus on implicit relations for their model.

2. **Switchboard Dialog Act Corpus (SWDA)**: This dataset is based on human-human conversational telephone speech and includes annotations for various speech acts. The authors describe how they use this dataset for dialog act classification.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Penn Discourse Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Rashmi Prasad, Nikhil Dinesh, Alan Lee, Eleni Miltsakaki, Livio Robaldo, Aravind Joshi, and Bonnie Webber. *The Penn Discourse Treebank 2.0*. In Proceedings of LREC, 2008.

- For the **Switchboard Dialog Act Corpus**, the citation is:
  > John J. Godfrey, Edward C. Holliman, and Jane McDaniel. *Switchboard: Telephone speech corpus for research and development*. In ICASSP, volume 1, pages 517â€“520, 1992.

Now that I have the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

This process ensures that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper along with their full citations, which is crucial for proper attribution and further research.
