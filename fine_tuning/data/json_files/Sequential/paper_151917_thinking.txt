To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gated Recurrent Networks for Seizure Detection" by M. Golmohammadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **TUH EEG Corpus (TUEEG)** for EEG research, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the study. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of this dataset in the context of seizure detection.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. In this case, I will focus on the **Results** section, where the authors discuss the **TUH EEG Seizure Corpus (TUSZ)**. This dataset is described as a subset of the TUH EEG Corpus that is specifically annotated for seizure events. The paper provides a summary of the corpus, including the number of patients, sessions, and files, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets mentioned:

1. **TUH EEG Corpus (TUEEG)**: The citation is:
   > I. Obeid and J. Picone, "The Temple University Hospital EEG Data Corpus," *Frontiers in Neuroscience*, vol. 10, p. 196, 2016.

2. **TUH EEG Seizure Corpus (TUSZ)**: The citation is:
   > M. Golmohammadi et al., "The TUH EEG Seizure Corpus," in *Proceedings of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society Annual Meeting*, 2017, p. 1.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for any further analysis or replication of the study.
