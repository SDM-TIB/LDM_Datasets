To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Literature on Hand GESTURE Recognition using Graph based methods" by Neha Baranwal and Varun Sharma, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study focuses on hand gesture recognition using point clouds and mentions the SHREC’17 dataset, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **literature survey and methods sections** for any additional datasets that may be referenced. In the literature survey, the authors discuss various methodologies and techniques, but I will specifically look for mentions of datasets used in experiments or evaluations.

In the **results and discussion sections**, I will look for any comparisons made with other datasets or benchmarks. The authors mention the SHREC’17 dataset multiple times, indicating its importance in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **SHREC’17 Dataset**: This dataset is explicitly mentioned as the primary dataset used for training and testing the proposed methodology. The authors state that their results were normalized against this dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SHREC’17 dataset. The citation is typically found in the references, and I will ensure to format it correctly.

The citation for the SHREC’17 dataset is:
> "SHREC'17: 3D Hand Gesture Recognition Challenge." In Proceedings of the 3D Object Retrieval Challenge, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and citations clearly, ensuring that I have captured all necessary information for future reference or processing.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the SHREC’17 dataset, ensuring that the citation is included in the appropriate format.
