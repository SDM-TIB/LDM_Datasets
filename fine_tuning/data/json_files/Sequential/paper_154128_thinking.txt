To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Query Focused Multi-document Summarisation of Biomedical Texts" by Diego Mollá et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the participation in the BioASQ Challenge, which suggests that datasets related to biomedical texts are likely involved. I will look for any specific dataset names or descriptions in these sections.

Next, I will review the **experiments** section, particularly focusing on any subsections that discuss datasets. In this paper, the authors mention the **BioASQ8b training data** and the **BioASQ7b dataset**. I will need to gather details about these datasets, including their sizes and any specific characteristics mentioned.

In the **Results and Discussion** section, the authors provide insights into how the datasets were used in their experiments, which will help confirm their relevance and application.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **BioASQ7b Dataset**: The paper describes this dataset as consisting of 2,747 questions, which were divided into a training set and a testing set. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Molla, D., & Jones, C. (2020). *Classification betters regression in query-based multi-document summarisation techniques for question answering*. In P. Cellier & K. Driessens (Eds.), Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases (pp. 624–635). Springer International Publishing.

2. **BioASQ8b Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3,243 questions, also divided into training and testing sets. The citation for this dataset is the same as for BioASQ7b, as it is part of the same challenge:
   > Molla, D., & Jones, C. (2020). *Classification betters regression in query-based multi-document summarisation techniques for question answering*. In P. Cellier & K. Driessens (Eds.), Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases (pp. 624–635). Springer International Publishing.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
