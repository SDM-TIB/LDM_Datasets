To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differential Radial Basis Function Network for Sequence Modelling" by Kojo Sarfo Gyamfi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their model on the **logistic map chaotic timeseries** and **30 real-world timeseries provided by Walmart in the M5 forecasting competition**. This suggests that there are at least two datasets to extract.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about these datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of the radial basis function network and its applications, but it does not provide specific dataset names or details.

I will then look into **section 4 (Experimental Validation)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for validation. In **section 4.1**, the authors describe the **logistic map** dataset, which consists of 1000 observations generated from the logistic map equation. They also mention that they added Gaussian noise to simulate observational noise.

In **section 4.2**, the authors discuss the **M5 competition dataset**, which consists of 42,840 individual timeseries data made available by Walmart. They specify that they worked with a level 8 aggregation of this dataset, which includes 30 different timeseries of unit sales across various stores and product categories.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. For the **logistic map chaotic timeseries**, the paper does not provide a specific citation since it is a well-known mathematical model. However, I can reference the original source:
   > J. D. Farmer, J. J. Sidorowich, "Predicting chaotic time series," *Physical Review Letters*, vol. 59, no. 8, pp. 845, 1987.

2. For the **M5 competition dataset**, the citation is:
   > S. Makridakis, "The M5 competition," *2020*.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
