To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compositional generalization in seq2seq convolutional networks" by Roberto Dessì and Marco Baroni, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract references the **SCAN dataset**, which is crucial for the experiments discussed in the paper. This indicates that I should look for more details about this dataset in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (SCAN)**, where the authors describe the SCAN dataset in detail. They explain that SCAN is designed to study compositionality in a command execution environment, and they mention that it includes various train/test splits. Specifically, they refer to the **random split** and the **jump split**, which are used in their experiments. This section provides essential information about how the dataset is structured and how it is utilized in the research.

In **section 3 (Experimental setup)**, the authors discuss their experimental methodology, confirming that they used the SCAN dataset for their evaluations. This reinforces the importance of the SCAN dataset in their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the SCAN dataset. The original paper that introduced the SCAN dataset is authored by Brenden Lake and Marco Baroni, and it is cited as follows:

- For the SCAN dataset, the citation is:
  > Brenden Lake and Marco Baroni. 2018. Generalization without systematicity: On the compositional skills of sequence-to-sequence recurrent networks. In Proceedings of ICML, pages 2879–2888, Stockholm, Sweden.

Since the SCAN dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's details and citation.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the SCAN dataset, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
