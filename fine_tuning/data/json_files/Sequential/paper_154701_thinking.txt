To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Phrase break prediction with bidirectional encoder representations in Japanese text-to-speech synthesis" by Kosuke Futamata et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experimental settings** sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of phrase break prediction in TTS systems but do not specify any datasets. I will then move to the **experimental settings** section, where the authors describe their dataset collection process.

In **section 4.1 (Experimental setting)**, the authors mention that they collected **99,907 utterances** for their experiments. They specify that each utterance was transcribed and had silence between words, with word transitions marked as phrase breaks. They also detail how the dataset was split into three subsets: **98,807 for training, 500 for validation, and 500 for testing**. This indicates that the dataset is substantial and specifically tailored for the task of phrase break prediction.

Next, I will look for the full citation of the dataset mentioned. The authors do not provide a formal citation for the dataset in the references section, as it appears to be a custom dataset created for their study. However, I will note that the dataset is based on utterances recorded by a single Japanese professional speaker, which is relevant information.

Now, I will compile the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Custom Japanese Phrase Break Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset containing 99,907 utterances, where each utterance was transcribed with silence between words. Word transitions with a silence of more than 200 ms were marked as phrase breaks. The dataset is split into three subsets: 98,807 for training, 500 for validation, and 500 for testing.
   - **Citation**: Not formally cited in the paper, but based on recordings from a single Japanese professional speaker.

Since the dataset is not formally published or cited in a standard manner, I will note that in the output. 

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that I include all relevant details for clarity and future reference.
