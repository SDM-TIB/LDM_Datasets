To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training recurrent neural networks robust to incomplete data: application to Alzheimer’s disease progression modeling" by Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes data from the **Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)**, which suggests that this is a primary dataset used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where the authors describe the data used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **TADPOLE challenge dataset**, which is derived from the ADNI database. This dataset is crucial for understanding the progression of Alzheimer’s disease and includes various biomarkers.

In the **data section**, the authors provide details about the TADPOLE dataset, including the number of subjects, the types of biomarkers collected, and the time points at which data was collected. They mention that the dataset includes roughly 1,500 biomarkers from 1,737 subjects over 12,741 visits, which is significant information for dataset extraction.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations I need to extract are:

1. **Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)**:
   > Petersen, R.C., Aisen, P., Beckett, L., Donohue, M., Gamst, A., Harvey, D., Jack, C., Jagust, W., Shaw, L., Toga, A., Trojanowski, J., Weiner, M. (2010). *Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): clinical characterization*. Neurology, 74(20), 201–209.

2. **TADPOLE challenge dataset**:
   > Marinescu, R.V., Oxtoby, N.P., Young, A.L., Bron, E.E., Toga, A.W., Weiner, M.W., Barkhof, F., Fox, N.C., Klein, S., Alexander, D.C. (2018). *TADPOLE challenge: Prediction of longitudinal evolution in Alzheimer’s disease*. CoRR, abs/1805.03909.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
