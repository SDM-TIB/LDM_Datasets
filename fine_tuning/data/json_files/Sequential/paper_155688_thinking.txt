To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stock Volatility Prediction using Time Series and Deep Learning Approach" by Ananda Chatterjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that stock price data was obtained from Yahoo Finance, which suggests that this is a primary dataset used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** where the authors describe how they collected and utilized the data. In this section, they specify that stock price data for three sectors—banking, information technology (IT), and pharma—was extracted from Yahoo Finance for the period from January 2017 to December 2021. This gives me the names of the sectors involved but not the specific datasets yet.

I will then look for any explicit mention of datasets in the **results** and **conclusion sections**. The authors discuss the performance of various models on the stock data but do not provide additional datasets beyond what has already been mentioned.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **Yahoo Finance Stock Price Data**: This dataset includes stock prices for the banking, IT, and pharma sectors from January 2017 to December 2021. The authors used this data to train and test their models.

Next, I will check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets. However, since the dataset is sourced from Yahoo Finance, it may not have a formal citation like academic datasets. Instead, I will note it as follows:

- **Yahoo Finance Stock Price Data**: 
  > Yahoo Finance. *Stock Price Data for NSE Sectors*. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com (Accessed: [insert access date]).

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring that I have included the necessary details and citations. This will allow for a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research.
