To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scan, Attend and Read: End-to-End Handwritten Paragraph Recognition with MDLSTM Attention" by Ronaldo Messina et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **IAM Database**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the IAM Database. They describe it as consisting of images of handwritten English text documents produced by 657 writers, with specific details about the training, validation, and test sets. This section confirms that the IAM Database is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IAM Database. The relevant citation is:

- For the **IAM Database**, the citation is:
  > U-V Marti and Horst Bunke. *The IAM-database: an English sentence database for offline handwriting recognition*. International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition, 5(1):39â€“46, 2002.

Since the IAM Database is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the IAM Database, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be ready for review or further processing.
