To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COVID-19 Fake News Detection Using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Based Models" by Yuxiang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the importance of detecting fake news during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context but does not name any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methods)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **COVID-19 Fake News Detection Dataset**, which is sourced from Kaggle. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of entries and the variables included (id, tweet, and label).

The authors state that the dataset consists of:
- **Training data**: 6,420 entries
- **Testing data**: 2,140 entries

This section confirms that the dataset is indeed used for their experiments.

Now, I will retrieve the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as being available on Kaggle, so I will note the citation as follows:
- **COVID-19 Fake News Detection Dataset**: 
  > Elvina G. A. M. (2020). *COVID-19 Fake News Detection Dataset*. Kaggle. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/elvinagammed/covid19-fake-news-dataset-nlp

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
