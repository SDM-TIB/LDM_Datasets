To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scene Compliant Trajectory Forecast with Agent-Centric Spatio-Temporal Grids" by Daniela Ridel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the model's performance is evaluated on the **Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD)**, which is a clear indication that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors specifically mention using the **Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD)** for their experiments, which confirms its significance.

I will then check the **experimental analysis** section, where the authors describe the SDD dataset in detail. They mention that the SDD dataset comprises various scenarios captured by a drone's camera, with pixel-wise labeled trajectories for different agents, including pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's context and application.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the Stanford Drone Dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Robicquet, A., Sadeghian, A., Alahi, A., & Savarese, S. (2016). Learning social etiquette: Human trajectory understanding in crowded scenes. In *European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)*.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the SDD dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the dataset used in the research paper.
