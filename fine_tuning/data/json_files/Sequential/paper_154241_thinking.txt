To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quasi-Periodic WaveNet: An Autoregressive Raw Waveform Generative Model with Pitch-dependent Dilated Convolution Neural Network" by Yi-Chiao Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed model and its applications, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets that their model is evaluated against. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include dataset names.

Then, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** in detail. These sections typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using datasets for training and evaluation, particularly in the context of speech generation. I will note any datasets that are explicitly named or described, such as the CMU ARCTIC dataset, which is commonly used for speech synthesis research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention the CMU ARCTIC dataset, I would look for its citation, which is typically formatted as follows:
> Kominek, J., & Black, A. W. (2003). The CMU ARCTIC speech databases for speech synthesis research. CMU-LTI-03-177.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identify specific datasets used in the research.
3. Check the References section for full citations of each dataset.
4. Compile the dataset information for clarity and accessibility.
