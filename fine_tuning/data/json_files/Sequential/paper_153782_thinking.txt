To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Generic Graph-based Neural Architecture Encoding Scheme for Predictor-based NAS" by Xuefei Ning et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific dataset names, descriptions, and the context in which they are used. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets: **NAS-Bench-101** and **NAS-Bench-201**.

1. **NAS-Bench-101**: This dataset is described as providing the performances of 423,624 unique architectures in an operation-on-node (OON) search space. The paper states that the first 90% of the architectures are used for training, while the remaining 10% are used for testing.

2. **NAS-Bench-201**: This dataset contains the performances of 15,625 architectures in an operation-on-edge (OOE) search space. Similar to NAS-Bench-101, the first 50% of the architectures are used for training, and the other half for testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **NAS-Bench-101**, the citation is:
  > Ying, C., Klein, A., Real, E., Christiansen, E., Murphy, K., & Hutter, F. (2019). *NAS-Bench-101: Towards reproducible neural architecture search*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.09635.

- For **NAS-Bench-201**, the citation is:
  > Dong, X., & Yang, Y. (2020). *NAS-Bench-201: Extending the scope of reproducible neural architecture search*. International Conference on Learning Representations. Retrieved from https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJxyZkBKDr.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in any subsequent work or analysis.
