To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatio-Temporal Event Segmentation and Localization for Wildlife Extended Videos" by Ramy Mounir et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on a dataset collected over 10 days of continuous wildlife monitoring, which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology** and **experimental evaluation** sections, particularly section IV (Experimental Evaluation), where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of 10 days (254 hours) of continuous monitoring of a nest of the Kagu, a flightless bird from New Caledonia. They also provide information about the activities being annotated, which include feeding the chick, incubation/brooding, and nest building.

In this section, I will extract the following details about the dataset:

1. **Kagu Bird Wildlife Monitoring Dataset**: This dataset is unique as it spans over 10 days and includes annotations for various bird activities. The authors note that they will make this dataset available to the research community, which is important for future reference.

Now, I will check the **acknowledgment** and **references** sections to find the full citation for the dataset. The acknowledgment mentions that the dataset was made possible through funding from the Polish National Science Centre, but it does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself. Since the dataset is described as the first of its kind, I will treat it as a unique dataset without a formal citation from a published source.

Thus, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Kagu Bird Wildlife Monitoring Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset consisting of 10 days (254 hours) of continuous monitoring of a nest of the Kagu bird, including annotations for activities such as feeding the chick, incubation/brooding, and nest building.
- **Citation**: Since there is no formal citation provided in the references, I will note that the dataset is available through the authors' project page.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their significance as presented in the paper.
