To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Tensor-Train LSTM for Spatio-Temporal Learning" by Jiahao Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **Moving-MNIST-2 Dataset**: This dataset consists of videos generated by moving two digits from the MNIST dataset within a black canvas. The authors state that they generated 10,000 training videos, 3,000 validation videos, and 5,000 test videos.

2. **KTH Action Dataset**: This dataset contains videos of individuals performing various actions. The authors specify that they used persons 1-16 for training and 17-25 for testing, with each frame resized to 128 × 128 pixels.

3. **Something-Something V2 Dataset**: This dataset is used for activity recognition and contains a subset of 41 categories with a total of 55,111 training videos and 7,518 test videos.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Moving-MNIST-2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nitish Srivastava, Elman Mansimov, and Ruslan Salakhudinov. *Unsupervised learning of video representations using lstms*. In International conference on machine learning, pages 843–852, 2015.

- For the **KTH Action Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ivan Laptev, Barbara Caputo, et al. *Recognizing human actions: a local svm approach*. In null, pages 32–36. IEEE, 2004.

- For the **Something-Something V2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Raghav Goyal, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, Vincent Michalski, Joanna Materzynska, Susanne Westphal, Heuna Kim, Valentin Haenel, Ingo Fruend, Peter Yianilos, Moritz Mueller-Freitag, et al. *The "something something" video database for learning and evaluating visual common sense*. In ICCV, volume 1, page 5, 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
