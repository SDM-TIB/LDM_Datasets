To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecasting VIX using Bayesian Deep Learning" by Héctor J. Hortúa and Andrés Mora, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on forecasting the volatility index (VIX) using various deep learning models, but it does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 6 (Data)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their analysis. Here, they state that the VIX time series data was collected from Yahoo Finance, covering daily observations from August 22, 2013, to July 31, 2023. This section provides key details about the dataset, including the time frame and source.

In **section 7 (Methodology)**, the authors elaborate on how the VIX dataset was processed, including the creation of a windowed dataset for forecasting purposes. They mention that the dataset consists of 2500 observations, which confirms the dataset's size and structure.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from Yahoo Finance, I will format the citation accordingly. The citation for the VIX dataset will be:

> Yahoo Finance. *VIX Historical Data*. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EVIX/history?p=%5EVIX (Accessed: [insert access date]).

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.

After completing these steps, I will be ready to present the dataset information in the required format for further processing or review.
