To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Arrhythmia Classification Using CGAN-Augmented ECG Signals" by Edmond Adib et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset**, indicating that this is a key dataset for the study.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their approach to data augmentation and the specific datasets used. In this section, they mention that the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset** is utilized to train their models, specifically noting its characteristics, such as containing 48 recordings and being highly imbalanced.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to confirm that the MIT-BIH dataset is indeed the primary dataset used for training and evaluation. The authors discuss the performance metrics based on this dataset, which further solidifies its importance in their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> G. B. Moody and R. G. Mark. "The impact of the mit-bih arrhythmia database." *IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine*, vol. 20, no. 3, pp. 45â€“50, 2001.

Since the MIT-BIH dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
