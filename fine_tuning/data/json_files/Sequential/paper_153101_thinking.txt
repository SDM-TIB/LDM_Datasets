To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single-Path Mobile AutoML: Efficient ConvNet Design and NAS Hyperparameter Optimization" by Dimitrios Stamoulis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a novel NAS method and states that the method achieves state-of-the-art results on **ImageNet**. This indicates that ImageNet is likely a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to see if there are any specific datasets mentioned. In this section, the authors discuss their method's performance on **ImageNet**, which is a well-known dataset for image classification tasks. They also mention using **COCO** (Common Objects in Context) for object detection performance evaluation, indicating that this dataset is also part of their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are crucial for proper attribution:

1. For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
   > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. "ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database." In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 248–255, 2009.

2. For **COCO**, the citation is:
   > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. "Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context." In European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 740–755, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I maintain the integrity of the references as they appear in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
