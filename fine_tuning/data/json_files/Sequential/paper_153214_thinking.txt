To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Entropy-Enhanced Multimodal Attention Model for Scene-Aware Dialogue Generation" by Kuan-Yen Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the **Audio Visual Scene-aware Dialog (AVSD) task**, which indicates that a specific dataset is likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the AVSD task and its modalities. They reference the **Dialog System Technology Challenge (DSTC7)**, which suggests that this challenge may involve a dataset relevant to their work.

In the **data section**, the authors provide specific details about the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the official dataset contains **7,659 training samples, 1,787 validation samples, and 1,710 testing samples**. This section is crucial as it provides quantitative details about the dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset associated with the AVSD task. The authors reference the work by Yoshino et al. (2018) regarding the DSTC7, which is likely the source of the dataset.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Yoshino, K.; Hori, C.; Perez, J.; Dâ€™Haro, L. F.; Polymenakos, L.; Gunasekara, C.; Lasecki, W. S.; Kummerfeld, J.; Galley, M.; Brockett, C.; Gao, J.; Dolan, B.; Gao, S.; Marks, T. K.; Parikh, D.; and Batra, D. 2018. The 7th Dialog System Technology Challenge. arXiv preprint.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is essential for proper attribution.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
