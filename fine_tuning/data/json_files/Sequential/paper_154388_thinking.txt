To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning Based Load Balancing for Improved QoS towards 6G" by Vishnu Vardhan Nimmalapudi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses the context of 6G and deep learning but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and results. Here, they state that "there is no dataset available online containing all traffic, P1, P2, P3 data in one place," which indicates that they created their own dataset for the study. This is a crucial point as it suggests that the dataset is original and not sourced from existing repositories.

The authors mention that they prepared a dataset generated using a Gaussian distribution. They provide details about the dataset, including that it contains 2800 training samples for each of the traffic categories (traffic, P1, P2, P3) and describes how the data was generated. This dataset is essential for their experiments, and I need to document it.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset. Since the dataset is original and created by the authors, I will cite it as follows:

- **Custom Dataset**: The dataset was generated by the authors using a Gaussian distribution, containing 2800 training samples for each of the traffic categories (traffic, P1, P2, P3). The dataset is not publicly available.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear reference for anyone looking to understand the data used in this research.

After completing these steps, I will have successfully extracted and documented the dataset from the paper.
