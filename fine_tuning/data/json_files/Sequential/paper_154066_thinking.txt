To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Learning for Video Description With Cluster-Regularized Ensemble Ranking" by David M. Chan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating approaches on two datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will note the names of these datasets for further investigation.

Next, I will look into **section 3.5 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **MSR-VTT**: This dataset is described as a large-scale benchmark for video description generation, consisting of 10,000 web video clips with 200,000 clip-description pairs.

2. **LSMDC**: This dataset combines two datasets (M-VAD and MPII-MD) and contains 118,081 clips from 202 unique films, with each clip having approximately one sentence of description.

To ensure I have the correct and complete citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations I need to extract are:

- For **MSR-VTT**, the citation is:
  > Xu, J., Mei, T., Yao, T., Rui, Y. (2016). *MSR-VTT: A large video description dataset for bridging video and language*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 5288–5296.

- For **LSMDC**, the citation is:
  > Rohrbach, A., Torabi, A., Rohrbach, M., Tandon, N., Pal, C., Larochelle, H., Courville, A., Schiele, B. (2017). *Movie description*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1), 94–120.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured accurately.
