To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Combination Model Based on Sequential General Variational Mode Decomposition Method for Time Series Prediction" by Wei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors selected **online store sales** and **Australian beer sales** as datasets for their experiments, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **methodology** and **experimental results sections**. In the methodology, the authors mention that they used historical sales data from an online store, specifying that the dataset consists of **1000 data points**. They also describe the Australian beer production dataset, which is used to investigate forecasting methods for non-monotonic trends.

I will then check the **results section** to confirm the datasets' usage in the experiments. The authors provide performance metrics for the models applied to both datasets, reinforcing that these are the primary datasets used in their analysis.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references section**. Since the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, I will note that the datasets are commonly used in time series forecasting literature. However, I will still provide a general citation format for the datasets based on their descriptions:

1. **Online Store Sales Dataset**: This dataset is typically used in various studies related to sales forecasting. A common reference for similar datasets is:
   > Hyndman, R.J., & Athanasopoulos, G. (2018). *Forecasting: Principles and Practice*. OTexts. Available at: https://otexts.com/fpp3/

2. **Australian Beer Sales Dataset**: This dataset is often referenced in time series analysis. A common citation for similar datasets is:
   > Hyndman, R.J., & Athanasopoulos, G. (2018). *Forecasting: Principles and Practice*. OTexts. Available at: https://otexts.com/fpp3/

After compiling this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research paper. This will allow for proper attribution and facilitate further research or replication of the study.
