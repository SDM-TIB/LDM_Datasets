To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoSlim: Towards One-Shot Architecture Search for Channel Numbers" by Jiahui Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of AutoSlim on various neural network architectures, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In section 4.1, the authors mention conducting experiments on **ImageNet** for evaluating their proposed method. This indicates that ImageNet is a dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **CIFAR10 experiments** mentioned in section 4.3. The authors state that they conducted experiments on the **CIFAR10 dataset** as well, comparing the performance of their optimized models against the default MobileNet v2 configurations.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
   > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009. CVPR 2009. IEEE Conference on. IEEE, 2009, pp. 248â€“255.

2. For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
   > A. Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Citeseer, Tech. Rep., 2009.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

- **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification tasks.
- **CIFAR10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, commonly used for training machine learning models.

Now, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
