To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "VOCBENCH: A Neural Vocoder Benchmark for Speech Synthesis" by Ehab A. AlBadawy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's purpose, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used in the experiments. In this case, the introduction mentions that the authors constructed three datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset and Experiments)**, where the authors detail the datasets used in their study. Here, they explicitly list the three datasets:

1. **LJ Speech Dataset**: This dataset consists of 13,100 short audio clips of a single speaker reading passages from non-fiction books. The authors provide details about the length of the clips and how they are split into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **LibriTTS Dataset**: This is a multi-speaker English corpus with approximately 585 hours of read English speech. The authors describe the subsets used for training and the number of speakers involved.

3. **VCTK Corpus**: This dataset includes speech data from 110 English speakers with various accents. The authors explain how the data is split for training, validation, and testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **LJ Speech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Keith Ito. *The LJ Speech Dataset*, 2017. Available at: https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/

- For the **LibriTTS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Heiga Zen, V. Dang, R. Clark, et al. *LibriTTS: A corpus derived from LibriSpeech for text-to-speech*. In Proceedings of Interspeech, 2019.

- For the **VCTK Corpus**, the citation is:
  > C. Veaux, J. Yamagishi, and K. MacDonald. *CSTR VCTK corpus: English multi-speaker corpus for CSTR voice cloning toolkit*, 2017.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
