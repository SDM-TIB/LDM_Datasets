To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparing and Contrasting Deep Learning Weather Prediction Backbones on Navier-Stokes and Atmospheric Dynamics" by Matthias Karlbauer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **WeatherBench dataset**, which is a strong indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional context or details about datasets. The authors discuss the **ERA5 reanalysis dataset** and its application in various models, which suggests that this dataset is also relevant.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 3.2 (Real-World Weather Data)**, the authors explicitly mention using the **WeatherBench dataset** and describe its characteristics. They also refer to the **ERA5 dataset**, which is crucial for their analysis.

Now, I will gather the necessary details for each dataset:

1. **WeatherBench Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating data-driven weather forecasting models. It is mentioned that WeatherBench was recently extended to WeatherBench2, which indicates its importance in the context of the paper.

2. **ERA5 Dataset**: This dataset is a reanalysis product from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and is used extensively in the paper. The authors note that it covers the globe with a specific resolution and includes various atmospheric variables.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **WeatherBench dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stephan Rasp, Peter D. Dueben, Sebastian Scher, Jonathan A. Weyn, Soukayna Mouatadid, and Nils Thuerey. *Weatherbench: A benchmark data set for data-driven weather forecasting*. Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems, 12(11):e2020MS002203, 2020.

- For the **ERA5 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hans Hersbach, Bill Bell, Paul Berrisford, Shoji Hirahara, András Horányi, Joaquín Muñoz-Sabater, Julien Nicolas, Carole Peubey, Raluca Radu, Dinand Schepers, et al. *The ERA5 global reanalysis*. Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 146(730):1999–2049, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper, along with their full citations for future reference.
