To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NAPG: Non-Autoregressive Program Generation for Hybrid Tabular-Textual Question Answering" by Tengxun Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to experiments conducted on the **ConvFinQA** and **MultiHiertt** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) to gather more detailed information about these datasets. In section 4.1, the authors provide a brief overview of both datasets:

1. **ConvFinQA**: This dataset is designed for modeling long-range, complex numerical reasoning paths in real-world conversations. It is mentioned that it poses significant challenges for question answering.

2. **MultiHiertt**: This dataset contains multiple hierarchical tables and longer unstructured text, requiring a more complex reasoning process across various tables and paragraphs to answer questions correctly.

In section 4.1, the authors also provide statistics about both datasets, including the average number of text words, table types, average number of tables, and the number of training, development, and test samples. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically provided in the context of the papers that introduced these datasets. 

- For **ConvFinQA**, the citation is:
  > Chen, Zhiyu, Shiyang Li, Charese Smiley, Zhiqiang Ma, Sameena Shah, and William Yang Wang. "ConvFinQA: Exploring the chain of numerical reasoning in conversational finance question answering." In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 6279–6292, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2022.

- For **MultiHiertt**, the citation is:
  > Zhao, Yilun, Yunxiang Li, Chenying Li, and Rui Zhang. "MultiHiertt: Numerical reasoning over multi-hierarchical tabular and textual data." In Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 6588–6600, 2022.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
