To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Hyperparameters for Deep LSTM-Networks for Sequence Labeling Tasks" by Nils Reimers and Iryna Gurevych, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Benchmark Tasks)**, where the authors provide a detailed overview of the tasks and datasets used for evaluation. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of the datasets, including their names and descriptions.

In this section, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Penn Treebank** for Part-of-Speech tagging (POS).
2. **CoNLL 2000** for Chunking.
3. **CoNLL 2003** for Named Entity Recognition (NER).
4. **ACE 2005** for Entity Recognition.
5. **TempEval 3** for Event Detection.

Each dataset is associated with specific tasks, and the authors provide details about the number of training and test sentences, as well as the number of tags used.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The citations I find are:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented by the authors.
