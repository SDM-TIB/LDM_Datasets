To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Deep Feature Calibration for Cross-Modal Joint Embedding Learning" by Zhongwei Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors use the **Recipe1M dataset** for technical descriptions and empirical validation, which indicates that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for any additional mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this section, the authors describe their evaluation metrics and mention that they evaluate their approach on the **Recipe1M dataset**, which consists of over 800K recipes and 1 million associated food images. This confirms that Recipe1M is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **related work** section to see if there are any other datasets referenced that might be relevant to their work. However, the focus remains on the Recipe1M dataset as the main dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Recipe1M dataset. The citation for the Recipe1M dataset is not provided in the paper, but I can infer that it is a well-known dataset in the field of cross-modal retrieval. The original paper that introduced the Recipe1M dataset is:

> Salvador, A., Hynes, N., Aytar, Y., Marin, J., Ofli, F., Weber, I., & Torralba, A. (2017). Learning cross-modal embeddings for cooking recipes and food images. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 3020â€“3028.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **Recipe1M Dataset**: This dataset contains over 800K recipes, including titles, lists of ingredients, and cooking instructions, along with 1 million associated food images. It is used for evaluating the proposed cross-modal embedding learning approach.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing.
