To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Synchronized Lyrics and Vocal Features for Music Emotion Detection" by Loreto Parisi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **Synchronized Lyrics Emotion Dataset**, which is a strong indication that this is a key dataset in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this case, the paper has a section titled **3. Synchronized Lyrics Emotion Dataset**, which provides detailed information about the dataset, including its structure and purpose.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset as containing synchronized lyrics collected from the Musixmatch platform, with specific attributes such as track ID, lyrics, start and end times, and emotion labels. This confirms that the **Synchronized Lyrics Emotion Dataset** is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from the Musixmatch platform, I will note that the citation for the dataset itself may not be explicitly listed, but I can reference the platform as follows:

- **Synchronized Lyrics Emotion Dataset**: 
  > Parisi, L., Francia, S., Olivastri, S., & Tavella, M. S. (2023). Exploiting Synchronized Lyrics and Vocal Features for Music Emotion Detection. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR).

Additionally, I will note that the dataset is based on the Musixmatch platform, which can be cited as:
  > Musixmatch. (n.d.). Musixmatch API. Retrieved from https://developer.musixmatch.com/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
