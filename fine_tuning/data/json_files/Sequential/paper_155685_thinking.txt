To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting the traffic flux in the city of Valencia with Deep Learning" by Miguel G. Folgado et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions using historical data from the city of Valencia's traffic sensor system, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Descriptive study)**, specifically **subsection 3.1 (Data-set description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the dataset as being composed of data from **3500 sensors distributed across 1500 road segments** in Valencia, which collect data on traffic intensity and velocity.

The authors specify that the historical data used for their analysis comes from the years **2016 and 2017**. This is crucial information as it defines the temporal scope of the dataset.

In addition, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. The paper mentions that the data is registered at the **Smart City Valencia infrastructure** and automatically transferred to the **Universitat Politècnica de València**. This information is important for citing the dataset accurately.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format. The dataset extracted from the paper is as follows:

1. **Valencia Traffic Sensor Dataset**: This dataset includes traffic data collected from nearly 3500 sensors across 1500 road segments in Valencia, covering the years 2016 and 2017. The data consists of total traffic intensity (number of vehicles) and velocity at each sensor within a specified time window.

Next, I will look for the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is associated with the Smart City Valencia infrastructure, I will cite it as follows:

- **Valencia Traffic Sensor Dataset**:
  > Ajuntament de Valencia. *Smart City Valencia*. 2022. URL: https://smartcity.valencia.es/en/

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and ready for any further processing or review.
