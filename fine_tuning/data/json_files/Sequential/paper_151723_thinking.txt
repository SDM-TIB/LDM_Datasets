To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional neural networks for chemical-disease relation extraction are improved with character-based word embeddings" by Dat Quoc Nguyen and Karin Verspoor, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **BioCreative-V CDR corpus**, which is a strong indication that this is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly focusing on **section 3 (Experiments)** and any subsections that discuss the dataset in detail. In section 3.1, the authors explicitly mention the **BC5CDR corpus** as the benchmark dataset for the chemical-induced disease relation extraction task. They describe it as consisting of 1500 PubMed abstracts, with a clear breakdown of the training, development, and test sets.

I will also check the **Appendix** for any additional details about the dataset, including how it was annotated and its relevance to the study. The appendix confirms that the BC5CDR corpus is indeed the dataset used, providing further context about its structure and the nature of the annotations.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the dataset from the **References section**. The citation for the BC5CDR corpus is:

- For **BC5CDR corpus**:
  > Jiao Li, Yueping Sun, Robin J. Johnson, Daniela Sciaky, Chih-Hsuan Wei, Robert Leaman, Allan Peter Davis, Carolyn J. Mattingly, Thomas C. Wiegers, and Zhiyong Lu. *BioCreative V CDR task corpus: a resource for chemical disease relation extraction*. Database 2016:baw068.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the required structure.

In summary, the steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction to identify potential datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section to find explicit mentions of datasets.
3. Confirm details in the appendix regarding the dataset's structure and annotations.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into the required format for further processing.
