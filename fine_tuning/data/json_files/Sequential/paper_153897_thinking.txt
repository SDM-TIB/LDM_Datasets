To extract datasets from the research paper titled "P-SIF: Document Embeddings Using Partition Averaging" by Vivek Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed method, which suggests that datasets were used for evaluation. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. This section typically contains information about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors discuss their findings based on the datasets used. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or their characteristics, as these often provide concise information about the datasets employed in the study.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if the authors reference any datasets that are commonly used in the field, which might not be explicitly detailed in the experiments section.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile a list of datasets, including:

1. **SemEval Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of semantic textual similarity tasks. I will note its details and citation.
   - Citation: Agirre, E., Diab, M., Cer, D., & Gonzalez-Agirre, A. (2012). *Semeval-2012 task 6*. In Semeval, 385–393. ACL.

2. **PPDB Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a source for training word vectors.
   - Citation: Ganitkevitch, J., Van Durme, B., & Callison-Burch, C. (2013). *PPDB: The Paraphrase Database*. In NAACL, 758–764.

3. **PARAGRAM-SL999 Dataset**: Used for word embeddings in the experiments.
   - Citation: Wieting, J., Bansal, M., Gimpel, K., Livescu, K., & Roth, D. (2015). *From Paraphrase Database to Compositional Paraphrase Model and Back*. TACL, 3, 345–358.

4. **20NewsGroup Dataset**: Mentioned for multi-class classification experiments.
   - Citation: (No specific citation provided in the text, but it is a well-known dataset in text classification).

5. **Reuters-21578 Dataset**: Used for multi-label classification experiments.
   - Citation: (No specific citation provided in the text, but it is a standard dataset in text classification).

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
