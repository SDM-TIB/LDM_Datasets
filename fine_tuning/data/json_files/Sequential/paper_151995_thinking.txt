To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTM: A Search Space Odyssey" by Klaus Greff et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Evaluation Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe three datasets:

1. **TIMIT Speech Corpus**: This dataset is used for acoustic modeling in speech recognition. The authors mention that it contains a sufficient number of sequences for their study, specifically detailing the training, validation, and test splits.

2. **IAM Online Handwriting Database**: This dataset consists of English sentences represented as time series of pen movements. The authors provide details about the number of boards and the structure of the data.

3. **JSB Chorales**: This dataset includes a collection of harmonized chorales by J. S. Bach, and the authors describe how it is used for next-step prediction tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **TIMIT Speech Corpus**, the citation is:
  > JS Garofolo, LF Lamel, WM Fisher, JG Fiscus, DS Pallett, and NL Dahlgren. *DARPA TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus CD-ROM*. National Institute of Standards and Technology, NTIS Order No PB91-505065, 1993.

- For the **IAM Online Handwriting Database**, the citation is:
  > Marcus Liwicki and Horst Bunke. *IAM-OnDB-an online English sentence database acquired from handwritten text on a whiteboard*. In Document Analysis and Recognition, 2005. Proceedings. Eighth International Conference on, pages 956â€“961. IEEE, 2005.

- For the **JSB Chorales**, the citation is:
  > Nicolas Boulanger-Lewandowski, Yoshua Bengio, and Pascal Vincent. *Modeling Temporal Dependencies in High-Dimensional Sequences: Application to Polyphonic Music Generation and Transcription*. In Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the study along with their proper citations.
