To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Regularization Advantages of Multilingual Neural Language Models for Low Resource Domains" by Navid Rekabsaz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of a multilingual language model on conversational data for low-resource languages, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors describe the data and settings used for their evaluations. They mention using conversational data from four low-resource languages: **Creole, Swahili, Tagalog, and Turkish**. This indicates that these languages are associated with specific datasets.

In section 3.1, the authors specify that the conversational data for these languages is taken from language packs released within the **IARPA Babel program** (Gales et al., 2014). This is a crucial piece of information as it points to a specific dataset source.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the IARPA Babel program, which is essential for documenting the dataset properly. The citation for the Babel project is:

- Gales, M. J. F., Knill, K. M., Ragni, A., & Rath, S. P. (2014). Speech recognition and keyword spotting for low-resource languages: Babel project research at CUED. In *Spoken Language Technologies for Under-Resourced Languages*.

Additionally, I will note the specific languages associated with the dataset:

1. **Creole**: Conversational data from the IARPA Babel program.
2. **Swahili**: Conversational data from the IARPA Babel program.
3. **Tagalog**: Conversational data from the IARPA Babel program.
4. **Turkish**: Conversational data from the IARPA Babel program.

Since all four languages are derived from the same source, I will document them under a single dataset entry but specify the languages involved.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the IARPA Babel program as part of the dataset documentation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly referenced and can be easily located by others.

After completing these steps, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
