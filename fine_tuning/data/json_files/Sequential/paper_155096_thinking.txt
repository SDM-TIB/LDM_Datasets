To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An LSTM-based Plagiarism Detection via Attention Mechanism and a Population-based Approach for Pre-Training Parameters with Imbalanced Classes" by Seyed Vahid Moravvej et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but the introduction is likely to contain more detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they evaluate their proposed model on three benchmark datasets for plagiarism detection. This indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **SemEval2014 Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge (SICK) dataset and contains 5,000 pairs of sentences for training and 5,000 for testing, with similarity labels ranging from 1 to 5.

2. **STS Dataset**: The Semantic Text Similarity (STS) dataset includes 6,928 sentences for training and 1,500 for testing, focusing on image captions, news headlines, and user forums.

3. **MSRP Dataset**: The Microsoft Research Paraphrase corpus (MSRP) consists of 4,076 pairs of sentences for training and 1,725 pairs for testing, with human-annotated tags indicating paraphrasing.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are:

- For **SemEval2014 Dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
