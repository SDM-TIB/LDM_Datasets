To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transferable Energy Storage Bidder" by Yousuf Baker et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of historical prices from New York State and Queensland, Australia, indicating that these datasets are likely used for testing the proposed approach.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** to identify specific datasets. In the **case study setups**, the authors mention using price data from the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) for four price zones: NYC (Zone J), LONGIL (Zone K), NORTH (Zone D), and WEST (Zone A). They also mention using data from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) for Queensland.

I will now look for specific details about these datasets, including the time periods covered and any relevant statistics. The paper states that the NYISO data includes 8760 day-ahead price data points (hourly resolution) and 105,120 real-time price points (5-minute resolution) for the years 2017 to 2019. For Queensland, the authors used selected data from 2019 for training and the first six months of 2021 for evaluation.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) Price Data**:
   > "Energy market & operational data." [Online]. Available: https://www.nyiso.com/energy-market-operational-data

2. **Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) Price Data**:
   > "Engineering precinct battery." [Online]. Available: http://dashboards.sustainability.uq.edu.au/engineering-precinct-battery/interactive/#/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for proper attribution.
