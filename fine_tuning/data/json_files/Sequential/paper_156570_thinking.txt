To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Electrical Load Forecasting Model Using Hybrid LSTM Neural Networks with Online Correction" by Nan Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the importance of accurate electrical load forecasting, but it does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the significance of forecasting in power systems but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Problem Statement)**, where the authors explicitly mention three publicly available datasets used for their experiments: the electrical load data from Belgium, Denmark, and Norway. This section provides crucial information about the datasets, including their time frame and usage.

The datasets are described as follows:
1. **Belgium Load Dataset**: Contains hourly electrical load data from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2021.
2. **Denmark Load Dataset**: Contains hourly electrical load data from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2021.
3. **Norway Load Dataset**: Contains hourly electrical load data from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2021.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and testing their forecasting model, which further validates their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Belgium Load Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Elia. Total Belgian grid load on [Online]. Available: https://opendata.elia.be/explore/dataset/ods001/information

- For the **Denmark Load Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Energinet. Production and consumption - settlement. [Online]. Available: https://www.energidataservice.dk/tso-electricity/ProductionConsumptionSettlement

- For the **Norway Load Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Statnett. Data from the power system. [Online]. Available: https://www.statnett.no/en/for-stakeholders-in-the-power-industry/data-from-the-power-system

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details regarding the datasets used in the research.
