To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecasting Across Time Series Databases using Recurrent Neural Networks on Groups of Similar Series: A Clustering Approach" by Kasun Bandaraa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions that the methodology is assessed using "benchmarking datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental study)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **CIF2016 Dataset**: This dataset consists of monthly time series related to the banking industry and artificially generated series. The authors note that it includes 72 time series for forecasting, which were part of a competition.

2. **NN5 Dataset**: This dataset contains daily cash withdrawals from various ATMs in the UK, comprising 111 time series. The authors indicate that participants were asked to forecast for a prediction horizon of 56 days ahead.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **CIF2016 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > ˇStˇepniˇcka, M., Burda, M. (2016). Computational intelligence in forecasting (CIF) 2016 time series forecasting competition. In: IEEE WCCI 2016, JCNN-13 Advances in Computational Intelligence for Applied Time Series Forecasting (ACIATSF).

- For the **NN5 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Crone, S. F. (2008). NN5 competition. http://www.neural-forecasting-competition.com/NN5/, accessed: 2017-8-18.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CIF2016 Dataset**: A collection of 72 monthly time series related to the banking industry and artificially generated series.
   - Citation: ˇStˇepniˇcka, M., Burda, M. (2016). Computational intelligence in forecasting (CIF) 2016 time series forecasting competition. In: IEEE WCCI 2016, JCNN-13 Advances in Computational Intelligence for Applied Time Series Forecasting (ACIATSF).

2. **NN5 Dataset**: A dataset containing 111 daily cash withdrawals from ATMs in the UK, used for forecasting.
   - Citation: Crone, S. F. (2008). NN5 competition. http://www.neural-forecasting-competition.com/NN5/, accessed: 2017-8-18.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries for further processing or review.
