To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequential Recommender via Time-aware Attentive Memory Network" by Keqiang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two types of datasets: rating datasets and transaction datasets. The specific datasets mentioned are:

1. **MovieLens-25m**: This dataset is described as a widely used benchmark for evaluating collaborative filtering algorithms, containing 25 million user ratings.

2. **Amazon**: The authors specify that they used three categories from the Amazon dataset: Electronics, CDs & Vinyl, and Movies & TV. This dataset is popular for evaluating recommendation algorithms.

3. **Yoochoose**: This dataset is from the RecSys’15 Challenge and contains click-stream data gathered from an e-commerce website over six months. The authors mention that they sampled 1/4 of the users due to the dataset's size.

4. **Ali Mobile**: This dataset contains transaction data gathered from Alibaba’s M-Commerce platform over one month.

In the same section, the authors provide statistics about these datasets, which helps confirm their relevance and usage in the experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MovieLens-25m**, the citation is:
  > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens Datasets*. https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/.

- For **Amazon**, the citation is:
  > Jianmo Ni. *Amazon Product Review Dataset*. http://deepyeti.ucsd.edu/jianmo/amazon/index.html.

- For **Yoochoose**, the citation is:
  > RecSys Challenge. *Yoochoose Dataset*. http://2015.recsyschallenge.com/challenge.html.

- For **Ali Mobile**, the citation is:
  > Alibaba. *Ali Mobile Dataset*. https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=46.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
