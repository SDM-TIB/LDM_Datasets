To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Co-occurrence Feature Learning for Skeleton based Action Recognition using Regularized Deep LSTM Networks" by Wentao Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their model on three human action recognition datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in **section 4**, where they explicitly mention the datasets used for validation.

Upon examining **section 4 (Experiments)**, I find that the authors validate their model on the following datasets:

1. **SBU Kinect Interaction Dataset**: This dataset contains 230 sequences of 8 classes with a total of 6,614 frames. It is specifically designed for recognizing human activities captured by a Kinect device.

2. **HDM05 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,337 skeleton sequences performed by 5 actors, totaling 184,046 frames after down-sampling. It is used for action recognition with a focus on human motion.

3. **CMU Dataset**: This dataset is categorized into 45 classes and contains 2,235 sequences with 987,341 frames after down-sampling. It is noted for its complexity due to varying sequence lengths and within-class diversity.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For the **SBU Kinect Interaction Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yun, K., Honorio, J., Chattopadhyay, D., Berg, T. L., & Samaras, D. (2012). Two-person interaction detection using body pose features and multiple instance learning. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, 28–35.

- For the **HDM05 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Müller, M., Röder, T., Clausen, M., Eberhardt, B., Krüger, B., & Weber, A. (2007). Documentation mocap database HDM05. Technical Report CG-2007-2, Universität Bonn.

- For the **CMU Dataset**, the citation is:
  > CMU. (2003). CMU graphics lab motion capture database. Retrieved from http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/.

With this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
