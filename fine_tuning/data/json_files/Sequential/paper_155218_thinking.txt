To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image-free multi-character recognition" by Huayi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of multi-target recognition and mention the use of a novel image-free sensing technique. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections**. Here, the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets they used. In the text, they specifically mention the **Chinese City Parking Dataset (CCPD)**, which is crucial for their experiments. They provide details about the dataset, including its size (approximately 260,000 images) and the conditions under which the images were captured (various lighting, angles, and weather conditions).

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results or discussion sections**. The authors reference the performance of their model on the CCPD dataset, but they do not mention any other datasets explicitly.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CCPD dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Xu, Z., et al. *Towards end-to-end license plate detection and recognition: A large dataset and baseline*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 255â€“271, 2018.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the CCPD dataset for their experiments, I will create an entry for this dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be ready for any structured output or further processing.
