To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining Generative and Discriminative Neural Networks for Sleep Stages Classification" by Endang Purnama Giri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions that the authors used two datasets: one is an open dataset treated as a benchmark, and the other is their own sleep stages dataset. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors are likely to provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. I will look for specific names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how these datasets were used in their experiments.

In the paper, the authors refer to the first dataset as the **benchmark dataset**, which consists of five-night sleep recordings. They describe the methodology for using this dataset, including the leave-one-out cross-validation technique. The second dataset is referred to as the **MKG dataset**, which consists of ten-night sleep recordings. The authors also detail how they processed this dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The benchmark dataset is likely a well-known dataset in the field, while the MKG dataset may be a novel contribution from the authors. 

For the **benchmark dataset**, I will look for a citation that corresponds to a widely recognized sleep dataset, such as the Sleep-EDF dataset or a similar resource. For the **MKG dataset**, since it is mentioned as their own dataset, I will note that it is available for download, but it may not have a formal citation yet.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the benchmark dataset and a note about the MKG dataset being a novel contribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
