To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Collaborative Filtering with Recurrent Neural Networks" by Robin Devooght and Hugues Bersini, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction elaborates on the context and significance of the study. I will pay special attention to any specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Movielens 1M**: This dataset is described as a smaller version of the Movielens dataset, containing 6040 users and 1,000,209 ratings across 3706 movies. It includes additional user information such as age, sex, and occupation, as well as movie details like year and genre.

2. **Netflix**: This dataset is significantly larger, comprising approximately 480,000 users and 100 million ratings for 17,770 movies. The authors note that both datasets have been split into training, validation, and test subsets.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Movielens 1M**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The Movielens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):19, 2015.

- For **Netflix**, the citation is:
  > Netflix, Inc. *Netflix Prize Dataset*. [Online]. Available: https://www.netflixprize.com/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will involve summarizing the key characteristics of each dataset and including the full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary information is included for further processing or review.
