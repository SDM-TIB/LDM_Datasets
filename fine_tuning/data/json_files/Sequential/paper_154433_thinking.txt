To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MiniRocket: A Very Fast (Almost) Deterministic Transform for Time Series Classification" by Angus Dempster et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that MiniRocket can train and test a classifier on **all 109 datasets from the UCR archive**. This indicates that the UCR archive is a significant dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** (Section 4). In Section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate MiniRocket on the datasets in the UCR archive, which consists of **109 datasets**. This is a clear indication that the UCR archive is the primary source of datasets for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the UCR archive, as it is crucial to provide proper attribution. The relevant citation for the UCR Time Series Archive is:

- **UCR Time Series Archive**:
  > Hoang An Dau, Anthony Bagnall, Kaveh Kamgar, Chin-Chia Michael Yeh, Yan Zhu, Shaghayegh Gharghabi, Chotirat Ann Ratanamahatana, and Eamonn Keogh. *The UCR Time Series Archive*. IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica 6, 6 (2019), 1293â€“1305.

Since the paper does not specify individual datasets from the UCR archive, I will summarize the dataset as a single entry, noting that it encompasses all 109 datasets.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the UCR archive as required. This will allow for proper documentation and reference in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
