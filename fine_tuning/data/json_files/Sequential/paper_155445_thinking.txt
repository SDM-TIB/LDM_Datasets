To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accurate Non-Stationary Short-Term Traffic Flow Prediction Method" by Wenzheng Zhao, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on a UK public highway traffic flow dataset, which indicates that a dataset is indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the author explicitly states: "We conduct experiments on the British Highways dataset [41]." This is a clear identification of the dataset used for the experiments.

In the **dataset description**, the author provides details about the British Highways dataset, including its collection frequency and the specific subset used for the experiments (the M25 motorway near Heathrow Airport). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the British Highways dataset. The citation is provided as follows:
> Highways England, "Highways England network traffic flow data," [EB/OL], https://tris.highwaysengland.co.uk/detail/trafﬁcﬂowdata, Retrieved September, 2019.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **British Highways Dataset**: This dataset contains traffic flow data collected from various highways in the UK, with a collection frequency of 15 minutes. The specific subset used in the experiments focuses on the M25 motorway near Heathrow Airport.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details about the dataset are captured accurately.
