To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building a Kannada POS Tagger Using Machine Learning and Neural Network Models" by Ketan Kumar Todi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and corpus details sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper focuses on developing a POS tagger for Kannada, which suggests that a dataset is likely involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Corpus Details)**, where the authors describe the corpus used for their experiments. They mention that the corpus is publicly available and funded by the Government of India, which is a good indication that it is a formal dataset. The authors provide specific details about the corpus, including its size and the domains it covers. They mention that the corpus contains sentences from three different domains, with a total of 13.1K sentences and 149K tokens.

In this section, they also provide a breakdown of the train/test split, which is crucial for understanding how the dataset was utilized in their experiments. The train/test split indicates that the dataset is structured and ready for use in machine learning tasks.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the corpus as being available at a specific URL: "http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/showfile.php?filename=downloads/kolhi/". However, I need to ensure that I provide a proper citation for the dataset.

The citation for the dataset based on the information provided in the paper is:
> "Kannada Corpus". Funded by DeiTY, Govt. of India. Available at: http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/showfile.php?filename=downloads/kolhi/

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the relevant sections of the paper to identify datasets.
2. Extract details about the Kannada corpus used for POS tagging.
3. Locate the citation for the dataset and ensure it is complete.

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entry for the Kannada corpus.
