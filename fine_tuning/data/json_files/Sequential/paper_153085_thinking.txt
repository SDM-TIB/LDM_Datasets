To extract datasets from the research paper titled "testRNN: Coverage-guided Testing on Recurrent Neural Networks" by Wei Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the tool and its applications, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses the need for validation techniques for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and mentions the use of LSTM networks, but again, no specific datasets are referenced.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors describe their testing methodology. Here, they mention using a simple LSTM model trained on the **MNIST dataset** for handwritten digit recognition. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in their experiments.

I will then check the **usage example** section (Section IV) to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned. However, it primarily focuses on the command line options for the testRNN tool and does not introduce new datasets.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is typically standardized. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:

- **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MNIST dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
