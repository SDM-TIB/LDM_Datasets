To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lithium-ion Battery State of Health Estimation based on Cycle Synchronization using Dynamic Time Warping" by Kate Qi Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of state of health (SOH) estimation for lithium-ion batteries, which suggests that there may be datasets related to battery performance.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the degradation of lithium-ion batteries and mention that they will be using data-driven methods for SOH estimation. This indicates that there may be specific datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their experiments. They mention using data from the NASA Ames Prognostics Data Repository, specifically referencing Battery 18, which is crucial for identifying the dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors provide details about the experiments conducted using the dataset, including the number of discharge cycles and the characteristics of the data collected (e.g., temperature, current, voltage). This reinforces the importance of the dataset in their analysis.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **NASA Battery Dataset**: The paper specifically mentions using the Battery 18 dataset from the NASA Ames Prognostics Data Repository. This dataset includes discharge cycles and various measurements (temperature, current, voltage) over time.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the NASA Battery Dataset is:

- For the **NASA Battery Dataset**, the citation is:
  > B. Saha and K. Goebel, “Battery data set,” NASA Ames Prognostics Data Repository (http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/project/prognostic-data-repository), NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, 2007.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to create structured entries for the dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
