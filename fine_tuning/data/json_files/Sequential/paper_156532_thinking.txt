To extract datasets from the research paper titled "REALM: RAG-Driven Enhancement of Multimodal Electronic Health Records Analysis via Large Language Models" by Yinghao Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setups sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of **MIMIC-III** for experiments, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setups section** where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly state that the **MIMIC-III dataset** is sourced from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and is widely used in healthcare research. They describe how they preprocess the time-series data and clinical notes extracted from this dataset.

In addition to MIMIC-III, the authors mention the use of **PrimeKG**, a knowledge graph that integrates various medical resources. While PrimeKG is not a dataset in the traditional sense, it is crucial for the framework's functionality and should be noted.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: The citation is not explicitly provided in the text, but it is commonly referenced in the literature as:
   > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Lehman, L. W. C., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M. M., ... & Mark, R. G. (2016). MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data*, 3, 160035.

2. **PrimeKG**: The citation for PrimeKG is:
   > Chandak, P., Huang, K., & Zitnik, M. (2023). Building a knowledge graph to enable precision medicine. *Scientific Data*, 10(1), 67.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations for future reference.
