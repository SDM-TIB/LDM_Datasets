To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QUANTILE-LSTM: A ROBUST LSTM FOR ANOMALY DETECTION IN TIME SERIES DATA" by Snehanshu Saha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the algorithms have been tested on "multiple industrial time-series datasets such as Yahoo, AWS, GE, and machine sensors." This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will look at **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for a list or description of the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

Upon reviewing section 4.1, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Yahoo Datasets**: The paper refers to multiple Yahoo datasets (Yahoo Dataset1 to Yahoo Dataset9) used for anomaly detection.
2. **AWS Datasets**: Similarly, there are AWS datasets (AWS Dataset1 to AWS Dataset3 and their synthetic versions).
3. **GE Datasets**: The authors also mention GE Dataset1 and GE Dataset2.
4. **Machine Temperature Dataset**: This dataset is also referenced as part of the experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- **Yahoo Datasets**: 
  > Yahoo Webscope. *Yahoo Webscope Dataset*. Available at: https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/

- **AWS Datasets**: 
  > AWS CloudWatch. *AWS CloudWatch Dataset*. Available at: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/

- **GE Datasets**: 
  > GE. *GE Industrial Datasets*. Available at: https://www.ge.com/

- **Machine Temperature Dataset**: 
  > Numenta. *Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) Dataset*. Available at: https://github.com/numenta/NAB/tree/master/data

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and facilitate further exploration or replication of the study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and use in future analyses or applications.
