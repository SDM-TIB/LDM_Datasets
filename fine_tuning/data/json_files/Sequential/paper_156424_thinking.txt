To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Co-learning synaptic delays, weights and adaptation in spiking neural networks" by Lucas Deckers et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their model's performance on various speech recognition datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any specific dataset names or descriptions. The introduction discusses the advantages of spiking neural networks (SNNs) but does not provide specific dataset details.

I will then focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD)**: This dataset consists of German and English spoken digits (0 through 9) converted into spikes across 700 input channels.

2. **Spiking Speech Commands (SSC)**: This dataset is based on sounds from the Google Speech Commands dataset, also converted into spikes and containing 35 classes from various speakers in a non-controlled environment.

3. **Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC)**: This dataset consists of speech samples and is used for limited-vocabulary speech recognition.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these three datasets were utilized for their evaluations, reinforcing their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Benjamin Cramer, Yannik Stradmann, Johannes Schemmel, and Friedemann Zenke. *The Heidelberg Spiking Data Sets for the Systematic Evaluation of Spiking Neural Networks*. IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 33(7):2744–2757, 2020.

- For the **Spiking Speech Commands (SSC)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Benjamin Cramer, Yannik Stradmann, Johannes Schemmel, and Friedemann Zenke. *The Heidelberg Spiking Data Sets for the Systematic Evaluation of Spiking Neural Networks*. IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 33(7):2744–2757, 2020. (Note: This dataset is derived from the GSC dataset, but the authors reference it as a separate dataset.)

- For the **Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Pete Warden. *Speech Commands: A Dataset for Limited-Vocabulary Speech Recognition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.03209, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
