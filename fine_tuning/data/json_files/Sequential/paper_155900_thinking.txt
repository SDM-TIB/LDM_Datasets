To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural-Symbolic Inference for Robust Autoregressive Graph Parsing via Compositional Uncertainty Quantification" by Zi Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors empirically investigate their approach on a diverse suite of standard in-domain and seven out-of-distribution (OOD) corpora, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention that they trained the neural model on the **DeepBank v1.1** annotation of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and selected seven diverse datasets from the Redwoods Treebank corpus for OOD evaluation. 

The specific datasets mentioned are:

1. **DeepBank v1.1**: This dataset consists of annotations from the Wall Street Journal, specifically sections 00-21, which correspond to the ERG version 1214.

2. **Wikipedia (Wiki)**: A treebank constructed for 100 Wikipedia articles on Computational Linguistics, comprising 11,558 sentences.

3. **Brown Corpus**: A carefully compiled selection of current American English, totaling about a million words drawn from various sources.

4. **Eric Raymond Essay (Essay)**: Based on translations of the essay “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” by Eric Raymond, featuring higher linguistic complexity.

5. **E-commerce**: A corpus of training and test data constructed from email messages for automated responses to customer inquiries.

6. **Verbmobil**: A collection of transcriptions of spoken dialogues reflecting negotiations for scheduling meetings or hotel stays.

7. **LOGON**: A corpus acquired from Norwegian tourism brochures originally written in Norwegian and translated into English.

8. **Tanaka Corpus**: A treebank based on parallel Japanese-English sentences used with the WWWJDIC dictionary server.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper or from known sources:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
