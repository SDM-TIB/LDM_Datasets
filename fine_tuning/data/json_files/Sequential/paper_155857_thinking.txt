To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Representation of Oil Wells’ Intervals via Sparse Attention Mechanism" by Alina Ermilova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their models using an "industry-scale open dataset consisting of well logs of more than 20 wells." This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Methods)**, specifically the **subsection A (Data Overview)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that they are using an open access dataset provided by the New Zealand Petroleum & Minerals Online Exploration Database and the Petlab, which consists of wells from the Taranaki basin, New Zealand. This is a crucial piece of information.

The authors specify that they consider intervals from wells of length 100 measurements or 33 ft, and they use four features: porosity inferred from density log (DRHO), density log (DENS), gamma-ray (GR), and sonic log (DTC). This detailed description helps in understanding the dataset's structure and content.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

1. For the **New Zealand Petroleum & Minerals Online Exploration Database**:
   > New Zealand Petroleum & Minerals. "The New Zealand petroleum & minerals online exploration database." 2015. Last accessed August 23, 2021. Available: https://data.nzpam.govt.nz/GOLD/system/mainframe.asp

2. For **Petlab**:
   > G. Science. "Petlab: New Zealand’s national rock, mineral and geoanalytical database." 2004. Last accessed August 23, 2021. Available: http://pet.gns.cri.nz/

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
