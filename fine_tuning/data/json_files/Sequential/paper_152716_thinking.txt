To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Massively Multilingual Sentence Embeddings for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer and Beyond" by Mikel Artetxe and Holger Schwenk, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on the **XNLI dataset**, **MLDoc dataset**, and **BUCC dataset**, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to find detailed descriptions of these datasets. In section 4.1, the authors describe the **XNLI dataset** as a cross-lingual natural language inference dataset consisting of 2,500 development and 5,000 test instances translated from English into 14 languages. This dataset is essential for evaluating the performance of multilingual sentence embeddings.

In section 4.2, the **MLDoc dataset** is mentioned as a cross-lingual document classification dataset, which includes 1,000 training and development documents and 4,000 test documents across four different genres. This dataset is used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method in document classification tasks.

In section 4.3, the **BUCC dataset** is discussed in the context of bitext mining, where the authors explain that it consists of comparable corpora in different languages, specifically focusing on extracting parallel sentences. The dataset includes a substantial number of sentences for each language pair.

Additionally, the authors introduce a new test set based on the **Tatoeba corpus** for multilingual similarity search, which covers 112 languages. This dataset is constructed from aligned sentences and is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed embeddings across various languages.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

4. **Tatoeba Dataset**:

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This will ensure that all relevant datasets are documented accurately and comprehensively.
