To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comprehensive Exploration on WikiSQL with Table-Aware Word Contextualization" by Wonseok Hwang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the **WikiSQL dataset**, which is a significant clue that this dataset is central to the research. The introduction further elaborates on WikiSQL, describing it as a large-scale dataset consisting of 80,654 natural language utterances and corresponding SQL annotations on 24,241 tables extracted from Wikipedia.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors discuss the WikiSQL dataset in detail, confirming its use for training and evaluation of their model. They also provide insights into the dataset's structure and its significance in the context of their research.

Now, I will gather the necessary details about the dataset:

1. **WikiSQL Dataset**: This dataset is explicitly mentioned throughout the paper. It is characterized as a large semantic parsing dataset that has been pivotal in advancing the field of natural language to SQL translation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WikiSQL dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **WikiSQL**, the citation is:
  > Victor Zhong, Caiming Xiong, and Richard Socher. *Seq2SQL: Generating Structured Queries from Natural Language Using Reinforcement Learning*. CoRR, abs/1709.00103, 2017.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset's name, description, and citation. This will allow me to present a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure, ensuring that the dataset entry is ready for review or further processing.
