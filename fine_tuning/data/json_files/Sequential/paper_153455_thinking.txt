To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Graph Convolutional Network for Skeleton-based Human Action Recognition by Neural Searching" by Wei Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "two very large scaled datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention:

1. **NTU RGB+D Dataset**: This dataset is described as the largest multi-modality indoor-captured action recognition dataset, containing RGB videos, depth sequences, infrared videos, and 3D skeleton data. It includes 56,880 video clips covering 60 human action classes.

2. **Kinetics-Skeleton Dataset**: This dataset is based on the Kinetics dataset and contains approximately 300,000 video clips collected from YouTube. It includes 400 kinds of human actions, with skeleton data estimated using OpenPose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **NTU RGB+D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shahroudy, A., Liu, J., Ng, T.-T., & Wang, G. (2016). NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 1010â€“1019.

- For the **Kinetics-Skeleton Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kay, W., Carreira, J., Simonyan, K., Zisserman, A., & Green, T. (2017). The kinetics human action video dataset. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **NTU RGB+D Dataset**: A large-scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis, containing RGB videos, depth sequences, infrared videos, and 3D skeleton data, with 56,880 video clips across 60 action classes.

2. **Kinetics-Skeleton Dataset**: A dataset derived from the Kinetics dataset, featuring approximately 300,000 video clips of 400 human actions, with skeleton data estimated using OpenPose.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
