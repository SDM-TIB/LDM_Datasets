To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecasting directional movements of stock prices for intraday trading using LSTM and random forests" by Pushpendu Ghosh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyze the effectiveness of their methods on the constituent stocks of the S&P 500 from January 1993 to December 2018. This suggests that the dataset is related to stock prices over this time period.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Data and technology)**, where the authors describe the data sample. They mention that they collected adjusted closing prices and opening prices of all constituent stocks of the S&P 500 from January 1990 until December 2018 using Bloomberg. This is a crucial dataset for their analysis.

In this section, they also specify that stocks with zero volume were not considered for trading on that day, which is important for understanding the dataset's filtering criteria.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset used. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the S&P 500 dataset they used, but they mention that the data was collected from Bloomberg. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is derived from Bloomberg's financial data services.

Since the dataset is based on the S&P 500, I will also include a general citation for the S&P 500 index, which is widely recognized in financial literature. However, the specific dataset used in this paper does not have a formal citation beyond the source of the data (Bloomberg).

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **S&P 500 Dataset**: This dataset includes adjusted closing prices and opening prices of all constituent stocks of the S&P 500 from January 1990 until December 2018. The data was sourced from Bloomberg.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entry with the relevant details, ensuring that I include the source of the data as the citation. This will provide a clear reference for anyone reviewing the datasets used in this research.
