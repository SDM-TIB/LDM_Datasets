To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Effective Representations for Person-Job Fit by Feature Fusion" by Junshu Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the problem being addressed and may mention any datasets used. In this case, the authors discuss using real data collected from their recruitment platform, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using "real data collected by our recruitment platform from January 2019 to October 2019," which indicates that they have a specific dataset they are working with. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of job posts, candidates, and resumes.

I will note the specifics of the dataset:
- The dataset consists of approximately **13,000 job posts**, **580,000 candidates**, and **1.3 million resumes**. Each application is treated as a data sample.

Since the paper does not provide a formal name for the dataset or a citation, I will create a description based on the information provided. However, I will also check the **References section** to see if any related datasets or previous works are cited that could provide context or additional datasets.

In this case, the authors do not cite any specific datasets from other works, nor do they provide a formal citation for their own dataset. Therefore, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Recruitment Platform Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset collected from a recruitment platform containing approximately 13,000 job posts, 580,000 candidates, and 1.3 million resumes, used for studying person-job fit.
- **Citation**: Since this dataset is proprietary and not formally published, I will note that it is derived from the authors' own data collection efforts.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and any relevant citations or notes about the dataset's origin.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
