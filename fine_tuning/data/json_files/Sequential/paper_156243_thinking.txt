To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature Extraction Using Deep Generative Models for Bangla Text Classification on a New Comprehensive Dataset" by Md. Rafi-Ur-Rashid et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected and prepared a comprehensive dataset of **212,184 Bangla documents** in seven different categories, which suggests that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Materials and Methods)**, specifically the **3.1 (Dataset)** subsection, where the authors describe how they collected and annotated the dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of articles from various Bangla news portals and blogs, categorized into seven categories: Government & Politics, Science & Technology, Economics, Health & Lifestyle, Entertainment, Arts & Literature, and Sports. This section provides essential details about the dataset's size and structure.

The authors also mention that five human annotators labeled the articles, which adds credibility to the dataset's quality. They state that the dataset is publicly accessible, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is newly created by the authors and not previously published, it may not have a formal citation in the references. Instead, I will note the authors' statement about the dataset being publicly accessible and include the link provided in the paper.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Bangla Text Dataset**: A comprehensive dataset of **212,184 Bangla documents** categorized into seven categories. The dataset is publicly accessible for future research on Bangla language processing.

Since the dataset is original and created by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
> Md. Rafi-Ur-Rashid, Sami Azam, Mirjam Jonkman. *Feature Extraction Using Deep Generative Models for Bangla Text Classification on a New Comprehensive Dataset*. Available at: https://cutt.ly/SYTV6Pv.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
