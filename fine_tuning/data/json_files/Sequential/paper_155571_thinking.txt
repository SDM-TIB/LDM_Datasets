To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Audio Input Generates Continuous Frames to Synthesize Facial Video Using Generative Adversarial Networks" by Zhang H.H.D., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a method for generating speech videos based on audio, which suggests that datasets are involved in the training process.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they reference the work of A. Duarte et al. to create their own dataset from YouTube videos. This implies that they have constructed a dataset but does not provide specific details yet.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly the subsection titled "Dataset build." Here, the authors describe how they created their dataset by capturing videos from YouTube and processing them to extract audio and corresponding frames. They mention that they group three consecutive frames with 0.1 seconds of audio, but they do not provide a formal name for this dataset.

Since the authors do not provide a specific name for their dataset, I will refer to it as the "YouTube Facial Video Dataset" for the purpose of this extraction. I will also note that the dataset is self-constructed and does not have a formal citation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to see if there are any datasets mentioned that are used in conjunction with their own dataset. The references include works by A. Duarte et al., which is relevant since it serves as a basis for their dataset creation. The citation for this reference is:

- A. Duarte et al. "Wav2Pix: Speech-conditioned Face Generation Using Generative Adversarial Networks," in ICASSP, 2019, pp. 8633-8637.

Since the authors did not provide a formal citation for their own dataset, I will document it as follows:

1. **YouTube Facial Video Dataset**: A self-constructed dataset created by capturing videos from YouTube, extracting audio, and corresponding frames. No formal citation available.

2. **Wav2Pix Dataset** (referenced): 
   > A. Duarte et al. "Wav2Pix: Speech-conditioned Face Generation Using Generative Adversarial Networks," in ICASSP, 2019, pp. 8633-8637.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
