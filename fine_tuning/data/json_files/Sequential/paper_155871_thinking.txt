To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deteksi Depresi dan Kecemasan Pengguna Twitter Menggunakan Bidirectional LSTM" by Kuncahyo Setyo Nugroho et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on detecting depression and anxiety in Twitter users, which suggests that a dataset related to Twitter is likely involved.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their approach to dataset collection. They mention that the dataset consists of **2,751 tweets in Indonesian**, categorized into two labels: label 1 for tweets indicating potential anxiety or depression, and label 0 for those that do not. This section confirms the existence of a dataset and provides key details about its composition.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their model using this dataset, which further emphasizes its importance in the study. They also mention the distribution of the classes within the dataset, indicating an imbalance between the two labels.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- **Depression and Anxiety in Twitter (ID)**: 
  > D. M. R. Rianto, L. P. Wisesa, and S. Hans, “Depression and Anxiety in Twitter (ID),” Kaggle, 2021. https://www.kaggle.com/stevenhans/depression-and-anxiety-in-twitter-id (accessed Nov. 11, 2021).

This citation provides the necessary details to credit the dataset properly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including its description and citation, into the required format for further processing or review. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant details about the dataset used in the research paper.
