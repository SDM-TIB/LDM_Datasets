To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Deep Models for Predicting Affective Responses Evoked by Movies" by Ha Thi Phuong Thao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves predicting affective responses from movie clips, which suggests that there may be a dataset used for this purpose.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the importance of predicting emotions from multimedia content. They reference the **COGNIMUSE dataset**, which is crucial for their experiments. This dataset is likely to be detailed further in the paper.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors provide a thorough description of the **extended COGNIMUSE dataset**. They mention that it consists of 12 movie clips, including seven half-hour continuous clips from the original COGNIMUSE dataset and five additional Hollywood movie clips. The dataset includes annotations for sensory and semantic saliency, events, and emotions, specifically focusing on experienced and intended emotions.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the COGNIMUSE dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **extended COGNIMUSE dataset**:

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Extended COGNIMUSE Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting emotions evoked by movie clips. It includes 12 movie clips, with annotations for arousal and valence values ranging from -1 to 1, based on multiple subjects' ratings.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset details along with their citations, ensuring that all necessary information is included for future reference or analysis.
