To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep multi-stations weather forecasting: explainable recurrent convolutional neural networks" by Ismail Alaoui Abdellaoui and Siamak Mehrkanoon, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses weather forecasting using data from multiple cities, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Data Description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. Here, they mention that the dataset was collected from Weather Underground and includes data from **18 cities across Europe** over a period of **15 years from May 2005 to April 2020**. The dataset comprises **18 weather features** with daily time resolution.

The authors also describe the structure of the dataset, indicating that at each time step, a data sample is represented by a matrix, and the entire dataset is a tensor. This section confirms the existence of a dataset and provides essential details about its composition.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that the dataset is publicly available and provide a link to the GitHub repository where it can be accessed. The citation for the dataset is as follows:

- **Weather Underground Dataset**: 
  > Ismail Alaoui Abdellaoui, Siamak Mehrkanoon. *Deep multi-stations weather forecasting: explainable recurrent convolutional neural networks*. GitHub repository: https://github.com/IsmailAlaouiAbdellaoui/weather-forecasting-explanable-recurrent-convolutional-nn.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset details:

1. **Dataset Name**: Weather Underground Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset containing daily weather data from 18 cities across Europe, spanning 15 years (May 2005 - April 2020). It includes 18 weather features.
   - **Citation**: Ismail Alaoui Abdellaoui, Siamak Mehrkanoon. *Deep multi-stations weather forecasting: explainable recurrent convolutional neural networks*. GitHub repository: https://github.com/IsmailAlaouiAbdellaoui/weather-forecasting-explanable-recurrent-convolutional-nn.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
