To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Device Directedness with Contextual Cues for Spoken Dialog Systems" by Dhanush Bekal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on spoken dialog data, which suggests that there may be specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, section 4.1 (Data) provides detailed information about the dataset they collected for the barge-in classification task.

The authors mention that they collected **12,000 single turn chat-bot prompts and user response pairs** in various environments. They also describe how the data was split into training, validation, and test sets, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

I will note the specifics of the dataset:
- The dataset consists of 12,000 pairs of chat-bot prompts and user responses, with a balanced distribution of true and false barge-in classes.
- The data is collected in diverse environments such as home, car, malls, and streets, which adds to its richness.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset they collected, as it appears to be an in-house dataset created by the authors for their specific research purposes.

Since there are no external datasets cited in the paper, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Custom Barge-in Dataset**: This dataset consists of 12,000 single turn chat-bot prompts and user response pairs, collected in various environments (home, car, malls, streets). The dataset is split into training (9000), validation (1000), and test (2000) sets, with balanced true and false barge-in classes.

Since this dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is an in-house dataset created by the authors.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I include the details about the dataset and its context as described in the paper.
