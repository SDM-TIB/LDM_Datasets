To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ASR-free CNN-DTW keyword spotting using multilingual bottleneck features for almost zero-resource languages" by Raghav Menon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of **1920 isolated keywords** as exemplars for the keyword spotting task, which indicates that there is a dataset involved. The introduction discusses the challenges of keyword spotting in low-resource languages, hinting at the need for specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **Data section** (section 3), where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **Isolated Keywords Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1920 labeled isolated keywords, each spoken twice by 24 South African speakers (12 male and 12 female). This dataset is crucial as it serves as the only transcribed target-domain data for training the keyword spotter.

2. **South African Broadcast News (SABN) Dataset**: This is a 23-hour corpus of untranscribed speech, which includes a mix of English newsreader speech, interviews, and crossings to reporters, broadcast between 1996 and 2006. The SABN dataset is used as untranscribed data to obtain targets for the CNN.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Isolated Keywords Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is derived from the authors' previous work:
  > R. Menon, H. Kamper, J. Quinn, and T. Niesler. "Fast ASR-free and almost zero-resource keyword spotting using DTW and CNNs for humanitarian monitoring." In Proc. Interspeech (accepted), 2018.

- For the **South African Broadcast News (SABN) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Kamper, F. D. Wet, T. Hain, and T. N. Niesler. "Capitalising on North American speech resources for the development of a South African English large vocabulary speech recognition system." Computer Speech and Language, vol. 28, no. 6, pp. 1255â€“1268, 2014.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
