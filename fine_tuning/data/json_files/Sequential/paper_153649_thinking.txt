To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Syntactically Look-Ahead Attention Network for Sentence Compression" by Hidetaka Kamigaito and Manabu Okumura, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluated their method on the **Google sentence compression dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific details about the datasets in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors mention using the **Google sentence compression dataset** and the **Broadcast News Compression Corpus (BNC Corpus)**. I will note down the descriptions provided for each dataset.

In the experiments section, the authors provide details about the **Google sentence compression dataset**, indicating that they used the first 1,000 sentences of `comp-data.eval.json` as the test set and the last 1,000 sentences as the development set. They also mention using all 200,000 sentences in `sent-comp.train*.json` for training.

For the **BNC Corpus**, the authors describe it as containing spoken sentences and their summaries created by three annotators. They specify that they treated sentences longer than the average length as the test set.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Google sentence compression dataset**, the citation is:
   > Filippova, K., and Altun, Y. (2013). Overcoming the lack of parallel data in sentence compression. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 1481–1491.

2. For the **BNC Corpus**, the citation is:
   > Clarke, J., and Lapata, M. (2007). Modelling compression with discourse constraints. In Proceedings of the 2007 Joint Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning (EMNLP-CoNLL), 1–11.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Google sentence compression dataset**: A dataset used for evaluating sentence compression models, consisting of 200,000 training sentences, 1,000 development sentences, and 1,000 test sentences.
- **BNC Corpus**: A dataset containing spoken sentences and their summaries, used for evaluating compression performance on long sentences.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately captured for future reference or processing.
