To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Emotion Detection in Text: Focusing on Latent Representation" by Armin Seyeditabari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a new network for emotion detection and indicates that the authors achieved significant improvements on their test data and a new dataset. This suggests that there are datasets involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the complexity of emotion detection in text and reference various emotional models. However, I need to find specific datasets mentioned for their experiments.

In the **experiment section**, the authors compare their approach to two datasets:
1. **Wang et al. (2012) Tweet Dataset**: This dataset consists of over 2 million tweets labeled with emotional hashtags. The authors describe how they processed this dataset and its significance in their experiments.
2. **CrowdFlower Dataset**: This dataset contains 40,000 tweets annotated via crowd-sourcing, each with a single emotional label. The authors provide details on how they mapped the labels from this dataset to their emotional categories.

I will now look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Wang et al. (2012) Tweet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, W.; Chen, L.; Thirunarayan, K.; and Sheth, A. P. 2012. *Harnessing twitter "big data" for automatic emotion identification*. In Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust (PASSAT), 2012 International Conference on and 2012 International Conference on Social Computing (SocialCom), 587–592. IEEE.

- For the **CrowdFlower Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bostan, L. A. M., and Klinger, R. 2018. *An analysis of annotated corpora for emotion classification in text*. In Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, 2104–2119.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
