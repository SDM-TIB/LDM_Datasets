To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Attention Long Short-Term Memory based system for automatic classification of speech intelligibility" by Miguel Fernández-Díaz and Ascensión Gallardo-Antolín, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their models using the **UA-Speech database**, which is a strong indication that this is a key dataset for their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. They describe the **UA-Speech database** as consisting of audio files from 15 individuals with dysarthria and 13 healthy controls, recorded under specific conditions. This section confirms that the UA-Speech database is indeed the dataset utilized for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the UA-Speech database. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- **UA-Speech Database**: 
  > Kim, H., Hasegawa-Johnson, M., Perlman, A., Gunderson, J., Huang, T.S., Watkin, K., Frame, S. (2008). Dysarthric speech database for universal access research. In Proceedings of the 9th Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association (INTERSPEECH), pp. 1741–1744.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure, ensuring that the citation is included in full.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
