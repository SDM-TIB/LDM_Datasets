To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Highly Accurate and Reliable Wireless Network Slicing in 5th Generation Networks: A Hybrid Deep Learning Approach" by Sulaiman Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of network slicing in 5G networks but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where they describe the hybrid deep learning model and its application.

In **section 5 (Research Methodology)**, the authors mention that the proposed model is trained using a dataset consisting of **65,000 unique entries**. This dataset includes key performance indicators (KPIs) regarding network and devices, such as device types (IoT-based devices, smartphones, etc.), user equipment (UE) categories, packet loss, QoS class identifiers, and more. However, they do not provide a formal name for this dataset.

Next, I will check the **results and discussions section** to see if the dataset is referenced again or if any additional datasets are mentioned. The authors discuss the performance of their model and the accuracy achieved, but they do not introduce any new datasets.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find any citations related to the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset they used, which is a common practice in research papers. However, they do reference other works that may have used similar datasets or methodologies.

Since the paper does not provide a formal name or citation for the dataset used, I will note that the dataset is described but lacks a specific citation. I will summarize the dataset as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Not explicitly named in the paper.
- **Description**: The dataset consists of 65,000 unique entries, including KPIs for various device types, user equipment categories, packet loss rates, QoS class identifiers, and other relevant information for network slicing in 5G networks.

Since there is no formal citation provided for this dataset, I will indicate that it is based on the authors' description in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format for review or further processing.
