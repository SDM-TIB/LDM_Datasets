To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Natural Language Inference with LSTM" by Shuohang Wang and Jing Jiang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus**, which indicates that this is a dataset of interest. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the SNLI corpus in detail. They mention that it contains around **570K sentence pairs** with three labels: entailment, contradiction, and neutral. This confirms that the SNLI corpus is a significant dataset used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide further details about the dataset. They state that they discard pairs labeled with a lack of consensus, resulting in **549,367 pairs for training, 9,842 pairs for development, and 9,824 pairs for testing**. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and usage.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the SNLI corpus. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus**, the citation is:
  > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.

Since the SNLI corpus is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, I have identified the **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus** as the primary dataset used in the research, and I have retrieved its full citation. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for any further analysis or documentation.
