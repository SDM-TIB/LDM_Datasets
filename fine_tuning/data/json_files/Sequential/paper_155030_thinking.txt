To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On-Device Neural Speech Synthesis" by Sivanand Achanta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but the experiments section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the advancements in text-to-speech synthesis but do not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experiments section** where they describe the data used for their experiments.

In **section 5.1 (Data)**, the authors explicitly state that they used two internal datasets for their experiments: 

1. **American English Female Dataset (en-US Female)**: This dataset contains 36 hours of audio sampled at 24 kHz.
2. **American English Male Dataset (en-US Male)**: This dataset contains 22 hours of audio, also sampled at 24 kHz.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to these datasets. However, since these datasets are described as "internal datasets," they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. In this case, I will note that they are internal datasets without external citations.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly describe each dataset and include any relevant details such as the duration of audio and sampling rate.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary information and citations, even if they are not formally published.
