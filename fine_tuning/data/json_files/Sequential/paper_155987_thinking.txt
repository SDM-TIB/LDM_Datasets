To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing the Generalizability of Deep Contextualized Language Representations for Text Classification" by Berfu Büyüköz, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the study evaluates the robustness of two deep contextual language representations, ELMo and DistilBERT, on tasks involving binary protest news classification and sentiment analysis of product reviews. This indicates that there are datasets related to these tasks.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Data)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the author specifies two distinct datasets:

1. **Protest News Data**: This dataset consists of local news articles from India and China, specifically annotated to identify whether they pertain to protest events. The data is sourced from the CLEF-2019 Lab ProtestNews, which is a shared task focused on extracting protests from news articles.

2. **Sentiment Analysis Data**: This dataset includes movie reviews and customer reviews, which are annotated as positive or negative. The movie reviews are commonly used in sentiment analysis tasks, while the customer reviews provide a different context for evaluation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:

- For the **Protest News Data**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
