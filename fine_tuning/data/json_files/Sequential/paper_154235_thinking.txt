To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey of Knowledge-Enhanced Text Generation" by Wenhao Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction and subsequent sections are likely to contain specific references to datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Benchmarks, Toolkit, and Leaderboard Performance)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the context of knowledge-enhanced text generation. I will look for any tables or lists that summarize the datasets, their purposes, and any relevant metrics.

In this section, I find several datasets mentioned, including:

1. **Wizard of Wikipedia**: An open-domain dialogue dataset where conversations are grounded with knowledge retrieved from Wikipedia. The citation is:
   > Dinan, E., Roller, S., Shuster, K., Fan, A., Auli, M., & Weston, J. (2019). *Wizard of Wikipedia: Knowledge-Powered Conversational Agents*. In International Conference for Learning Representation (ICLR).

2. **CommonGen**: A generative commonsense reasoning dataset. The citation is:
   > Lin, B. Y., Zhou, W., & Ren, X. (2020). *CommonGen: A Constrained Text Generation Challenge for Generative Commonsense Reasoning*. In Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

3. **𝛼NLG-ART**: A dataset for generative commonsense reasoning. The citation is:
   > Bhagavatula, C., Le Bras, R., Malaviya, C., Sakaguchi, K., Holtzman, A., Rashkin, H., Downey, D., Yih, W. W., & Choi, Y. (2020). *Abductive Commonsense Reasoning*. In International Conference for Learning Representation (ICLR).

4. **ComVE**: A dataset for generating explanations given counterfactual statements. The citation is:
   > Ji, H., Ke, P., Huang, S., Wei, F., & Huang, M. (2020). *Generating Commonsense Explanation by Extracting Bridge Concepts from Reasoning Paths*. In Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

5. **ELI5**: A dataset for long-form question answering. The citation is:
   > Fan, A., Jernite, Y., Perez, E., Grangier, D., Weston, J., & Auli, M. (2019). *ELI5: Long Form Question Answering*. In Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

6. **SQuAD**: A dataset for answer-aware question generation. The citation is:
   > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). *SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text*. In Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

7. **CNN/DailyMail**: A dataset for summarization. The citation is:
   > See, A., Liu, P. J., & Manning, C. D. (2017). *Get To The Point: Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks*. In Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

8. **Gigaword**: Another dataset for summarization. The citation is:
   > Napoles, C., Sakaguchi, K., & Van Durme, B. (2012). *The Gigaword Corpus: A New Dataset for Summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2012 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (NAACL-HLT).

Next, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, as they are crucial for proper referencing. I will compile the dataset names along with their citations into a structured format for clarity.

Finally, I will summarize my findings and prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
