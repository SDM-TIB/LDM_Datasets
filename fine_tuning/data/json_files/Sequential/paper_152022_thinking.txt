To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probabilistic Vehicle Trajectory Prediction over Occupancy Grid Map via Recurrent Neural Network" by ByeoungDo Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses a vehicle trajectory prediction framework, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section II (System Description)** and **section V (Experiments)**, as these sections typically contain details about the data used for experiments. In section V, the authors describe the data collection process, indicating that they collected trajectory data from a test vehicle equipped with sensors during long-term driving on highways. They mention that the data was collected over 3730 seconds from 26 scenarios, with 1325 vehicles detected.

I will note the specifics of the dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: Highway Driving Trajectory Dataset
- **Description**: This dataset consists of trajectory data collected from a test vehicle equipped with sensors during various driving scenarios on highways. It includes data from 1325 vehicles detected for more than 4 seconds within the valid detection range.
- **Size**: 3730 seconds of driving data, covering multiple scenarios such as cruising, lane changes, and merges.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the dataset. However, the dataset appears to be original data collected by the authors, so it may not have a formal citation in the references. In this case, I will create a citation for the dataset based on the paper itself.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> ByeoungDo Kim, Chang Mook Kang, Jaekyum Kim, Seung Hi Lee, Chung Choo Chung, and Jun Won Choi. *Probabilistic Vehicle Trajectory Prediction over Occupancy Grid Map via Recurrent Neural Network*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, size, and citation in a structured format for clarity and future reference.
