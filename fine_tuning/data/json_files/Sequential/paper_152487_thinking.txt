To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpreting Recurrent and Attention-Based Neural Models: a Case Study on Natural Language Inference" by Reza Ghaeini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the interpretation of deep learning models for natural language inference (NLI), but it does not specify any datasets. I will then check the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in their experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of the **SNLI dataset** (Stanford Natural Language Inference) as a key dataset for training their models. This is a significant finding, as it indicates that the authors utilized this dataset for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the paper, the authors describe their experiments and confirm that they trained their models using the **SNLI dataset**. They also mention that they trained two variants of the ESIM model (ESIM-50 and ESIM-300) using this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SNLI dataset. The citation for the SNLI dataset is as follows:

- **SNLI Dataset**: 
  > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, EMNLP 2015, Lisbon, Portugal, September 17-21, 2015, pages 632â€“642.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **SNLI Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the models in the context of natural language inference. It is a large annotated corpus that provides pairs of sentences with labels indicating their logical relationship (entailment, contradiction, or neutral).

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
