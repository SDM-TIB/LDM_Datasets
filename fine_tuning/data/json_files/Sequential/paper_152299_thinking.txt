To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Contextual Conversation Learning with Labeled Question-Answering Pairs" by Kun Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model on a dataset of labeled question-answering pairs in Chinese, which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their research. In **section 4.1 (The Topic-Aware Dataset)**, they mention that they collected over 200 million QA pairs from two major community question-answering (cQA) websites in China: **Baidu Zhidao** and **Sogou Wenwen**. They also specify that they selected 40 categories for the dataset, resulting in a total of ten million QA pairs with at least one best answer.

In **section 4.2 (Conversational Dataset)**, the authors describe another dataset acquired from two popular forum websites: **Baidu Tieba** and **Douban**. They collected approximately 100 million open-domain posts and organized them into independent dialogues.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

1. For the **Topic-Aware Dataset**, the citation is:
   > Baidu Zhidao: http://zhidao.baidu.com/, Sogou Wenwen: http://wenwen.sogou.com/

2. For the **Conversational Dataset**, the citation is:
   > Baidu Tieba: https://tieba.baidu.com/, Douban: https://www.douban.com/

Having identified the datasets and their sources, I will now compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation.

This process ensures that I accurately represent the datasets used in the research and provide proper attribution, which is crucial for academic integrity and reproducibility.
