To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multistream Graph Attention Networks for Wind Speed Forecasting" by Dogan Aykas and Siamak Mehrkanoon, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper uses real weather data collected from several cities in Denmark and the Netherlands, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Numerical Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two distinct datasets:

1. **Netherlands Dataset**: This dataset contains hourly measurements of six weather variables (wind speed, wind direction, temperature, dew point, air pressure, and rain amount) collected from various weather stations in the Netherlands, including Schiphol, De Bilt, Leeuwarden, Eelde, Rotterdam, Eindhoven, and Maastricht. The data spans from January 1, 2011, to March 29, 2020, with specific training and testing splits.

2. **Denmark Dataset**: This dataset includes hourly observations of four weather variables (temperature, pressure, wind speed, and wind direction) from five weather stations in Denmark: Aalborg, Aarhus, Esbjerg, Odense, and Roskilde. The data covers the years 2000 to 2010, with training and testing splits specified.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** for any papers or sources that describe these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely based on publicly available weather data from national meteorological services.

Given that the datasets are derived from real-world weather data, I will note that the authors have not provided formal citations for these datasets in the references. Instead, I will mention the source of the data as the respective national meteorological services of the Netherlands and Denmark.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and note the lack of formal citations:

1. **Netherlands Dataset**: 
   - Description: Hourly measurements of six weather variables from multiple weather stations in the Netherlands.
   - Source: National meteorological service of the Netherlands.

2. **Denmark Dataset**: 
   - Description: Hourly observations of four weather variables from various weather stations in Denmark.
   - Source: National meteorological service of Denmark.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I clearly indicate the sources of the datasets as national meteorological services.
