To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning for Food Review and Recommendation" by Le Tan Khang and Hui Siu Cheung, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a web-based food review system and mentions the use of deep learning approaches, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section more closely. Here, the authors mention analyzing food review data from a website containing food reviews on restaurants and food stalls at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). This indicates that there is a specific dataset related to NTU food reviews, but I need to find more details.

Moving on to the **experiments or methodology sections**, I will look for any specific references to datasets used for training or evaluation. In the paper, the authors mention using the **Yelp reviews dataset** for sentiment analysis, which is a well-known dataset in the deep learning community. They specify that they only consider reviews categorized as food or restaurants.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Yelp reviews dataset. The citation is as follows:
- For the **Yelp reviews dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1509.01626, 2015.

Additionally, the authors mention using 539 food reviews obtained from the Yelp dataset for evaluating their proposed adjective-noun pair extraction algorithm. However, since this is a subset of the Yelp dataset, I will still reference the original dataset citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
