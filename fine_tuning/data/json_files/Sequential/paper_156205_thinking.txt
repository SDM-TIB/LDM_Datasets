To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrast-augmented Diffusion Model with Fine-grained Sequence Alignment for Markup-to-Image Generation" by Guojin Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that extensive experiments were conducted on four benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors describe four datasets:

1. **Math Dataset**: This dataset consists of real-world mathematical expressions written in LaTeX markups and their rendered images. It contains 55,033 training pairs, 6,072 validation pairs, and 1,024 testing pairs.

2. **Simple Tables Dataset**: This dataset is based on 100k synthesized HTML snippets and their corresponding rendered webpage images. It includes 80,000 training pairs, 10,000 validation pairs, and 1,024 testing pairs.

3. **Sheet Music Dataset**: This dataset uses LilyPond files as its markup language and generates 32,880 markup-image pairs, with 30,902 for training, 989 for validation, and 988 for testing.

4. **Molecule Dataset**: This dataset contains 19,925 2D molecule images specified by SMILES strings, divided into 17,925 training samples, 1,000 validation samples, and 1,000 testing samples.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are described in the context of the paper without specific external citations, as they are likely original datasets created or compiled by the authors for their experiments.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples and the context in which they were used.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and that I have captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
