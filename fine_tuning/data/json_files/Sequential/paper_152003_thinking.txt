To extract datasets from the research paper titled "House Price Prediction Using LSTM" by Xiaochen Chen, Lai Wei, and Jiaxin Xu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors use house price data from January 2004 to October 2016 to predict future prices. This suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the significance of house prices and mention that they collected house price information from various districts. This reinforces the idea that a dataset is being utilized, but I need to look for explicit names or descriptions.

Moving on to **section 3 (Evaluation)**, I will focus on the **Dataset** subsection. The authors describe their dataset as containing house prices from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen from January 2004 to September 2016, covering 80 districts. They mention that they calculated the average house price for each district over 154 months, which provides a clearer understanding of the dataset's structure.

In this section, they also explain how they processed the data, including grouping it by month and district, and how they prepared it for training and validation. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the dataset. However, it appears that the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it seems to be original data collected by the authors. In this case, I will note that the dataset is derived from their own collection of house price information.

To summarize, I will document the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: House Price Dataset
   - **Description**: Contains average house prices (RMB/mÂ²) from January 2004 to September 2016 for 80 districts in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. The dataset includes 154 months of data, with preprocessing steps to calculate average prices and prepare the data for machine learning models.
   - **Citation**: Not explicitly cited; original data collected by the authors.

After gathering this information, I will compile it into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and provided the necessary citation information, even if it is based on the authors' own data collection efforts.
