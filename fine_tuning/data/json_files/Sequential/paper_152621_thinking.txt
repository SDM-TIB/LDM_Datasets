To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extractive Summarization of EHR Discharge Notes" by Emily Alsentzer and Anne Kim, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the development of an LSTM model for summarizing discharge notes, which suggests that a dataset is involved in the evaluation of this model.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methods)**, where the authors describe the data used for their experiments. They specifically mention the **MIMIC-III database**, which is a key dataset for their research. I will extract the relevant details about this dataset, including its purpose and contents.

In **section 3.1 (Data)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the MIMIC-III database, stating that it contains electronic health records of patients admitted to an ICU at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. They specify that the database includes 55,177 discharge reports and 4,475 discharge addendums for 41,127 distinct patients. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Lehman, L. W. C., & Feng, M. (2016). MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data*, 3, 160035. doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.35.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and ready for any further processing or review, emphasizing the importance of accurate citation for academic integrity and reproducibility.
