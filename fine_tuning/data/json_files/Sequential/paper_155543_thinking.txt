To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "DDKtor: Automatic Diadochokinetic Speech Analysis" by Yael Segal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study involves two deep neural network models and mentions the evaluation on datasets of DDK productions, which suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Younger NT Adults dataset**: This dataset includes speech from 92 neurotypical adult participants, with details about the collection process and the specific tasks (AMR and SMR) involved. The authors provide information about the sampling rate and the division of participants into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Older PD Adults dataset**: This dataset consists of speech samples from 5 older adults with Parkinson’s Disease, detailing the selection process and the specific tasks performed. The authors also mention the sampling rate and the context of the study from which the participants were drawn.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Younger NT Adults dataset**, the citation is:
  > Buchwald, A., Calhoun, H., Rimikis, S., Lowe, M. S., Wellner, R., & Edwards, D. J. (2019). *Using tDCS to facilitate motor learning in speech production: The role of timing*. Cortex, 111, 274–285.

- For the **Older PD Adults dataset**, the citation is:
  > Farhan, S. M., Bartha, R., Black, S. E., Corbett, D., Finger, E., Freedman, M., Greenberg, B., Grimes, D. A., Hegele, R. A., Hudson, C., et al. (2017). *The Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI)*. Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences, 44(2), 196–202.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
