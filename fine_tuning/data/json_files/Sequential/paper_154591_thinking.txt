To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TANTRA: Timing-Based Adversarial Network Traffic Reshaping Attack" by Yam Sharon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation or training.

Next, I will focus on **section 6.1.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for specific names, descriptions, and any relevant details about how these datasets were utilized in the study.

The paper mentions two datasets:

1. **Kitsune Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as containing network traffic recordings of various attacks and benign traffic. I will note the specifics provided about its structure and usage in the experiments.

2. **CIC-IDS2017 Dataset**: Similar to the Kitsune dataset, this dataset is also used for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed method. I will extract details about its characteristics and how it was employed in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for are:

- For the **Kitsune Dataset**, I will find the original paper or source that describes this dataset in detail.
- For the **CIC-IDS2017 Dataset**, I will also locate the original reference that provides comprehensive information about this dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining the integrity of the information and ensuring proper credit is given to the original sources.
