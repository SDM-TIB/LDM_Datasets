To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conditional set generation using SEQ2SEQ models" by Aman Madaan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss improvements on four benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe the tasks and datasets used. In **Section 4.1 (Setup)**, they mention the following datasets:

1. **Go-Emotions Dataset**: This dataset is used for fine-grained emotion classification, where the task is to generate a set of emotions for a given paragraph.

2. **Open Entity Typing Dataset**: This dataset is used for assigning open types (free-form phrases) to tagged entities in the input text.

3. **Reuters-21578 Dataset**: This dataset is used for labeling news articles with a set of mentioned economic subjects.

4. **KP20K Dataset**: This dataset is used for keyphrase generation, involving generating keyphrases for scientific paper abstracts.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide statistics and examples for each dataset, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Go-Emotions Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dorottya Demszky, Dana Movshovitz-Attias, Jeongwoo Ko, Alan Cowen, Gaurav Nemade, and Sujith Ravi. *GoEmotions: A dataset of fine-grained emotions*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 4040–4054, 2020.

- For **Open Entity Typing Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Eunsol Choi, Omer Levy, Yejin Choi, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *Ultra-fine entity typing*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 87–96, 2018.

- For **Reuters-21578 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > David Lewis. *Reuters-21578 text categorization test collection, distribution 1.0*. 1997. Available at: http://www.research.att.com/lewis/reuters21578/.

- For **KP20K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rui Meng, Xingdi Yuan, Tong Wang, Peter Brusilovsky, Adam Trischler, and Daqing He. *Deep keyphrase generation*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 582–592, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
