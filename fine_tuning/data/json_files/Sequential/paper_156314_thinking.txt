To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards LOGIGLUE: A Brief Survey and A Benchmark for Analyzing Logical Reasoning Capabilities of Language Models" by Man Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors compiled a benchmark called LOGIGLUE, which includes 24 varied datasets for logical reasoning tasks. This suggests that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any section that discusses the datasets in detail. In this paper, the datasets are mentioned in **section 3 (LOGIGLUE: General Logical Reasoning Benchmark)**, where the authors describe the benchmark and the datasets included.

In this section, I will note the following datasets mentioned:

1. **αARCT**: A dataset created in 2019 for logical reasoning tasks.
2. **αNLI**: Another dataset from 2019, focused on natural language inference.
3. **CLUTTR-Robust**: A dataset from 2019 designed for reasoning tasks.
4. **AbductionRule-Animal**: A dataset from 2019 for abductive reasoning.
5. **ANLI**: A dataset from 2020 for adversarial natural language inference.
6. **LogiQA**: A dataset from 2021 for logical reasoning in question answering.
7. **LogicNLI**: A dataset from 2021 for logical reasoning tasks.
8. **ProofWriter**: A dataset from 2021 for generating logical proofs.
9. **Rulebert-Union**: A dataset from 2021 for evaluating reasoning capabilities.
10. **FOLIO**: A dataset from 2022 for first-order logic reasoning.
11. **bAbi**: A dataset from 2015 for various reasoning tasks.
12. **Bird-Electricity**: A dataset from 2021 for reasoning tasks.
13. **Winologic**: A dataset from 2021 for logical reasoning.
14. **WaNLI**: A dataset from 2022 for natural language inference.
15. **BigBench**: A dataset from 2022 for benchmarking logical reasoning.
16. **PrOntoQA**: A dataset from 2023 for logical reasoning tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution. I will look for the original papers or sources where these datasets were introduced or described.

For example, I will find the following citations:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations to ensure proper documentation and attribution. This structured approach will help in accurately extracting and presenting the datasets from the paper.
