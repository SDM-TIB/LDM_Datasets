To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StyleMelGAN: An Efficient High-Fidelity Adversarial Vocoder with Temporal Adaptive Normalization" by Ahmed Mustafa et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of StyleMelGAN in various scenarios, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors mention training StyleMelGAN using the **LJSpeech corpus**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used, and I will need to gather more details about it.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citation of the LJSpeech corpus. The authors reference it as follows:

- **LJSpeech corpus**: 
  > K. Ito and L. Johnson, “The LJ Speech Dataset,” https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/, 2017.

This citation provides the necessary information to include in the dataset entry.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **LJSpeech corpus**: This dataset is used for training the StyleMelGAN model. It consists of speech recordings and is commonly used in text-to-speech research.

With this information, I can now prepare to create the dataset entry according to the required format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the LJSpeech corpus. 

After compiling the dataset entry, I will ensure that it is structured correctly and ready for any further processing or review.
