To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models" by Stephen Merity et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the pointer sentinel-LSTM model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **Penn Treebank** and introduces the **WikiText** corpus. This indicates that these two datasets are significant for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (WikiText - A Benchmark for Language Modeling)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, I will find specific information about the **Penn Treebank** and the **WikiText** datasets, including their sizes, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

1. **Penn Treebank**: The authors describe it as consisting of 929,590 training words, 73,761 validation words, and 82,431 test words. They also mention that it has a vocabulary size of 10,000 and an out-of-vocabulary (OoV) rate of 4.8%. This dataset is widely used for language modeling tasks.

2. **WikiText**: The paper introduces two versions of this dataset: **WikiText-2** and **WikiText-103**. WikiText-2 is described as being two times the size of the Penn Treebank, while WikiText-103 is significantly larger, containing over 103 million words. The authors note that both datasets feature punctuation, original casing, and a larger vocabulary, making them suitable for capturing long-range dependencies in language modeling.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, C. (1993). Building a Large Annotated Corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

- For the **WikiText** dataset, the citation is:
  > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2016). Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.07843*.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further use or analysis.
