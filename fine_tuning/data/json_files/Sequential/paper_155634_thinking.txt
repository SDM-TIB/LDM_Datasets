To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Impact Analysis of Recovery Cases Due to COVID-19 Outbreak Using Deep Learning Model" by Md Ershadul Haque and Samiul Hoque, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used data from **258 regions** regarding recovery cases over a period of **403 days**. This suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Proposed Methodology)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Data Collection and Description)**, where the authors describe the dataset they collected. They mention that the data was sourced from a **GitHub repository** managed by the **CSSE (Center for Systems Science and Engineering) of Johns Hopkins University**. The dataset contains recovery cases across the globe from **January 22, 2020, to February 27, 2021**. This is a crucial piece of information as it provides both the source and the time frame of the dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- **COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University**. Retrieved from [https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format. The dataset is clearly defined, including its source and the time frame it covers. 

After gathering all necessary information, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and ready for any further processing or review.
