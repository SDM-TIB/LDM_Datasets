To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Drawing and Recognizing Chinese Characters with Recurrent Neural Network" by Xu-Yao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on the **ICDAR-2013 competition database**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of recognizing handwritten Chinese characters and reference the **CASIA database**, which is used for training and testing their models. This indicates that the CASIA database is another important dataset.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of how these datasets were used. The authors mention that they used the **ICDAR-2013 competition database** for evaluating their recognition model and the **CASIA database** for training their generative model. This confirms the relevance of both datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ICDAR-2013 competition database**, the citation is:
   > F. Yin, Q.-F. Wang, X.-Y. Zhang, and C.-L. Liu. "ICDAR 2013 Chinese handwriting recognition competition." In Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 2013.

2. For the **CASIA database**, the citation is:
   > C.-L. Liu, F. Yin, D.-H. Wang, and Q.-F. Wang. "CASIA online and offline Chinese handwriting databases." In Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 2011.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **ICDAR-2013 competition database**: A dataset used for evaluating the performance of handwriting recognition systems, consisting of various handwritten Chinese characters.
- **CASIA database**: A comprehensive dataset used for training models in recognizing handwritten Chinese characters, containing a large number of samples from different writers.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
