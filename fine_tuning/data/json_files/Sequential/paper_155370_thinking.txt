To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decision-making of Emergent Incident based on P-MADDPG" by Yibo Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors may discuss the context of their research and any relevant datasets that have been previously used in similar studies. This section often contains citations to foundational datasets in the field.

I will then examine the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that detail the experimental setup. Here, the authors may specify the datasets used for training and testing their proposed P-MADDPG algorithm. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **results section**, I will check for any mentions of datasets in the context of the experiments conducted. The authors may provide performance metrics based on these datasets, which can help confirm their relevance.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might read something like:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for presentation or further processing, ensuring that all information is accurate and well-organized.
