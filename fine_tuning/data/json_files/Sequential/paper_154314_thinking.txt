To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "A Chinese Text Classification Method With Low Hardware Requirement Based on Improved Model Concatenation" by Qingli Man and Yuanhao Zhuo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the model and its performance but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments** sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various models and their hardware requirements but do not mention specific datasets. Moving on to the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Data Set)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their experiments.

The paper describes three datasets:

1. **Complete Dataset**: This dataset includes both long and short texts, simulating a universal situation for training. It contains approximately 6 million pieces of data across 25 categories, with a maximum text length of 5000 Chinese characters and a minimum of 10 characters.

2. **Short Text Dataset**: This dataset consists solely of short texts with a maximum length of 500 characters. The texts are primarily informal and sourced from platforms like Weibo.

3. **Long Text Dataset**: This dataset contains only long texts exceeding 500 characters, mainly sourced from formal articles, blogs, and self-media.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, the datasets described in the paper do not have specific citations as they are derived from the authors' own data collection efforts.

Since the datasets are not formally published datasets with associated citations, I will note that the authors have created these datasets from various Chinese text sources, including Weibo, blogs, and other media.

Now, I will compile the dataset descriptions, ensuring to include the relevant details such as the number of categories, text lengths, and sources, while acknowledging the lack of formal citations for these datasets.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
