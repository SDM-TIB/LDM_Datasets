To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Insulin-Glucose Dynamics in the Wild" by Andrew C. Miller et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the study's objectives and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors developed a model using real-world data from two T1D participants, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Cohort and Data)**, where the authors describe the data collected from the two participants. They mention that the data includes measurements from a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and an insulin pump, collected every five minutes over a 150-day period. This section provides crucial details about the datasets used in the study.

In this section, the authors specify the types of data collected:
- **Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) measurements**: Blood glucose levels recorded every five minutes.
- **Insulin delivery data**: Both basal and bolus insulin units delivered.
- **Carbohydrate ingestion data**: Estimated grams of carbohydrates consumed.
- **Energy expenditure data**: Estimated active energy burned (METs).

The paper also mentions that the data for each participant includes over 40,000 data points, which indicates the scale of the datasets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or tools mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from the authors' own data collection (CGM and insulin pump data), there may not be formal citations for these datasets. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

The relevant dataset information I will compile includes:
1. **Participant 1 Data**: Continuous glucose measurements, insulin delivery, carbohydrate intake, and energy expenditure over 150 days.
2. **Participant 2 Data**: Similar measurements as Participant 1, also collected over 150 days.

Since the datasets are not publicly available and are specific to the study participants, I will document them as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Participant 1 T1D Data
  - **Description**: Observational measurements from a continuous glucose monitor and insulin pump, including blood glucose levels, insulin delivery, carbohydrate intake, and energy expenditure, collected every five minutes over 150 days.
  
- **Dataset Name**: Participant 2 T1D Data
  - **Description**: Similar observational measurements as Participant 1, collected from a second T1D participant over the same time period.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of the datasets used in the study. I will prepare to present this information in a structured format for further analysis or review.
