To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Fast deterministic tourist walk for texture analysis" by Lucas Correia Ribas and Odemir Martinez Bruno, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using the **Brodatz** and **Vistex** datasets, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Brodatz Dataset**: This dataset consists of synthetic images collected from the Brodatz book, widely used in computer vision literature for texture recognition. It includes 110 classes, each with 10 samples, and each image has a size of 200 × 200 pixels with 256 gray levels.

2. **Vistex Dataset**: This dataset contains 864 samples of real-world textures captured under various conditions. Each image in this dataset has a size of 128 × 128 pixels and also has 256 gray levels, with a total of 54 texture classes, each containing 16 samples.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Brodatz Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Brodatz, P. *Textures: a photographic album for artists and designers*. Dover Publications, 1966.

- For the **Vistex Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Picard, R. W., & Minka, T. P. (1995). "Vision texture for annotation." *Multimedia Systems*, 3(1), 3–14.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly credited in any subsequent analysis or documentation.
