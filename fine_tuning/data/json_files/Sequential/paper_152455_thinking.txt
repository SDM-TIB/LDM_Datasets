To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Abstractive and Extractive Text Summarization using Document Context Vector and Recurrent Neural Networks" by Chandra Khatri et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention leveraging datasets from eBay for product description summarization. This indicates that there are specific datasets related to eBay product descriptions, which I need to locate.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Human Extracted Snippets**: This dataset consists of 20,000 items/documents with corresponding details (titles, URLs, descriptions) provided to humans for extracting summaries. Out of these, 5,000 items were used for evaluations (Golden Set), and 15,000 items were used for training different models.

2. **Semi-supervised Large Scale Summarization Approximation**: This dataset includes sentences from 100,000 item descriptions that were extracted and ranked based on relevance to the document context. The authors reference techniques for ranking sentences based on various criteria.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are not attributed to external sources but are rather created or compiled by the authors themselves for the purpose of this study.

Since the datasets are original to this research, I will note them down with the appropriate context:

- For **Human Extracted Snippets**, the citation is:
  > Khatri, C., Singh, G., & Parikh, N. (2018). Abstractive and Extractive Text Summarization using Document Context Vector and Recurrent Neural Networks. In KDD’18 Deep Learning Day, London, UK.

- For **Semi-supervised Large Scale Summarization Approximation**, the citation is the same:
  > Khatri, C., Singh, G., & Parikh, N. (2018). Abstractive and Extractive Text Summarization using Document Context Vector and Recurrent Neural Networks. In KDD’18 Deep Learning Day, London, UK.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations for further processing or review.
