To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RandomNet: Towards Fully Automatic Neural Architecture Design for Multimodal Learning" by Stefano Alletto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors reference the **AV-MNIST dataset**, indicating that it is used for evaluation. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. The **experimental results** section is likely to provide more information about the datasets used. Here, the authors describe the **AV-MNIST dataset** as a bi-modal dataset composed of images and audio, with specific details about its composition and preprocessing.

I will also check the **methodology** section to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide further context about the AV-MNIST dataset. The paper states that the first modality consists of images from the MNIST dataset, while the second modality features audio from the Free Spoken Digits dataset, which is also relevant.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **AV-MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 55,000 training samples, 5,000 validation samples, and 10,000 test samples, composed of images and audio. The authors provide details about the preprocessing steps for both modalities.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: The original dataset from which the first modality images are derived. It consists of handwritten digits and is widely used in machine learning.

3. **Free Spoken Digits Dataset**: This dataset is used for the audio modality, featuring pronounced digits.

4. **ESC-50 Dataset**: Mentioned in the context of adding noise to the audio samples from the Free Spoken Digits dataset.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for each dataset:

- For the **AV-MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Valentin Vielzeuf, Alexis Lechervy, S. P. F. J. (2018). *CentralNet: A multilayer approach for multimodal fusion*. In Proc. of ECCV Workshops.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For the **Free Spoken Digits Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zach Jackson. *Free Spoken Digit Dataset*. 2017.

- For the **ESC-50 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > K. J. Piczak. *ESC: Dataset for Environmental Sound Classification*. In Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia, 1015â€“1018. ACM, 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for clarity and proper attribution.
