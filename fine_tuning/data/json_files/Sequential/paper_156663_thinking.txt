To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Millimeter Wave Radar-Based Human Activity Recognition for Healthcare Monitoring Robot" by Zhanzhong Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three datasets, which indicates that I should find more details about these datasets in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Evaluation)**, specifically **subsection 4.1.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **MMActivity Dataset**: This dataset consists of indoor human activity data, including five activities (walking, jumping, jumping jacks, squats, and boxing) performed by subjects in front of a radar. The dataset is noted for its specific characteristics, such as the radar's configuration and the duration of recordings.

2. **discHAR Dataset**: This is a self-constructed dataset that captures discrete human activities without considering transitions between events. It is collected using a movable robot-mounted mmWave radar platform.

3. **contHAR Dataset**: Another self-constructed dataset that captures continuous human activities, including transitions between different activities. This dataset is also collected using the same radar platform as discHAR.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **MMActivity Dataset**:
  > A. D. Singh, S. S. Sandha, L. Garcia, and M. Srivastava. *Radhar: Human activity recognition from point clouds generated through a millimeter-wave radar*. In Proceedings of the 3rd ACM Workshop on Millimeter-wave Networks and Sensing Systems, 2019, pp. 51â€“56.

- For **discHAR Dataset** and **contHAR Dataset**: Since these are self-constructed datasets, they may not have formal citations in the literature. However, I will note that they were created by the authors of this paper and describe their characteristics as mentioned in the text.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, if available. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
