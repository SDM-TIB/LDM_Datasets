To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Locality-Aware Attention Network with Discriminative Dynamics Learning for Weakly Supervised Anomaly Detection" by Yujiang Pu and Xiaoyu Wu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to their method achieving significant improvements on two benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **UCF-Crime**: This dataset is described as a large-scale collection of surveillance videos with a total duration of 128 hours, containing 1900 long untrimmed videos. It covers 13 types of anomalies and includes 1610 training videos and 290 test videos.

2. **XD-Violence**: This dataset consists of 4754 untrimmed videos covering 6 types of violence events. It includes both video-level labeled training sets and frame-level labeled test sets, with a total duration of 217 hours.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **UCF-Crime**, the citation is:
  > Waqas Sultani, Chen Chen, and Mubarak Shah. *Real-world anomaly detection in surveillance videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 6479–6488, 2018.

- For **XD-Violence**, the citation is:
  > Peng Wu, Jing Liu, Yujia Shi, Yujia Sun, Fangtao Shao, Zhaoyang Wu, and Zhiwei Yang. *Not only look, but also listen: Learning multimodal violence detection under weak supervision*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 322–339, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
