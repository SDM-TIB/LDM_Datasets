To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Speedy Performance Estimation for Neural Architecture Search" by Binxin Ru et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of their method on various NAS search spaces, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of estimating generalization performance in NAS, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

I will then focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention several NAS search spaces and the datasets associated with them:

1. **NASBench-201**: This dataset contains information on 15,625 different neural architectures, each trained and evaluated on three datasets: **CIFAR10**, **CIFAR100**, and **ImageNet-16-120**. The paper states that the training accuracy/loss and validation accuracy/loss after every training epoch are accessible from this dataset.

2. **RandWiredNN**: This dataset was generated by creating 552 randomly wired neural architectures evaluated on the **Flowers102** dataset. The authors describe the methodology for generating these architectures and their training setup.

3. **DARTS**: The DARTS search space is mentioned, which contains over 10^18 architectures. The paper describes how datasets were generated for experiments, specifically mentioning that three datasets were used, but it does not specify them in this section.

4. **NASBench-301**: This dataset includes 23,000 architectures drawn from the DARTS search space, evaluated on **CIFAR10**. The paper provides details about the training setup and the surrogate model used for performance prediction.

5. **ResNet**: The authors mention using ResNet architectures trained on **CIFAR10** for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
