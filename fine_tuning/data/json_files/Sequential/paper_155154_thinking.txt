To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainable Sentence-Level Sentiment Analysis for Amazon Product Reviews" by Xuechun Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I identify and accurately cite the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions conducting sentiment analysis on product reviews from Amazon, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention the **Amazon Musical Instruments Reviews** dataset, detailing that it contains 10,261 product reviews sourced from the Amazon platform. This section provides essential information about the dataset, including its structure and the types of data it contains.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that the authors used the **Amazon Musical Instruments Reviews** dataset for their analysis, which they do, reinforcing its significance in their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from Amazon and not a standalone publication, I will note that it is commonly referenced as follows:

- **Amazon Musical Instruments Reviews**: 
  > McAuley, J. J., & Leskovec, J. (2013, May). From amateurs to connoisseurs: modeling the evolution of user expertise through online reviews. In Proceedings of the 22nd international conference on World Wide Web (pp. 897-908).

This citation refers to the original work that discusses the dataset's creation and context.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **Amazon Musical Instruments Reviews** dataset as required. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented for future reference or use in related research.
