To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Group Gated Fusion on Attention-based Bidirectional Alignment for Multimodal Emotion Recognition" by Pengfei Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed model outperforms existing methods on the **IEMOCAP dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional context or details about the datasets used. The introduction discusses the challenges of emotion recognition and mentions the need for multimodal datasets, but it primarily highlights the **IEMOCAP dataset** as the dataset used for evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets. The authors state that they conducted experiments using the **IEMOCAP dataset** and describe its characteristics, such as the number of sessions and the emotional categories included. This section confirms that the **IEMOCAP dataset** is the primary dataset utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **IEMOCAP dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **IEMOCAP Dataset**:
  > C. Busso, M. Bulut, C.-C. Lee, A. Kazemzadeh, E. Mower, S. Kim, J. N. Chang, S. Lee, and S. S. Narayanan. *IEMOCAP: Interactive emotional dyadic motion capture database*. Language resources and evaluation, vol. 42, no. 4, p. 335, 2008.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **IEMOCAP dataset**, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **IEMOCAP dataset** and ensure it is ready for any further processing or review.
