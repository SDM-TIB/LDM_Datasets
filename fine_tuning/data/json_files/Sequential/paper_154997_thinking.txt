To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Compression with Recurrent Neural Network and Generalized Divisive Normalization" by Khawar Islam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various image compression methods and their significance but do not specify any datasets. I will proceed to the **experiments section**, where the authors mention that they performed experiments on **20745 high-quality images from Flickr** and created a subset dataset containing **3600 training images**. This indicates that the dataset used for their experiments is derived from Flickr.

Next, I will look for any additional details about the dataset, such as how it was processed or any specific characteristics mentioned. The authors state that they generated random patches of **32Ã—32** for training, resulting in a total of **960,8744 patches**. This information is useful for describing the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Flickr dataset. However, since the authors do not provide a specific reference for the dataset itself, I will cite it as follows:

- **Flickr Dataset**: 
  > Flickr. *Flickr Image Dataset*. Available at: https://www.flickr.com (Accessed: [insert access date]).

Since the dataset is not a formal publication but rather a collection of images available on a public platform, I will note that in the citation.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and citation in a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections to identify datasets.
2. Note the dataset derived from Flickr and its characteristics.
3. Formulate a citation for the dataset based on the information available.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
