To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Joint Extraction of Entity and Relation with Information Redundancy Elimination" by Yuanhao Shen and Jungang Han, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they conducted experiments on the **ADE** and **CoNLL04** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are relevant to their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiment and Analysis)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **ADE Dataset**: This dataset includes two entity types (Drug and Adverse-Effect) and a single relation type (Adverse-Effect). It consists of 4,272 sentences and 6,821 relations in total. The authors note that they removed approximately 120 relations with overlapping entities for their evaluation.

2. **CoNLL04 Dataset**: This dataset contains four entity types (Location, Organization, Person, Other) and five relation types (Kill, Live_in, Located_in, OrgBased_in, Work_for). The dataset originally has 1,441 samples, which are divided into training, validation, and test sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ADE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gurulingappa, et al. "Development of a benchmark corpus to support the automatic extraction of drug-related adverse effects from medical case reports." *Biomedical Informatics*, vol. 45, no. 5, pp. 885–892, 2012.

- For the **CoNLL04 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Roth, D. and Yih, W. "A linear programming formulation for global inference in natural language tasks." In *Proceedings of the Eighth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning*, Boston, MA, USA, 2004, pp. 1–8.

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
