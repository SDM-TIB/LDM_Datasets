To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physical-Virtual Collaboration Modeling for Intra-and Inter-Station Metro Ridership Prediction" by Lingbo Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two large-scale benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any explicit mentions of datasets. In this section, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments, which are:

1. **SHMetro Dataset**: This dataset is based on the Shanghai metro system, containing 288 stations and 958 physical edges. It has a daily ridership of 8.82 million and is recorded at 15-minute intervals. The training timespan is from July 1, 2016, to August 31, 2016, with validation and testing periods specified.

2. **HZMetro Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Hangzhou metro system, featuring 80 stations and 248 physical edges. It has a daily ridership of 2.35 million, also recorded at 15-minute intervals. The training timespan is from January 1, 2019, to January 18, 2019, with validation and testing periods outlined.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are likely created by the authors themselves, they may not have formal citations in the literature. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

The details for the datasets are as follows:

- **SHMetro Dataset**:
  - City: Shanghai, China
  - Number of Stations: 288
  - Number of Physical Edges: 958
  - Ridership per Day: 8.82 million
  - Time Interval: 15 minutes
  - Training Timespan: July 1, 2016 - August 31, 2016
  - Validation Timespan: September 1, 2016 - September 9, 2016
  - Testing Timespan: September 10, 2016 - September 30, 2016

- **HZMetro Dataset**:
  - City: Hangzhou, China
  - Number of Stations: 80
  - Number of Physical Edges: 248
  - Ridership per Day: 2.35 million
  - Time Interval: 15 minutes
  - Training Timespan: January 1, 2019 - January 18, 2019
  - Validation Timespan: January 19, 2019 - January 20, 2019
  - Testing Timespan: January 21, 2019 - January 25, 2019

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include all relevant details for each dataset as described above. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
