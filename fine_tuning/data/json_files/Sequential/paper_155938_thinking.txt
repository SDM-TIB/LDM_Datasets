To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physics-based parameterized neural ordinary differential equations: prediction of laser ignition in a rocket combustor" by Yizhou Qian et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for validation or comparison.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets or simulation data that the authors might have used to validate their model. This section often provides context for the research and may highlight key datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that discuss the experimental setup or data generation. Here, the authors may describe the specific datasets they used, including any parameters or conditions under which the data was collected.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used for validation. The authors may provide specifics about the simulations conducted, including the parameters varied and the resulting data collected.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using high-fidelity simulations from the "HTR solver," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. Similarly, if they refer to specific datasets generated from their experiments, I will ensure to find and note those citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with proper references for further exploration.
