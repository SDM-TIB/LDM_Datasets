To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature Engineering-Based Detection of Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Source Code Using Neural Networks" by Mst Shapna Akter et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilized a sizable dataset of C and C++ open-source code containing millions of functions with potential buffer overflow exploits. This suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their approach in detail. They mention using a dataset containing millions of function-level examples of C and C++ code from three sources: the **SATE IV Juliet Test Suite**, the **Debian Linux distribution**, and **open-source Git repositories on GitHub**. This is crucial information as it specifies the datasets used for their experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models based on the dataset, confirming its significance in their analysis. They also mention that the dataset is divided into three subfolders for training, validation, and testing, which further emphasizes its structured nature.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **SATE IV Juliet Test Suite**: The citation is:
   > "SATE IV Juliet Test Suite." National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), 2010. [Online]. Available: https://samate.nist.gov/SATE4/Juliet.html

2. **Debian Linux distribution**: The citation is:
   > Debian Project. "Debian GNU/Linux." [Online]. Available: https://www.debian.org/

3. **Open-source Git repositories on GitHub**: The citation is:
   > GitHub, Inc. "GitHub: Where the world builds software." [Online]. Available: https://github.com/

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
