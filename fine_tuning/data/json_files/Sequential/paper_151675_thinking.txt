To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GLoMo: Unsupervisedly Learned Relational Graphs as Transferable Representations" by Zhilin Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed framework improves performance on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)**: This dataset consists of over 100,000 question-answer pairs derived from 500+ Wikipedia articles. It is designed to advance machine reading comprehension.

2. **Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Corpus (MNLI)**: This dataset contains 433,000 sentence pairs annotated with textual entailment information across ten different genres of spoken and written text.

3. **IMDB Movie Review Dataset**: This dataset includes 25,000 training and 25,000 testing samples collected from IMDB for sentiment analysis tasks.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper for full citations:

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.05250, 2016.

- For **MNLI**, the citation is:
  > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel R Bowman. *A Broad-Coverage Challenge Corpus for Sentence Understanding through Inference*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.05426, 2017.

- For **IMDB**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142â€“150, Portland, Oregon, USA, June 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
