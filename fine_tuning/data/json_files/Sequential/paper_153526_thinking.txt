To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "A Comparative Study of Pretrained Language Models on Thai Social Text Categorization" by Thanapapas Horsuwan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors pre-trained a language model on a large noisy Thai social media corpus, which suggests that there is a significant dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe their datasets in detail. This section is crucial as it outlines both the pretraining dataset and the benchmarking datasets used for evaluation.

1. **Pretraining Dataset**: The authors mention that they collected a Thai social media corpus from Pantip.com, which includes over 1.26 billion tokens. They provide specific details about the number of threads extracted and the preprocessing steps taken. This dataset is essential for their experiments.

2. **Benchmarking Datasets**: The paper describes two specific datasets used for benchmarking:
   - **Wongnai Challenge**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification and consists of user-written reviews with ratings from 1 to 5 stars. The authors mention that it originated from a Kaggle competition.
   - **Wisesight Sentiment Analysis**: Another dataset for multi-class classification, which includes data from various social media sources and is also based on a Kaggle competition.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Pantip dataset**, since it is a collection of threads from a website, it may not have a formal citation like a published paper, but I will note its source as Pantip.com.
- For the **Wongnai Challenge**, I will look for the original competition page or any associated publication that describes the dataset.
- For the **Wisesight Sentiment Analysis**, I will similarly search for the competition details or any relevant publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations and descriptions as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
