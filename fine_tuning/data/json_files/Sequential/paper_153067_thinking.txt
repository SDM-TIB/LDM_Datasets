To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compositional generalization through meta sequence-to-sequence learning" by Brenden M. Lake, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract does not mention specific datasets, but it introduces the concept of compositional learning, which may lead to references to datasets in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), as this is where datasets are most likely to be detailed. In this section, the author discusses the SCAN dataset, which is a benchmark for compositional learning. The SCAN dataset is mentioned multiple times, indicating its significance in the experiments.

In **section 4.2 (Experiment: Mutual exclusivity)**, the author describes how the SCAN dataset is used to evaluate the model's ability to generalize through mutual exclusivity. This section provides context on how the dataset is structured and its relevance to the experiments.

In **section 4.3 (Experiment: Adding a new primitive through permutation meta-training)**, the SCAN dataset is again referenced, emphasizing its role in testing the model's compositional learning capabilities. The author explains how the dataset is augmented for the experiments, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SCAN dataset. The SCAN dataset is referenced in the paper by Lake and Baroni (2018), which is crucial for providing the authoritative citation.

The citation for the SCAN dataset is:
> Brenden M. Lake and Marco Baroni. *Generalization without Systematicity: On the Compositional Skills of Sequence-to-Sequence Recurrent Networks*. In International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the SCAN dataset as it is the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are structured and ready for review or further processing.
