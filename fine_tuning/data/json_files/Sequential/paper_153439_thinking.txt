To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Framework for Inferring Following Strategies from Time Series of Movement Data" by Chainarong Amornbunchornvej and Tanya Berger-Wolf, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed framework on both **simulated datasets** and **two real-world datasets**: a school of fish and a troop of baboons. This indicates that there are at least two datasets that need to be documented.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **methods** and **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors discuss the performance of their framework on simulated datasets, which are generated to test the framework's capabilities. They also mention the baboon dataset and the fish dataset, which are used for real-world validation.

In the **experiments section**, I will find detailed descriptions of the datasets:

1. **Baboon Dataset**: The paper describes a dataset consisting of GPS collar recordings of an olive baboon troop in the wild at the Mpala Research Centre, Kenya. The dataset includes 16 individuals tracked over 10 days, with a total of 419,095 time steps.

2. **Fish Dataset**: The authors refer to a dataset of golden shiners (Notemigonus crysoleucas) fish positions, which was initially created to study information propagation via the fish visual fields. This dataset includes 24 trails of fish position time series, with each trail consisting of 70 fish.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Baboon Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ariana Strandburg-Peshkin, Damien R. Farine, Iain D. Couzin, and Margaret C. Crofoot. *Shared decision-making drives collective movement in wild baboons*. Science 348, 6241 (2015), 1358–1361. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa5099

- For the **Fish Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Strandburg-Peshkin et al. *Visual sensory networks and effective information transfer in animal groups*. Current Biology 23, 17 (2013), R709–R711. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.07.020

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the details into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
