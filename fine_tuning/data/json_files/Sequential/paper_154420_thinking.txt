To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrence-free unconstrained handwritten text recognition using gated fully convolutional network" by Denis Coquenet et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the model shows competitive results on the **RIMES** and **IAM** datasets, indicating that these datasets are relevant to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Experimental Study)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used:

1. **RIMES Dataset**: This dataset consists of 12,723 pages collected in the context of mail writing scenarios, featuring French handwritten text. It includes approximately 1,300 writers and has an alphabet of 100 characters. The authors specifically mention using the line-segmented version, which contains 9,947 text lines for training, 1,333 for validation, and 778 for testing.

2. **IAM Dataset**: This dataset comprises 1,539 scanned form pages from 657 writers, focusing on English handwriting. It is also available as grayscale images, and the authors use the line dataset version. The alphabet consists of 79 characters, with splits of 6,482 lines for training, 976 for validation, and 2,915 for testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **RIMES Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Emmanuele Grosicki and Haikal El Abed. *ICDAR 2011-French Handwriting Recognition Competition*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 2011, pp. 1459–1463. DOI: 10.1109/ICDAR.2011.290.

- For the **IAM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > U. Marti et al. *The IAM-database: An English sentence database for offline handwriting recognition*. In International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition (IJDAR), vol. 5, no. 1, pp. 39–46, 2002. DOI: 10.1007/s100320200071.

Now that I have the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
