To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evolve Path Tracer: Early Detection of Malicious Addresses in Cryptocurrency" by Ling Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors investigate the effectiveness of their method on "three real-world malicious address datasets." This indicates that there are specific datasets used in their experiments, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the provided text, I see a **Table 1** that summarizes dataset statistics, including the types of malicious activities (Hack, Ransomware, Darknet) and the number of positive and negative samples for each type. This table provides crucial information about the datasets used.

From the table, I can extract the following datasets:

1. **Hack Dataset**: This dataset includes addresses involved in hacking activities, with 302 positive samples and 6,582 negative samples.
2. **Ransomware Dataset**: This dataset consists of addresses related to ransomware activities, containing 322 positive samples and 21,100 negative samples.
3. **Darknet Dataset**: This dataset includes addresses associated with darknet activities, with 583 positive samples and 109,937 negative samples.

Now, I will need to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the labels for these datasets were acquired through manual searches on public forums and prior studies. However, it does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are derived from publicly available information and prior research, but I will not be able to provide formal citations as they are not explicitly listed in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and the number of samples for each category. Since the paper does not provide formal citations, I will indicate that the datasets are based on manual searches and prior studies without specific references.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

- **Hack Dataset**: 302 positive samples, 6,582 negative samples.
- **Ransomware Dataset**: 322 positive samples, 21,100 negative samples.
- **Darknet Dataset**: 583 positive samples, 109,937 negative samples.

I will document this information clearly, noting the lack of formal citations for the datasets while emphasizing their relevance to the research conducted in the paper.
