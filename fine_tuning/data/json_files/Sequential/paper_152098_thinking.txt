To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dance Dance Convolution" by Chris Donahue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions the introduction of two large public datasets for benchmarking DDR choreography algorithms, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors outline their contributions. They explicitly state that they are introducing two large curated datasets for benchmarking, which I need to detail further.

In **section 2 (Data)**, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the two datasets:

1. **Fraxtil Dataset**: This dataset consists of 90 songs choreographed by a single author known as Fraxtil. It includes five charts per song corresponding to increasing difficulty levels, totaling approximately 3.1 hours of music.

2. **In The Groove (ITG) Dataset**: This dataset is larger and contains 133 songs with one chart per difficulty level, except for 13 songs that lack charts for the highest difficulty. The total duration of this dataset is about 19.0 hours.

Both datasets contain electronic music with constant tempo and a strong beat, which is characteristic of music favored by the DDR community.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors do not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but they reference the original sources of the music and choreography. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are publicly available and curated from the DDR community, specifically mentioning the repository StepMania Online, which distributes over 350GB of packs with annotations for more than 100,000 songs.

Since the datasets are not tied to specific academic papers, I will summarize their details without formal citations but will ensure to mention their availability and the context in which they were created.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that captures the essential details, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
