To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optical Flow Reusing for High-Efficiency Space-Time Video Super Resolution" by Yuantong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the task of space-time video super-resolution and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation. This indicates that I should look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using four datasets for video super-resolution and video frame interpolation: **Vid4**, **SPMCS**, **Vimeo-90K-T**, and **REDS**. I will take note of these datasets and any details provided about them.

For each dataset, I will look for specific descriptions, such as the number of video sequences, resolution, and any particular characteristics that are highlighted by the authors. For instance, the authors mention that the **Vimeo-90K-T** dataset contains 91,701 video sequences, each consisting of 7 frames, with high-resolution frames at 448 × 256 resolution.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

1. **Vid4 Dataset**:
   > C. Liu and D. Sun. "A bayesian approach to adaptive video super resolution." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2011, pp. 209–216.

2. **SPMCS Dataset**:
   > X. Tao, H. Gao, R. Liao, J. Wang, and J. Jia. "Detail-revealing deep video super-resolution." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2017, pp. 4472–4480.

3. **Vimeo-90K-T Dataset**:
   > T. Xue, B. Chen, J. Wu, D. Wei, and W. T. Freeman. "Video enhancement with task-oriented flow." International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 127, no. 8, pp. 1106–1125, 2019.

4. **REDS Dataset**:
   > S. Nah, S. Baik, S. Hong, G. Moon, S. Son, R. Timofte, and K. Mu Lee. "NTIRE 2019 challenge on video deblurring and super-resolution: Dataset and study." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, 2019.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and can be utilized effectively in future work or analyses.
