To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gradformer: Graph Transformer with Exponential Decay" by Chuang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that Gradformer is evaluated on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the effectiveness of their method across various applications, hinting at the use of datasets for evaluation. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **NCI1**: This dataset consists of 4,110 molecule graphs from the TU dataset, representing chemical compounds screened for activity against non-small cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer cell lines.

2. **PROTEINS**: This dataset includes 1,113 protein graphs, where each graph corresponds to a protein molecule, with nodes representing amino acids and edges capturing interactions between them.

3. **MUTAG**: This dataset consists of 188 chemical compounds divided into two classes based on their mutagenic effects on a bacterium.

4. **IMDB-BINARY**: This dataset contains 1,000 movie graphs, classifying movies into two categories based on certain criteria, with nodes as actors and edges indicating collaborations.

5. **COLLAB**: This dataset consists of 5,000 graphs representing collaboration networks, where nodes represent authors and edges denote collaborations.

6. **ZINC**: This dataset includes 12,000 chemical compounds represented as graphs, with a regression task related to the solubility of the molecules.

7. **CLUSTER**: This dataset consists of 12,000 graphs used to model communities in social networks.

8. **PATTERN**: This dataset contains 14,000 graphs aimed at identifying nodes associated with one of 100 distinct subgraph patterns.

9. **ogbg-molhiv**: This dataset consists of 41,127 graphs for molecular property prediction, specifically for predicting a molecule's fitness to inhibit HIV replication.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing.
