To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TResNet: High Performance GPU-Dedicated Architecture" by Tal Ridnik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that TResNet models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on several classification datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that discuss the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating TResNet on the **ImageNet dataset** for training and also refer to several downstream datasets for transfer learning.

In the **transfer learning results section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets they used:
1. **Stanford Cars**: This dataset is used for fine-grained classification tasks.
2. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification.
3. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes.
4. **Oxford-Flowers**: Another dataset for fine-grained classification tasks.
5. **MS-COCO**: Used for multi-label classification and object detection tasks.

I will also check the **conclusion and references sections** to ensure I have the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The references will provide the necessary details for proper citation.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset:
- For **Stanford Cars**, the citation is:
  > Jonathan Krause, Jia Deng, Michael Stark, and Li Fei-Fei. *Collecting a large-scale dataset of fine-grained cars*. 2013.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **Oxford-Flowers**, the citation is:
  > Maria-Elena Nilsback and Andrew Zisserman. *Automated flower classification over a large number of classes*. In 2008 Sixth Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics & Image Processing, pages 722â€“729. IEEE, 2008.

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, Lubomir Bourdev, Ross Girshick, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, C. Lawrence Zitnick, and Piotr Dollr. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. 2014.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
