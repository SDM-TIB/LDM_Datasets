To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conv-TasNet: Surpassing Ideal Time-Frequency Magnitude Masking for Speech Separation" by Yi Luo and Nima Mesgarani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental procedures sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method but does not specify datasets. The introduction provides context but also lacks specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Experimental Procedures)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **WSJ0-2mix**: This dataset is used for two-speaker speech separation tasks. The authors state that 30 hours of training and 10 hours of validation data are generated from speakers in the WSJ0 dataset, with mixtures created at various signal-to-noise ratios.

2. **WSJ0-3mix**: This dataset is used for three-speaker speech separation tasks. Similar to WSJ0-2mix, the mixtures are generated from the WSJ0 dataset.

In this section, the authors also provide details about how the datasets were created, including the mixing process and the number of speakers involved.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The WSJ0 dataset is a well-known dataset in the speech processing community, and its citation is as follows:

- For **WSJ0-2mix** and **WSJ0-3mix**, the citation is:
  > J. R. Hershey, Z. Chen, J. Le Roux, and S. Watanabe. "Deep clustering: Discriminative embeddings for segmentation and separation." In Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2016 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 31-35, 2016.

Since both WSJ0-2mix and WSJ0-3mix are derived from the WSJ0 dataset, I will use the same citation for both.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
