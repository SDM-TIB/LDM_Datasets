To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Deterministic to Generative: Multi-Modal Stochastic RNNs for Video Captioning" by Jingkuan Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method is evaluated on two datasets: **MSVD** and **MSR-VTT**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

Next, I will look specifically in the **experiments section** to gather detailed descriptions of these datasets. In the paper, the authors provide the following information:

1. **MSVD (Microsoft Video Description Dataset)**: This dataset consists of 1,970 short video clips collected from YouTube, with an average length of about 9 seconds. It contains approximately 80,000 clip-description pairs labeled by Amazon Mechanical Turkers (AMT), with each clip having multiple sentence descriptions. The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **MSR-VTT (Microsoft Research Video-to-Text Dataset)**: This dataset contains 10,000 web video clips and 200,000 clip-sentence pairs. Each clip is annotated with 20 natural sentences by 1,327 AMT workers. It is designed to support video understanding, particularly for translating videos to text.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MSVD**, the citation is:
  > Venugopalan, S., Xu, H., Donahue, J., Rohrbach, M., Mooney, R. J., & Saenko, K. (2015). *Translating videos to natural language using deep recurrent neural networks*. In NAACL HLT, pp. 1494–1504.

- For **MSR-VTT**, the citation is:
  > Xu, J., Mei, T., Yao, T., & Rui, Y. (2016). *MSR-VTT: A large video description dataset for bridging video and language*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 5288–5296.

Having gathered this information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
