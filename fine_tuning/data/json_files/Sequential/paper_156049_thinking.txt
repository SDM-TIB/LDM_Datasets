To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Backdoor Learning on Sequence to Sequence Models" by Lichang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any textual descriptions that provide details about them.

Upon reviewing Section 4, I find that the authors mention three datasets used in their experiments:

1. **EN-DE Dataset**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks and consists of 4.5 million training pairs, 40,000 validation pairs, and 1 million test pairs.

2. **EN-CS Dataset**: Another dataset for machine translation, which includes 9.4k validation pairs and is similarly structured to the EN-DE dataset.

3. **CNN-DM Dataset**: This dataset is used for text summarization tasks and contains 287,000 documents, with a standard test set for evaluation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **EN-DE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Myle Ott, Sergey Edunov, David Grangier, and Michael Auli. *Scaling Neural Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Third Conference on Machine Translation: Research Papers, WMT 2018, Belgium, Brussels, October 31 - November 1, 2018, pages 1–9. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **EN-CS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Myle Ott, Sergey Edunov, David Grangier, and Michael Auli. *Scaling Neural Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Third Conference on Machine Translation: Research Papers, WMT 2018, Belgium, Brussels, October 31 - November 1, 2018, pages 1–9. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **CNN-DM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomás Kociský, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching Machines to Read and Comprehend*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28: Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2015, December 7-12, 2015, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, pages 1693–1701.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be easily accessed by others interested in this research.
