To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EAT-NAS: Elastic Architecture Transfer for Accelerating Large-scale Neural Architecture Search" by Jiemin Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors implement their method on a small dataset, **CIFAR-10**, and a large dataset, **ImageNet**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used in their experiments. In the experiments, the authors explicitly mention that they conduct architecture searches on **CIFAR-10** and then transfer the architecture to **ImageNet**. This confirms that both datasets are integral to their methodology.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li Li, Kai Li, and Fei-Fei Li. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In CVPR, 2009.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
