To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discovering Sound Concepts and Acoustic Relations in Text" by Anurag Kumar, Bhiksha Raj, and Ndapandula Nakashole, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses discovering acoustic concepts from large-scale text corpora, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, particularly in the context of sound concepts and acoustic environments.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Sound Concepts)** and **section 3 (Acoustic Relations)**, as these sections detail the methods used for discovering sound concepts and the relationships between sound concepts and acoustic environments. I will look for any specific datasets or corpora that the authors used in their experiments.

In **section 2.1**, the authors mention using the **ClueWeb09** corpus for discovering sound concepts. This is a significant dataset, and I will note its details. 

In **section 3**, the authors describe working with **36 acoustic environments** for their experiments. While they do not provide a specific dataset name for these environments, they list examples of environments such as "Office," "Park," "Beach," etc. I will summarize this information as it pertains to the dataset used for their acoustic relations analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The ClueWeb09 corpus is a well-known dataset, and I will find its full citation. 

The citation for the **ClueWeb09 dataset** is:
> "ClueWeb09 Dataset." Lemur Project. [Online]. Available: http://lemurproject.org/clueweb09/

For the **acoustic environments**, since they are not derived from a specific dataset but rather a collection of examples used in the study, I will note that they are part of the experimental setup but do not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the ClueWeb09 dataset and a description of the acoustic environments used in the study. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
