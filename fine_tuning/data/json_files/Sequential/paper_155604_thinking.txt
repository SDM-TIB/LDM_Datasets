To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Point Processes using Recurrent Graph Network" by Saurabh Dash et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will focus on the part where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

From the paper, I note that the authors mention several datasets in the **experiments section**:

1. **Retweets Dataset**: This dataset contains sequences of tweets where each sample has a sequence of tweets from different users.

2. **StackOverﬂow Dataset**: This dataset consists of sequences of awards that users received for answering questions on the StackOverﬂow website.

3. **MIMIC-II Dataset**: This dataset includes the visitation records of various patients to a hospital's ICU, with event markers representing diagnoses.

4. **Financial Transactions Dataset**: This dataset contains transaction records for multiple stocks on a single day, with events being buy and sell orders at various timestamps.

5. **StarCraft II Dataset**: This is a new dataset introduced by the authors for benchmarking point process models. It consists of "build-orders" representing a temporally ordered list of buildings constructed by players during a game.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The citations I find are:

- **Retweets Dataset**: 
  > Zhao, Q., et al. "Seismic." SIGKDD 2015.

- **StackOverﬂow Dataset**: 
  > Leskovec, J., & Krevl, A. "SNAP Datasets: Stanford large network dataset collection." http://snap.stanford.edu/data, 2014.

- **MIMIC-II Dataset**: 
  > Johnson, A. E. W., et al. "MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database." Scientific Data, 2016.

- **Financial Transactions Dataset**: 
  > Du, N., et al. "Recurrent marked temporal point processes: Embedding event history to vector." 2016.

- **StarCraft II Dataset**: 
  > This dataset is introduced in the paper, and no external citation is provided. It can be referenced as:
  > Dash, S., She, X., & Mukhopadhyay, S. "Learning Point Processes using Recurrent Graph Network." (2023).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references or analyses. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as presented in the paper.
