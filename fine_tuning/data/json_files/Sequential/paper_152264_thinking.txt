To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Increasing the Interpretability of Recurrent Neural Networks Using Hidden Markov Models" by Viktoriya Krakovna and Finale Doshi-Velez, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the combination of RNNs and HMMs but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are likely to be detailed.

In **section 3 (Experiments)**, the authors mention testing their models on several text datasets at the character level. They specifically list:

1. **Penn Tree Bank**: This dataset contains 5 million characters and is commonly used for language modeling tasks.
2. **Tiny Shakespeare**: This dataset consists of 1 million characters and is a collection of Shakespeare's works, often used for text generation tasks.
3. **Linux Kernel**: This dataset contains 5 million characters and is derived from the source code of the Linux operating system, used for modeling programming language data.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are well-known, I can provide their standard citations based on common knowledge:

- For **Penn Tree Bank**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, Mitchell P., Marcinkiewicz, Mary Ann, and Santorini, Beatrice. *Building a Large Annotated Corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313â€“330, 1993.

- For **Tiny Shakespeare**, there is no formal citation as it is a commonly used dataset derived from Shakespeare's works, but it can be referenced as:
  > Shakespeare, William. *The Complete Works of William Shakespeare*. Various editions.

- For **Linux Kernel**, the citation can be referenced as:
  > Torvalds, Linus. *Linux Kernel Source Code*. Available at: https://www.kernel.org/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
