To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Architectures for Nested NER through Linearization" by Jana Straková, Milan Straka, and Jan Hajič, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on four nested named entity recognition corpora, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention four nested NE corpora:

1. **ACE-2004**: This dataset is referenced as a well-known corpus for named entity recognition tasks. The authors note that they reuse the train/dev/test split used by previous authors.

2. **ACE-2005**: Similar to ACE-2004, this dataset is also a standard corpus for named entity recognition, and the authors mention using the same train/dev/test split as prior research.

3. **GENIA**: This dataset is specifically for bio-text mining and is noted to have a 90%/10% train/test split used by previous authors.

4. **Czech CNEC**: The authors describe this as the Czech Named Entity Corpus 1.0, which includes 42 fine-grained NE types and 4 containers, following the first annotation round.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ACE-2004**, the citation is:
  > George Doddington, Alexis Mitchell, Mark Przybocki, Lance Ramshaw, Stephanie Strassel, and Ralph Weischedel. *The Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program-tasks, data, and evaluation*. Proceedings of LREC, 2004.

- For **ACE-2005**, the citation is:
  > George Doddington et al. *The Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program - tasks, data, and evaluation*. LDC2006T06, 2005.

- For **GENIA**, the citation is:
  > Jing-Dong Kim, Tomoto Ohta, Yuka Tateisi, and Jun’ichi Tsujii. *GENIA corpus—A semantically annotated corpus for bio-text mining*. Bioinformatics, 19 Suppl 1:180–182, 2003.

- For **Czech CNEC**, the citation is:
  > Jana Straková, Milan Straka, and Jan Hajič. *Neural Networks for Featureless Named Entity Recognition in Czech*. In Text, Speech, and Dialogue: 19th International Conference, TSD 2016, pages 173–181. Springer International Publishing, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
