To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predictive Analysis of Bitcoin Price Considering Social Sentiments" by Pratikkumar Prajapati, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the study involves sentiment analysis from news and social media to predict Bitcoin prices, which suggests that there are datasets related to social sentiment and cryptocurrency prices.

Next, I will focus on the **Data Engineering section** where the author outlines the steps taken to create the dataset. This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. 

1. **Google News Data**: The paper describes a dataset collected from Google News, which includes news articles related to Bitcoin. The data was collected using a Python script and includes sentiment analysis results. The collection period is from January 1, 2018, to November 20, 2019.

2. **Reddit Messages Data**: Another dataset is collected from Reddit posts, specifically from the rBitcoin subreddit. This dataset includes various attributes of the posts, such as title, self-text, and sentiment analysis results. The same collection period applies here.

3. **Cryptocurrency Data**: The paper also mentions a dataset containing historical price data for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum, which was collected from cryptocurrency exchanges. This dataset includes open, high, low, close, and volume values.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or the sources from which they were derived. 

- For the **Google News dataset**, while there is no specific citation provided for the dataset itself, the methodology for data collection is described in detail, and the tools used (like the newspaper Python library) are referenced.
  
- For the **Reddit dataset**, similar to Google News, the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset but mentions the use of Pushshift APIs for data collection.

- The **cryptocurrency data** is sourced from Binance, which is mentioned in the references, and the citation for Binance is:
  > Binance. https://www.binance.com. Accessed: 2019-11-20.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details and citations for each dataset. 

1. **Google News Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset of news articles related to Bitcoin, collected from Google News, including sentiment analysis results.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided, but the methodology is detailed in the paper.

2. **Reddit Messages Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset of posts from the rBitcoin subreddit, including sentiment analysis results.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided, but the methodology is detailed in the paper.

3. **Cryptocurrency Dataset**: 
   - Description: Historical price data for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum, including open, high, low, close, and volume values.
   - Citation: 
     > Binance. https://www.binance.com. Accessed: 2019-11-20.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
