To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Translating the Unseen? Yorùbá→English MT in Low-Resource, Morphologically-Unmarked Settings" by Ife Adebara et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on machine translation between Yorùbá and English, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets utilized in the research. Here, the authors mention two specific datasets:

1. **Yorùbá Bible (Bíbélì Mímó ní Èdè Yorùbá Òde-Òní)**: This dataset is described as a modern translation of the Yorùbá Bible, which is used for creating parallel data with the English Bible.

2. **New International Version (NIV) English Bible**: This is the English counterpart used alongside the Yorùbá Bible to form the parallel dataset.

In **section 4.1 (Bible Data)**, the authors provide additional context about how the datasets were collected and organized, which reinforces their significance in the study.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Yorùbá Bible**, the citation is:
  > Biblica. *Bíbélì Mímó ní Èdè Yorùbá Òde-Òní*. Available at: https://www.Bible.com/versions/911-ycb-bibeli-mim-ni-ede-yoruba-ode-oni.

- For the **New International Version (NIV) English Bible**, the citation is:
  > Biblica. *New International Version (NIV) Bible*. Available at: https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-International-Version-NIV-Bible/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
