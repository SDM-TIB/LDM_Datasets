To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interstellar: Searching Recurrent Architecture for Knowledge Graph Embedding" by Yongqi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the context in which they were used.

In the **experiment setup (Section 4.1)**, the authors mention using two basic tasks in knowledge graphs: entity alignment and link prediction. They also refer to specific datasets used for these tasks. I will extract the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided.

The paper mentions the following datasets:

1. **Countries Dataset**: This dataset contains 271 countries and regions with two relations: "neighbor" and "locatedin." It is used for various tasks related to knowledge graph embedding.

2. **DBpedia and Wikidata Datasets**: These datasets are used for the entity alignment task, specifically subsets generated by the authors. They include cross-lingual and cross-database subsets.

3. **WN18-RR, FB15k-237, and YAGO3-10**: These datasets are mentioned in the context of link prediction tasks. They are well-known benchmark datasets in the field of knowledge graph embedding.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will include are:

- For the **Countries Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bouchard, G., Singh, S., & Trouillon, T. (2015). On approximate reasoning capabilities of low-rank vector spaces. In AAAI Spring Symposium Series.

- For the **DBpedia and Wikidata Datasets**, the citation is:
  > Auer, S., Bizer, C., Kobilarov, G., Lehmann, J., Cyganiak, R., & Ives, Z. (2007). DBpedia: A nucleus for a web of open data. In Semantic Web, pages 722â€“735.

- For the **WN18-RR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dettmers, T., Minervini, P., Stenetorp, P., & Riedel, S. (2017). Convolutional 2D knowledge graph embeddings. In AAAI.

- For the **FB15k-237 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Toutanova, K., & Chen, D. (2015). Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text inference. In Workshop on CVSMC.

- For the **YAGO3-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mahdisoltani, F., Biega, J., & Suchanek, F. M. (2013). Yago3: A knowledge base from multilingual wikipedias. In CIDR.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
