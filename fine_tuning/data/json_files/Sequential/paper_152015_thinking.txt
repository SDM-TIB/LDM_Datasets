To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Simple LSTM model for Transition-based Dependency Parsing" by Mohab Elkaref and Bernd Bohnet, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the final parser achieves scores on the **Penn Treebank**, which indicates that this dataset is used in their experiments. This is a strong lead, so I will note it down.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors describe their methodology and datasets used. They specifically mention using the **Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section from the Penn Treebank** for training, development, and testing. This confirms that the Penn Treebank is indeed the primary dataset utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Penn Treebank dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Mitchell P Marcus, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, and Beatrice Santorini. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313â€“330, 1993.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format. The key dataset identified is the **Penn Treebank**, which is crucial for the experiments conducted in this paper.

In summary, the steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify potential datasets.
2. Investigated the experiments section for explicit mentions of datasets.
3. Retrieved the full citation for the identified dataset from the references.

This methodical approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
