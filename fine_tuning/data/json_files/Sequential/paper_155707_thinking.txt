To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DIFFUSEQ: Sequence to Sequence Text Generation with Diffusion Models" by Shansan Gong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of adapting diffusion models to natural language and mention the need for effective datasets for evaluation. However, I need to look further into the paper to find specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention four specific tasks and the corresponding datasets:

1. **Commonsense Conversation Dataset**: This dataset is extracted from Reddit single-round dialogs and contains over 3 million conversational pairs. 

2. **Quasar-T Dataset**: This dataset is used for question generation and consists of document-question pairs, with 119K training samples obtained through preprocessing.

3. **Text Simplification Dataset**: Constructed by Jiang et al. (2020), this corpus contains 677K complex-simple sentence pairs with revision alignment.

4. **Quora Question Pairs (QQP)**: This dataset is sourced from the community question answering forum Quora and includes 147K positive pairs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Commonsense Conversation Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Quora Question Pairs (QQP)**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
