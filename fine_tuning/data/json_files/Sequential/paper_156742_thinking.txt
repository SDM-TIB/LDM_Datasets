To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vision-LSTM: xLSTM as Generic Vision Backbone" by Benedikt Alkin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors introduce Vision-LSTM (ViL) and discuss its application in computer vision, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the adaptation of LSTM architectures to vision tasks but do not mention specific datasets. Moving on to the **method section**, I will look for any details about the datasets used for training or evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention pre-training on **ImageNet-1K**. This dataset is a well-known benchmark in computer vision, consisting of 1.3 million training images across 1000 classes. I will note this dataset down.

Additionally, the authors refer to **ADE20K** for semantic segmentation tasks. This dataset is commonly used for scene parsing and contains images with pixel-wise annotations for various object categories. I will include this dataset as well.

Next, I will check the **VTAB-1K** benchmark mentioned in the experiments section. This benchmark consists of 19 datasets split into various categories, including natural, specialized, and structured datasets. I will note that this benchmark is used for transfer classification but will need to refer to the references section for specific datasets within VTAB-1K.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L., Li, K., and Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*.

2. For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
   > Zhou, B., Zhao, H., Puig, X., Xiao, T., Fidler, S., Barriuso, A., and Torralba, A. *Semantic understanding of scenes through the ADE20K dataset*. Int. J. Comput. Vis., 127(3):302–321, 2019.

3. For **VTAB-1K**, the citation is:
   > Zhai, X., Puigcerver, J., Kolesnikov, A., Ruyssen, P., Riquelme, C., Lucic, M., Djolonga, J., Pinto, A. S., Neumann, M., Dosovitskiy, A., et al. *A large-scale study of representation learning with the visual task adaptation benchmark*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.04867, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
