To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Journey in ESN and LSTM Visualisations on a Language Task" by Alexandre Variengien and Xavier Hinaut, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors may discuss previous work and datasets relevant to their study. I will look for specific names of datasets or references to established datasets in the field of language processing or machine learning.

In the **methods section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that describe the experimental setup, particularly those that mention the training and testing datasets. The authors may provide details about the datasets used, including their characteristics, size, and how they were generated or collected.

I will also examine the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the performance of their models on specific datasets. This may provide additional context or confirmation of the datasets used in their experiments.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may have used datasets related to language tasks, possibly including synthetic datasets generated for their experiments. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify specific datasets and their characteristics.
3. Check the references for full citations of each dataset.
4. Compile the information into a structured format for further use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
