To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Highly Relevant Questions" by Jiazuo Qiu and Deyi Xiong, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on **SQuAD**, which is a well-known dataset for question answering and can also be used for question generation. This indicates that SQuAD is likely a primary dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) to gather more details about the datasets used. In section 3.1, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on **SQuAD** and provide some context about its contents, mentioning that it contains 536 articles and over 100,000 questions. This confirms that SQuAD is indeed the dataset they utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SQuAD dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Proceedings of the Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 2383â€“2392, 2016.

Since SQuAD is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

I will create an entry for the SQuAD dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will complete the extraction process for the datasets mentioned in this research paper.
