To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling how and why aquatic vegetation removal can free rural households from poverty-disease traps" by Molly J Doruska et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the impact of removing aquatic vegetation on schistosomiasis infection rates and agricultural productivity, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these topics.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors describe their bioeconomic model and mention calibrating it with field data from northern Senegal. This indicates that there are specific datasets used for calibration, which I need to identify.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on simulations and comparisons, which may reference specific datasets used for analysis. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to data sources.

I will also check the **data availability section** at the end of the paper, which often contains links or references to datasets used in the research. In this case, the authors mention that all code and simulated data can be found at a GitHub repository, which is a crucial piece of information.

Now, I will compile the datasets I find, ensuring to include full citations for each. Based on the text, I anticipate the following datasets:

1. **Harmonized Survey on Household Living Standards, Senegal 2018-2019**: This dataset is referenced multiple times and is crucial for understanding household dynamics and agricultural practices in the study area. The citation is:
   > WAEMU Commission. Harmonized Survey on Households Living Standards, Senegal 2018-2019. Ref. SEN_2018_EHCVM_v02_M. 2018; dataset downloaded from www.microdata.worldbank.org on September 23, 2022.

2. **Field data from northern Senegal**: While the paper does not provide a specific citation for this data, it is essential for calibrating the bioeconomic model. If the authors refer to specific studies or datasets in the references, I will include those citations as well.

3. **Data from Rohr et al.**: The authors mention using experimental data from previous studies, particularly regarding the effects of aquatic vegetation removal on schistosomiasis. The citation for this data is:
   > Rohr J R, Sack A, Haggerty C, et al. Data and Code for “A planetary health innovation for disease, food, and water challenges in Africa” [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7765059

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations and any additional details that may be necessary for future reference or analysis.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
