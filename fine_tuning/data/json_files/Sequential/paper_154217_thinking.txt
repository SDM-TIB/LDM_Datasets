To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Where Are the Facts? Searching for Fact-checked Information to Alleviate the Spread of Fake News" by Nguyen Vo and Kyumin Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data collection sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a framework for searching fact-checking articles, which suggests that datasets related to tweets and fact-checking articles may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **data collection section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their dataset in detail. They mention using a dataset from Vo and Lee (2019) that provides pairs of original tweets and their corresponding fact-checking articles. This section outlines the process of how they collected and labeled the data, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

The authors specify that they have a total of **19,341 original tweet and fact-checking article pairs**, with **18,961 unique original tweets** and **2,845 fact-checking articles**. They also mention splitting the dataset into two sub-datasets based on the source of the fact-checking articles: **Snopes** and **Politifact**.

I will extract the following datasets:

1. **Full Dataset**: This dataset contains 19,341 pairs of original tweets and fact-checking articles.
2. **Snopes Dataset**: This subset includes 11,202 positive pairs made by 11,167 tweets and 1,703 fact-checking articles.
3. **Politifact Dataset**: This subset contains 2,037 positive pairs made by 2,026 tweets and 467 fact-checking articles.

Now, I will look for the full citations for these datasets in the **References section**. The relevant citation for the dataset used in this paper is:

- For the dataset from Vo and Lee (2019):
  > Nguyen Vo and Kyumin Lee. *Learning from fact-checkers: Analysis and generation of fact-checking language*. In Proceedings of the 42nd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pages 335â€“344, 2019.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
