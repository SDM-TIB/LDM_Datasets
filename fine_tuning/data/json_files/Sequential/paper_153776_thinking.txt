To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LiDAR-based Online 3D Video Object Detection with Graph-based Message Passing and Spatiotemporal Transformer Attention" by Junbo Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **nuScenes benchmark**, indicating that this is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The introduction discusses the importance of LiDAR-based 3D object detection and references the **nuScenes dataset** as a large-scale dataset used for evaluation. This confirms that nuScenes is a key dataset for their research.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide detailed information about their evaluation on the nuScenes benchmark. They mention that the nuScenes dataset consists of 1,000 scenes, with 700 for training and 150 for testing, and describe the nature of the data (point clouds, annotations, etc.). This section solidifies the importance of the nuScenes dataset in their work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the nuScenes dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **nuScenes Dataset**:
  > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.11027, 2019.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **nuScenes Dataset**: A large-scale dataset for 3D object detection, consisting of 1,000 scenes, with detailed annotations for various object classes.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
