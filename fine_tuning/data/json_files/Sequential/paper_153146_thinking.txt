To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Sequence to Sequence Voice Conversion with Limited Data" by Praveen Narayanan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, but the experimental setup is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of voice conversion and the need for large datasets. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and evaluation:

1. **LJSpeech Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 13,100 short utterances from a single female speaker reading passages from 7 audiobooks, totaling about 24 hours of audio. This dataset is used for pretraining the network.

2. **CMU Arctic Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,132 utterances from several speakers, specifically the male speakers "bdl" and "rms," and the female speakers "clb" and "slt." It is used for adapting the pretrained network to perform voice conversion.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **LJSpeech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > K. Ito, “The LJSpeech dataset,” 2017. [Online]. Available: https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/

- For the **CMU Arctic Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Kominek and A. W. Black, “CMU Arctic databases for speech synthesis,” Language Technology Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 2003. [Online]. Available: http://festvox.org/cmuarctic/index.html

With this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will be structured in a way that is ready for further processing or review.
