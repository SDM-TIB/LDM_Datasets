To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contextualized Rewriting for Text Summarization" by Guangsheng Bao and Yue Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on specific datasets, which is a good starting point.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset** for evaluation. This indicates that this dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their summarization model.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experimental setup**. In this paper, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their models on the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**, which consists of online news articles with human-written highlights.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Hermann, K. M., Kociský, T., Grefenstette, E., Espeholt, L., Kay, W., Suleyman, M., & Blunsom, P. (2015). Teaching Machines to Read and Comprehend. In Cortes, C.; Lawrence, N. D.; Lee, D. D.; Sugiyama, M.; & Garnett, R. (Eds.), Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28: Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2015, December 7-12, 2015, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, 1693–1701.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset** is the primary dataset used for the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citation, into a structured format for further processing or review.
