To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable Charge Predictions for Criminal Cases: Learning to Generate Court Views from Fact Descriptions" by Hai Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the task of generating court views from fact descriptions, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved, particularly in the context of legal documents.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation. In this section, the authors state that they constructed a dataset from published legal documents in China Judgements Online. This indicates that there is a specific dataset that has been created for their experiments.

I will look for details about this dataset in the **data preparation subsection**. Here, the authors describe how they extracted fact descriptions, rationales, and charge labels using regular expressions from legal documents. They provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of samples and the average number of tokens, which confirms the dataset's significance.

The paper mentions that they focused on cases with one defendant and one charge, which helps narrow down the dataset's characteristics. The authors also provide a link to the dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset mentioned in the paper. The dataset is constructed from legal documents available at the following source:

- **Dataset Citation**:
  > Luo, B., Feng, Y., Xu, J., Zhang, X., & Zhao, D. (2017). Learning to predict charges for criminal cases with legal basis. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 2717â€“2726).

Finally, I will summarize the dataset details, including its purpose, the type of data it contains, and any relevant statistics provided in the paper. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's context and significance in the research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format it according to the required structure for downstream processing.
