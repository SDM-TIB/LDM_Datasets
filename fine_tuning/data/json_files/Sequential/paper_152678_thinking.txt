To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Refined WaveNet Vocoder for Variational Autoencoder Based Voice Conversion" by Wen-Chin Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluations sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not specify datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in prior work, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluations section**. Here, the authors mention using the **Voice Conversion Challenge 2018 (VCC2018) corpus** for their experiments. This is a significant dataset, and I need to gather more details about it.

In the **experimental settings subsection**, the authors describe the VCC2018 corpus, which includes recordings from 12 professional US English speakers, specifying the number of utterances and the total training data length. This detailed description confirms that the VCC2018 corpus is indeed a dataset used in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VCC2018 corpus. The citation is as follows:
> J. Lorenzo-Trueba, J. Yamagishi, T. Toda, D. Saito, F. Villavicencio, T. Kinnunen, and Z. Ling. *The voice conversion challenge 2018: Promoting development of parallel and nonparallel methods*. In Proceedings of Odyssey, 2018, pages 195â€“202.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the VCC2018 corpus, including its citation, into the required format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
