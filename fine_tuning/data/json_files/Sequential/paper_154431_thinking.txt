To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Learning with Adversarial Perturbations for Conditional Text Generation" by Seanie Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method on three text generation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, particularly **section 4.1 (Tasks)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three tasks: machine translation, text summarization, and question generation. I will note the datasets associated with each task:

1. **WMT’16 Romanian-English Parallel Corpus**: Used for machine translation, with a training set of 610,320 pairs.
2. **XSum Dataset**: Used for text summarization, containing 204,045 examples.
3. **SQuAD Dataset**: Used for question generation, with 86,588 examples.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution.

For the **WMT’16 Romanian-English Parallel Corpus**, the citation is:
> Bojar, O., et al. *Findings of the 2016 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT16)*. In Proceedings of the First Conference on Machine Translation, pages 1-46, 2016.

For the **XSum Dataset**, the citation is:
> Narayan, S., et al. *Don’t Give Me the Details, Just the Summary! Topic-Aware Convolutional Neural Networks for Extreme Summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-10, 2018.

For the **SQuAD Dataset**, the citation is:
> Rajpurkar, P., et al. *SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-10, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
