To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards the Use of Neural Networks for Influenza Prediction at Multiple Spatial Resolutions" by Emily L. Aiken et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction discusses the context of influenza prediction and may hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methods)**, specifically the subsection titled **2.1 Datasets and Preprocessing**. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors describe two main datasets:

1. **State-level epidemiological dataset**: This dataset consists of CDC weekly ILI counts from October 4, 2009, to May 14, 2017, including data from 37 states without missing data.

2. **City-level epidemiological dataset**: Compiled by IMS Health, this dataset is based on weekly medical claims for 159 cities from January 1, 2004, to July 20, 2010.

Additionally, the authors mention extracting historical flu-related search activity from **Google Trends (GT)** for 256 keywords correlated with ILI incidence.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **CDC ILI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. *Disease burden of influenza*. Available at: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html (2018).

- For the **IMS Health dataset**, the citation is:
  > Viboud, C. et al. *Demonstrating the Use of High-Volume Electronic Medical Claims Data to Monitor Local and Regional Influenza Activity in the US*. PLOS One 9, e0102429 (2014).

- For **Google Trends**, the citation is:
  > Google Trends. Available at: https://trends.google.com/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
