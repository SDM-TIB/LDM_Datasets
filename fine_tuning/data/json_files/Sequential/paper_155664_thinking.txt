To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Attention GAN for Vehicle Motion Prediction" by Carlos Gómez-Huelamo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions validating the method using the **Argoverse Motion Forecasting Benchmark 1.1**, which indicates that this is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experimental results section**. In section IV, the authors provide a description of the **Argoverse Motion Forecasting dataset**, stating that it includes training, validation, and testing subsets, with a total of 205,942 training samples, 39,472 validation samples, and 78,143 test samples. Each sample has a length of 5 seconds, with an observation window of 2 seconds and a prediction window of 3 seconds.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Argoverse dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Argoverse Motion Forecasting dataset**, the citation is:
  > M.-F. Chang, J. Lambert, P. Sangkloy, J. Singh, S. Bak, A. Hartnett, D. Wang, P. Carr, S. Lucey, D. Ramanan, et al. "Argoverse: 3D tracking and forecasting with rich maps." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 8748–8757, 2019.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the key steps I followed were:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction to identify mentions of datasets.
2. Locate detailed descriptions of the datasets in the experimental results section.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
