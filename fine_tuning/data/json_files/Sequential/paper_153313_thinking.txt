To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "A Random Gossip BMUF Process for Neural Language Modeling" by Yiheng Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention applying their method to several LSTM language modeling tasks and refer to "two benchmark datasets." This indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for evaluation. They mention two datasets:

1. **WikiText-103**: This dataset contains 0.1 billion tokens for training, with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words replaced by `<unk>`. The vocabulary size is 267,735.

2. **Gutenberg**: The authors use 95% of this dataset for training and 5% for testing. The training corpus contains 0.13 billion tokens, with OOVs replaced by `<unk>`, and the vocabulary is truncated at a frequency of 7, totaling 280,811 words.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **WikiText-103**, the citation is:
  > Merity, S., Xiong, C. M., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2016). Pointer sentinel mixture models. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.07843*.

- For **Gutenberg**, the citation is:
  > Project Gutenberg. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.openslr.org/resources/12/original-books.tar.gz.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its respective citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent use of this information.
