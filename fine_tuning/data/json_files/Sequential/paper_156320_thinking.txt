To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Memory-Efficient Particle Filter Recurrent Neural Network for Object Localization" by Roman Korkin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted. The introduction will likely discuss the problem being addressed and may reference datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention generating trajectories for testing their model. I will look for details on how these trajectories were created, including any datasets or simulation environments referenced. The paper describes four environments: **world 10 × 10, World 18 × 18, WORLD 27 × 27, and Labyrinth**. I will note these as they represent the datasets used for the experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that are referenced. If the authors refer to existing datasets or methodologies, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

For the environments mentioned, I will compile the following dataset entries:

1. **World 10 × 10**: This environment is described as symmetric and challenging for object localization.
2. **World 18 × 18**: Another symmetric environment, also challenging for localization tasks.
3. **WORLD 27 × 27**: A larger symmetric environment that presents similar challenges.
4. **Labyrinth**: A non-symmetric environment that is medium challenging for filtering methods.

I will also ensure to include any relevant citations for these environments if they are derived from existing datasets or studies.

Finally, I will format the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and complete for future reference.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
