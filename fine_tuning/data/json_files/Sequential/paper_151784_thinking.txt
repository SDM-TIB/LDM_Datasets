To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Particle Smoothing for Sampling from Conditional Sequence Models" by Chu-Cheng Lin and Jason Eisner, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 6), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

Upon reviewing section 6, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **CMU Pronunciation Dictionary**: This dataset is used for the English stressed syllable tagging task. It provides sequences of phonemes and is referenced as follows:
   > Weide, R. (1998). *The CMU Pronunciation Dictionary, release 0.6*.

2. **Chinese Social Media NER Dataset**: This dataset is used for named entity recognition in Chinese. The authors reference the dataset from the following source:
   > Peng, N., & Dredze, M. (2015). *Named entity recognition for Chinese social media with jointly trained embeddings*. In EMNLP.

3. **Penn Treebank**: This dataset is used for the source separation task. The authors reference it as follows:
   > Marcus, M. P., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., & Santorini, B. (1993). *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2), 313-330.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper documentation and referencing.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
