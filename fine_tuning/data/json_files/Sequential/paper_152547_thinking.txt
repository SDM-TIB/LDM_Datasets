To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Reinforced Sequence-to-Set Model for Multi-Label Text Classification" by Pengcheng Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction discusses multi-label text classification but does not specify datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **RCV1-V2**: This dataset is described as consisting of over 800,000 manually categorized newswire stories with 103 topics. It is referenced as being provided by Lewis et al. (2004).

2. **AAPD (Arxiv Academic Paper Dataset)**: This dataset consists of abstracts and corresponding subjects of 55,840 academic papers, with a total of 54 subjects. It is referenced as being provided by Yang et al. (2018).

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper:

- For **RCV1-V2**, the citation is:
  > Lewis, D. D., Yang, Y., Rose, T. G., & Li, F. (2004). RCV1: A new benchmark collection for text categorization research. *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 5, 361-397.

- For **AAPD**, the citation is:
  > Yang, P., Sun, X., Li, W., Ma, S., Wu, W., & Wang, H. (2018). SGM: sequence generation model for multi-label classification. In *Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 2018)*, 3915-3926.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **RCV1-V2**
   - Citation: Lewis, D. D., Yang, Y., Rose, T. G., & Li, F. (2004). RCV1: A new benchmark collection for text categorization research. *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 5, 361-397.

2. **AAPD**
   - Citation: Yang, P., Sun, X., Li, W., Ma, S., Wu, W., & Wang, H. (2018). SGM: sequence generation model for multi-label classification. In *Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 2018)*, 3915-3926.

With this information, I am ready to proceed with any further processing or analysis required.
