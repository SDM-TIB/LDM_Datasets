To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LTG-Oslo Hierarchical Multi-task Network: The importance of negation for document-level sentiment in Spanish" by Jeremy Barnes, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but the details about datasets are likely to be found in the experimental setup.

In **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, I will focus on **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the author explicitly mentions the **SFU ReviewSP-NEG dataset**. This dataset is described as containing 400 Spanish-language reviews across eight domains, with annotations for negation cues, negation scope, and relevance to sentiment. This is a clear indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SFU ReviewSP-NEG dataset. The relevant citation is:

> Jiménez-Zafra, S. M., Taulé, M., Martín-Valdivia, M. T., Ureña-López, L. A., and Martí, M. A. (2018b). SFU ReviewSP-NEG: a Spanish corpus annotated with negation for sentiment analysis. A typology of negation patterns. *Language Resources and Evaluation*, 52(2):533–569.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Dataset Name**: SFU ReviewSP-NEG
   - **Description**: Contains 400 Spanish-language reviews from eight domains (books, cars, cellphones, computers, hotels, movies, music, and washing machines) with annotations for negation cues, negation scope, and relevance to sentiment.
   - **Citation**: Jiménez-Zafra, S. M., Taulé, M., Martín-Valdivia, M. T., Ureña-López, L. A., and Martí, M. A. (2018b). SFU ReviewSP-NEG: a Spanish corpus annotated with negation for sentiment analysis. A typology of negation patterns. *Language Resources and Evaluation*, 52(2):533–569.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
