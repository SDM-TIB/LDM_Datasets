To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vehicle Behavior Prediction and Generalization Using Imbalanced Learning Techniques" by Theodor Westny, Erik Frisk, and BjÃ¶rn Olofsson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used two distinct highway traffic recordings, specifically the **NGSIM US-101** and **I80 datasets**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look into **section III (Proposed Method)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for model training and evaluation. They state that the datasets are publicly available and provided by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), containing recorded highway traffic data captured at 10 Hz from both US-101 and I80. This section provides additional context about the datasets, such as their duration and the nature of the recordings.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors discuss the performance of their model using these datasets, which further confirms their significance in the research. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **US-101 Dataset**:
  > Colyar, J., & Halkias, J. (2007). *US Highway 101 Dataset*. Federal Highway Administration Research and Technology fact sheet. Publication number: FHWA-HRT-07-030. Retrieved from http://doi.org/10.21949/1504477.

- For the **I80 Dataset**:
  > Halkias, J., & Colyar, J. (2006). *Interstate 80 Freeway Dataset*. Federal Highway Administration Research and Technology fact sheet. Publication number: FHWA-HRT-06-137. Retrieved from http://doi.org/10.21949/1504477.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **NGSIM US-101 Dataset**: This dataset contains recorded highway traffic data captured at 10 Hz, providing 45 minutes of recordings divided into three 15-minute subsets simulating different traffic conditions.

2. **I80 Dataset**: Similar to the US-101 dataset, this dataset also contains recorded highway traffic data at 10 Hz, with the same structure of 45 minutes of recordings divided into subsets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
