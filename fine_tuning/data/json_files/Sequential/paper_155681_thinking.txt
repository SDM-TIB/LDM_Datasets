To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Encoder-Decoder RNNs for Bus Arrival Time Prediction" by Nancy Bhutani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the effectiveness of the proposed architecture is demonstrated on real field data collected from challenging traffic conditions. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **results** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the data input in **Section III (Methodology)**, specifically in **Section III-A (Data Preliminaries)**. Here, they mention that the data consists of travel times experienced across sections of a bus route in Delhi, which is crucial for understanding the dataset used.

The paper states that the data was collected from a bus route in Delhi, segmented uniformly into sections, and includes travel times from Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data captured via GPS sensing. This provides a clear indication of the dataset's nature and source.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that the data was shared by Prof. Pravesh Biyani and his team from IIIT Delhi, and they note that the data is available on request. However, they do not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself, which is common in research papers that utilize proprietary or unpublished datasets.

Since the dataset is based on real field data from Delhi, I will document it as follows:

1. **Bus Arrival Time Prediction Dataset**: This dataset consists of travel times collected from a bus route in Delhi, segmented into sections of 800 meters. The data includes both dwell time at bus stops and running time across sections, obtained from AVL data captured via GPS.

The citation for the dataset is not formally provided in the paper, but I will reference the acknowledgment of the data source:

> Acknowledgment: The authors thank Prof. Pravesh Biyani and his team from IIIT Delhi for kindly sharing real field AVL data, which made our benchmarking possible. This data is available on request for anyone.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the information gathered, ensuring to include the acknowledgment as the citation for the dataset.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and structured entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for any further processing or documentation.
