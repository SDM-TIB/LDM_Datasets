To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTM-Based Adaptive Vehicle Position Control for Dynamic Wireless Charging" by Lokesh Chandra Das et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Dataset Preparation)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for training and testing their LSTM model. Here, they mention that the dataset is collected from simulations conducted under specific conditions. They detail how electromagnetic strength is measured at various points, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

In this section, the authors explain that the dataset consists of feature vectors that include time steps, electromagnetic strength, and coordinates of points with maximum electromagnetic strength. This information is essential for defining the dataset's characteristics.

Now, I will look for any references to the dataset's source or any related publications in the **References section**. However, in this case, the dataset appears to be generated from simulations rather than sourced from an external dataset. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is original to this study.

Since the dataset is not publicly available or cited from another source, I will create a citation for the dataset based on the paper itself. The citation will include the authors, title, and publication details.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Lokesh Chandra Das, Dipankar Dasgupta, and Myounggyu Won. *LSTM-Based Adaptive Vehicle Position Control for Dynamic Wireless Charging*. Preprint. Under review.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including its description and citation, into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's details as presented in the paper.
