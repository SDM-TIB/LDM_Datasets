To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Short-Term Forecasting COVID-19 Cases In Turkey Using Long Short-Term Memory Network" by Selahattin Serdar Helli et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study uses COVID-19 data for 30 days to forecast the next fifteen days, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of forecasting COVID-19 cases but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then focus on **section II (Method)**, particularly the **Dataset** subsection. Here, the authors explicitly mention that they used the official total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths reported by the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health between March 11, 2020, and May 8, 2020. This is a clear identification of the dataset used in the study.

To ensure I have all necessary details, I will also check the **Appendix** for any links or additional information about the dataset. The authors provide a link to their GitHub repository, which contains the datasets and source codes used in the study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The dataset is sourced from the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health, and the citation for this source is:
> Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health. “COVID-19 Daily Situation Report” – obtained from https://covid19.saglik.gov.tr/.

Since this is the primary dataset used in the study, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work or analysis.
