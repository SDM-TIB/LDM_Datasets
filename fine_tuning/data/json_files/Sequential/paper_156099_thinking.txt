To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring the Promise and Limits of Real-Time Recurrent Learning" by Kazuki Irie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors tested their methods in "several subsets of DMLab-30, ProcGen, and Atari-2600 environments." This indicates that these environments are likely datasets or benchmarks used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets. In this section, the authors specifically mention:

1. **DMLab-30**: A collection of 30 first-person 3D game environments, which includes memory tasks like "rooms select nonmatching object" and "rooms watermaze." This suggests that DMLab-30 is a significant dataset used for their experiments.

2. **ProcGen**: The authors refer to this as a benchmark for reinforcement learning, specifically mentioning the "Chaser" environment. This indicates that ProcGen is another dataset utilized in their research.

3. **Atari-2600**: The authors mention using five Atari environments, including "Breakout," "Gravitar," "MsPacman," "Q*bert," and "Seaquest." This confirms that these games are part of the datasets they evaluated their methods on.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DMLab-30**, the citation is:
  > Charles Beattie, Joel Z Leibo, Denis Teplyashin, Tom Ward, Marcus Wainwright, Heinrich Küttler, Andrew Lefrancq, Simon Green, Víctor Valdés, Amir Sadik, et al. *DeepMind Lab*. Preprint arXiv:1612.03801, 2016.

- For **ProcGen**, the citation is:
  > Karl Cobbe, Christopher Hesse, Jacob Hilton, and John Schulman. *Leveraging Procedural Generation to Benchmark Reinforcement Learning*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pp. 2048–2056, Virtual only, July 2020.

- For **Atari-2600**, the citation is:
  > Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253–279, 2013.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
