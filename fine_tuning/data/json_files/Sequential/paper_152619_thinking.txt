To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Source-Filter-Based Waveform Model for Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesis" by Xin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it often highlights the context in which they are used. The introduction typically elaborates on the background and may reference specific datasets used in prior research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section is crucial as it usually details the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using a **Japanese speech corpus** for their experiments. I will note the specifics of this corpus, including the number of utterances and any relevant details about the data collection process.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For instance, if the authors refer to a specific corpus or dataset, I will ensure to locate the original source to provide an accurate citation.

For the **Japanese speech corpus**, I will find the citation as follows:
- The citation for the corpus used in this study is:
  > Hisashi Kawai, Tomoki Toda, Jinfu Ni, Minoru Tsuzaki, and Keiichi Tokuda. *XIMERA: A new TTS from ATR based on corpus-based technologies*. In Proceedings of SSW5, 2004, pp. 179â€“184.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
