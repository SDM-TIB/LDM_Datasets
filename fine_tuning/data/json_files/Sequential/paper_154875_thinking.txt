To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COBERL: Contrastive BERT for Reinforcement Learning" by Andrea Banino et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that COBERL improves data efficiency across various environments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention testing COBERL across the **Atari suite**, the **DeepMind Control Suite**, and **DMLab-30**. These are likely the datasets I need to extract.

I will then look for specific details about each dataset:

1. **Atari Suite**: The authors refer to the **57 Atari games** used for evaluation. I will need to note that this is a collection of games rather than a single dataset, but it is important to mention it as a dataset used in their experiments.

2. **DeepMind Control Suite**: The authors mention using this suite for testing COBERL. I will need to find the full citation for this suite.

3. **DMLab-30**: Similarly, this is another suite mentioned in the experiments. I will also look for its citation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Atari Suite**, the citation is:
  > Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253–279, 2013.

- For the **DeepMind Control Suite**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Tassa, Yotam Doron, Alistair Muldal, Tom Erez, Yazhe Li, Diego de Las Casas, David Budden, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Josh Merel, Andrew Lefrancq, et al. *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690, 2018.

- For **DMLab-30**, the citation is:
  > Charles Beattie, Joel Z Leibo, Denis Teplyashin, Tom Ward, Marcus Wainwright, Heinrich Küttler, Andrew Lefrancq, Simon Green, Víctor Valdés, Amir Sadik, et al. *DeepMind Lab*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1612.03801, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
