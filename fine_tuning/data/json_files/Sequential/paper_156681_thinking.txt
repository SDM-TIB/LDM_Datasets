To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparative Analysis of Neural Network Architectures for Short-Term FOREX Forecasting" by Theodoros Zafeiriou and Dimitris Kalles, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on neural network architectures for FOREX forecasting, which suggests that there may be specific datasets used for this analysis.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the importance of short-term forecasting in the FOREX market, but I need to find specific datasets used in their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in **section 3.1 (Selection of the Exchange rate and experimental data source)**, the authors mention that they used the **EUR/USD exchange rate** data for their experiments. They specify that the data was sourced from **TrueFX** and **American Integral**, which are recognized as industry-leading exchange rate data servers. This indicates that the datasets are related to tick-to-tick exchange rate values.

The authors also mention that the experimental data pertains to the months of **October, November, and December 2021**, and that it initially comprised over **10 million values**. This detail is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the data sources are as follows:

- For **TrueFX**, the citation is:
  > TrueFX. www.truefx.com.

- For **American Integral**, the citation is:
  > Integral. www.integral.com.

Since these are the primary sources of the dataset used in the study, I will ensure to include them in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as specified. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
