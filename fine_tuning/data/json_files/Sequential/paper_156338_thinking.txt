To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Transformer Network for Flood Forecasting with Heterogeneous Covariates" by Jimeng Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their FloodGTN tool to data from the South Florida Water Management District, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the data used. They mention obtaining data from the **South Florida Water Management Districtâ€™s (SFWMD) DBHydro database**. This is a specific dataset that records hourly observations for water levels and external covariates from 2010 to 2020. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its temporal coverage and the types of measurements it includes.

In the **methodology section**, the authors discuss the inputs used for their model, which include water levels and external covariates such as rainfall and tide. This reinforces the importance of the SFWMD dataset in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the SFWMD DBHydro database, which is crucial for proper citation. The citation is as follows:
> South Florida Water Management District. Dbhydro of south florida water management district. https://www.sfwmd.gov/science-data/dbhydro.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the SFWMD dataset.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the SFWMD dataset, ensuring it is ready for any further processing or review.
