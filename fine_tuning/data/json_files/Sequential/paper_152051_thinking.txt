To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Speaker-Independent Lipreading with Domain-Adversarial Training" by Michael Wand and Jürgen Schmidhuber, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their lipreading system on a specific dataset, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors mention the GRID corpus as the dataset used for their experiments. This is a clear indication that I need to gather more details about this dataset.

In **section 3 (Data and preprocessing)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the GRID corpus. They explain that it consists of video and audio recordings from 34 speakers, each saying 1000 sentences. The sentences have a fixed structure, and the authors also describe how the data is segmented and processed. This section confirms that the GRID corpus is indeed the dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the GRID corpus. The relevant citation is:
> M. Cooke, J. Barker, S. Cunningham, and X. Shao. *An Audio-Visual Corpus for Speech Perception and Automatic Speech Recognition*. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, vol. 120, no. 5, pp. 2421 – 2424, 2006.

Since the authors do not mention any other datasets in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

The only dataset extracted from this paper is the GRID corpus, and I will ensure to include its full citation in the final output.
