To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting the ConvLSTM: Human Action Recognition using Raw Depth Video-Based Recurrent Neural Networks" by Adrian Sanchez-Caballero et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **NTU RGB+D dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the significance of large-scale datasets for deep learning in human action recognition, specifically mentioning the **NTU RGB+D dataset** as a key resource for their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in **section 4 (Training stage)**, the authors provide detailed information about the NTU RGB+D dataset. They describe its characteristics, including that it contains 56,880 samples of videos recorded with Microsoft Kinect II sensors, covering 60 human actions across various categories. This section confirms that the NTU RGB+D dataset is indeed the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the NTU RGB+D dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> A. Shahroudy, J. Liu, T.-T. Ng, and G. Wang. *NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 1010–1019, 2016.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: NTU RGB+D
   - **Description**: A large-scale dataset containing 56,880 samples of videos recorded with Microsoft Kinect II sensors, featuring 60 human actions categorized into daily actions, medical conditions, and mutual actions.
   - **Citation**: A. Shahroudy, J. Liu, T.-T. Ng, and G. Wang. *NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 1010–1019, 2016.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis, ensuring that the citation is included for proper referencing.
