To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Developing a Multi-variate Prediction Model For The Detection of COVID-19 From Crowd-sourced Respiratory Voice Data" by Wafaa Aljbawi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a dataset from Cambridge University, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methods)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that they used the **Cambridge University dataset**, which consists of **893 audio samples** collected from **4,352 participants** through a COVID-19 Sounds app. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their research.

In this section, they provide additional details about the dataset, including the number of COVID-19 positive samples (308) and the demographics of the participants. This information is essential for accurately describing the dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Cambridge University dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the **Cambridge University dataset**, the citation is:
  > Brown, C., Chauhan, J., Grammenos, A., Han, J., Hasthanasombat, A., Spathis, D., Xia, T., Cicuta, P., & Mascolo, C. (2020). Exploring automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 from crowdsourced respiratory sound data. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.05919*.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is critical for proper attribution.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Cambridge University dataset, ensuring that it is clear and concise, ready for inclusion in any further analysis or reporting.
