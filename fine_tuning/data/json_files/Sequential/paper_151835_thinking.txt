To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stacked Neural Networks for End-to-End Ciliary Motion Analysis" by Charles Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, while the introduction often contextualizes the research and may reference specific datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will examine the **data section** (section 2) closely, as it is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets utilized in the study. In this section, the authors mention using data from their previous work, which includes nasal brush biopsies from 75 patients, totaling 268 videos. This indicates that the dataset is related to ciliary motion analysis and is derived from clinical samples.

I will also look for any specific names or identifiers for the dataset. The authors describe the collection process and the types of patients involved (35 healthy controls and 40 with diagnosed ciliopathies), which is important for understanding the dataset's context.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the original dataset or any related studies that may have contributed to the dataset's creation. The authors reference their previous work, which is crucial for providing a complete citation.

The relevant citation for the dataset mentioned in the paper is:
> Quinn, S., Zahid, M.J., Durkin, J.R., Francis, R.J., Lo, C.W., Chennubhotla, S.C. "Automated identification of abnormal respiratory ciliary motion in nasal biopsies." *Science Translational Medicine*, 7(299), pp. 299ra124â€“299ra124, 2015.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details, including the number of patients, the types of videos collected, and the clinical context.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
