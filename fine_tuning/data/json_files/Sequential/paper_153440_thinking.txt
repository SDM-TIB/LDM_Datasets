To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LSTM-Sharp: An Adaptable, Energy-Efficient Hardware Accelerator for Long Short-Term Memory" by Reza Yazdani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract discusses the performance of LSTM-Sharp but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction provides context about LSTM networks but also lacks explicit dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section VIII) closely, as this is typically where datasets used for evaluation are detailed. I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics or characteristics.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors mention evaluating LSTM-Sharp against various benchmarks, but they do not specify any datasets directly. Instead, they refer to LSTM models used in popular applications such as machine comprehension, language modeling, speech recognition, and machine translation. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or details.

Since no explicit datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will check the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets that could be relevant. I will look for papers that might describe datasets used in the context of LSTM networks or similar applications.

After reviewing the references, I find several papers that may contain datasets relevant to LSTM applications. I will extract the full citations for these papers, as they may provide datasets that can be used in conjunction with the findings of this research.

Here are the relevant citations I will document:

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will compile the citations of these relevant works, as they may lead to datasets that can be utilized in conjunction with the findings of LSTM-Sharp.

In conclusion, I will document the citations of the relevant papers that may contain datasets related to the applications discussed in the LSTM-Sharp paper, ensuring that I have full citations for each dataset reference.
