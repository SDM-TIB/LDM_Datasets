To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Precisely the Point: Adversarial Augmentations for Faithful and Informative Text Generation" by Wenhao Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three popular text generation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **XSum**: A dataset for text summarization, which consists of 204,045 training samples, 11,332 validation samples, and 11,334 test samples. The dataset is referenced as:
   > Nallapati, R., Zhou, B., Santos, C. N. D., & Xiang, B. (2016). Abstractive text summarization using sequence-to-sequence RNNs and beyond. In Proceedings of the 20th SIGNLL Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2016), Berlin, Germany, August 11-12, 2016, pages 280–290. ACL.

2. **CNN/DM**: Another dataset for text summarization, with 287,227 training samples, 13,368 validation samples, and 11,490 test samples. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Hermann, K. M., Kocisky, T., Grefenstette, E., Espeholt, L., Kay, W., Suleyman, M., & Blunsom, P. (2015). Teaching machines to read and comprehend. Advances in neural information processing systems, 28:1693–1701.

3. **WIKIPERSON**: A dataset for table-to-text generation, containing 250,186 training samples, 30,487 validation samples, and 29,982 test samples. The citation is:
   > Wang, Q., Pan, X., Huang, L., Zhang, B., Jiang, H., & Knight, K. (2018). Describing a knowledge base. In Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Natural Language Generation, pages 10–21, Tilburg University, The Netherlands. ACL.

4. **Dialogue NLI**: A dataset for dialogue generation, with 10,013 training samples, 968 validation samples, and 12,376 test samples. The citation is:
   > Welleck, S., Weston, J., Szlam, A., & Cho, K. (2019). Dialogue natural language inference. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 3731–3741, Florence, Italy. ACL.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their respective citations accurately, as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format for easy access and review.
