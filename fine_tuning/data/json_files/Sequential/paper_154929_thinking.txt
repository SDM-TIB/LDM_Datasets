To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Joint Embedding with Modality Alignments for Cross-Modal Retrieval of Recipes and Food Images" by Zhongwei Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments with the **Recipe1M benchmark dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** more closely, specifically looking for any detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their approach on the **Recipe1M dataset**, which consists of over 800,000 recipes and 1 million associated food images. This confirms that Recipe1M is the primary dataset utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if there are any other datasets mentioned that might have been used in previous studies referenced by the authors. However, the focus remains on the Recipe1M dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the Recipe1M dataset. The authors cite the original paper that introduced this dataset, which is:

- For **Recipe1M dataset**:
  > Salvador, A., Hynes, N., Aytar, Y., Marin, J., Ofli, F., Weber, I., & Torralba, A. (2017). Learning cross-modal embeddings for cooking recipes and food images. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR), 3020â€“3028.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for Recipe1M, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
