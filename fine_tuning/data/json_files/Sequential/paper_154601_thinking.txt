To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatio-Temporal Data Mining for Aviation Delay Prediction" by Kai Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of accurate flight delay prediction and mention the use of historical trajectories from ADS-B messages. This indicates that there are datasets related to flight data and possibly others.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Methodology)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets:

1. **Flight Data**: This dataset includes flight records provided by the United States Department of Transportation, containing essential information such as departure/arrival airports, scheduled and actual departure/arrival times, and airlines.

2. **Trajectory Data**: This dataset is collected from ADS-B technology, which includes aircraft identification, position information (longitude, latitude, altitude), flight status, and aircraft attributes.

3. **ATC Data**: This dataset includes information from air route traffic control centers (ARTCCs), detailing staffing and controller training times, sourced from 123ATC.

4. **Weather Data**: This dataset consists of local climatological data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which includes temperature, precipitation, humidity, and other weather-related factors.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not be explicitly listed for the datasets themselves, but I can infer them based on the sources mentioned in the methodology:

- For **ADS-B Data**, the citation is:
  > ADS-B Exchange. *Worldâ€™s largest co-op of unfiltered flight data*. Available: https://www.adsbexchange.com/

- For **ATC Data**, the citation is:
  > 123ATC. *Available: https://123atc.com/*

- For **Local Climatological Data**, the citation is:
  > National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). *Available: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/*

- For **Flight Data**, the citation is:
  > United States Department of Transportation. *Available: https://www.transportation.gov/*

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
