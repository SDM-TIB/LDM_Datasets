To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distilling BERT for low complexity network training" by Bansidhar P.M., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper studies sentiment analysis on the **SST-2 dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the datasets. The introduction references the SST-2 dataset and mentions comparisons with other datasets like SST-5, but it primarily focuses on SST-2 for sentiment classification.

In **section 4.1 (Data)**, the paper provides a detailed description of the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)** dataset, specifically focusing on SST-2. It outlines the dataset's structure, including the number of training, development, and test samples, as well as the class distribution. This section confirms that SST-2 is the primary dataset used for the experiments.

I will also check the **experiments** section to ensure that SST-2 is indeed the dataset used for evaluation, which it is, as the results are based on this dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the SST-2 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2013). *Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1631â€“1642.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly used for training or evaluation, I will conclude that the SST-2 dataset is the only dataset to extract.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation for SST-2, ready for any structured output or further processing.
