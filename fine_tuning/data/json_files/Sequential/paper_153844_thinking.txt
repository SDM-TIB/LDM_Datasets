To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DomBERT: Domain-oriented Language Model for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis" by Hu Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on tasks in aspect-based sentiment analysis, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of domain-specific language models, hinting at the use of specific datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 4.1 (End Task Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets they used for aspect extraction (AE) and aspect sentiment classification (ASC). They refer to the **SemEval 2014 Task 4** for laptops and **SemEval 2016 Task 5** for restaurants, providing a clear indication of the datasets involved.

I will also look for any tables that summarize the datasets, such as **Table 2** and **Table 3**, which provide statistics on the datasets used for AE and ASC. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' structure and the number of examples they contain.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the SemEval datasets mentioned. The citations for these datasets are typically included in the references, and I will ensure to extract them accurately.

The citations I need to retrieve are:

- For **SemEval 2014 Task 4**:
  > *SemEval 2014 Task 4: Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2014), pages 1-2, 2014.

- For **SemEval 2016 Task 5**:
  > *SemEval 2016 Task 5: Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2016), pages 1-2, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining a focus on clarity and accuracy in the representation of the datasets extracted from the paper.
