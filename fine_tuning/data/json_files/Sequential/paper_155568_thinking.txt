To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Quality-aware Dynamic Memory for Video Object Segmentation" by Yong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both **DAVIS** and **YouTube-VOS** benchmarks, indicating that these are likely the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section, the authors compare their method against various benchmarks, specifically mentioning **DAVIS 2016**, **DAVIS 2017**, and **YouTube-VOS**. This confirms that these datasets are utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **DAVIS 2016**: The citation is:
   > Perazzi, F., Pont-Tuset, J., McWilliams, B., Gool, L.V., Gross, M.H., & Sorkine-Hornung, A. (2016). *A benchmark dataset and evaluation methodology for video object segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 724â€“732.

2. **DAVIS 2017**: The citation is:
   > Pont-Tuset, J., Perazzi, F., Caelles, S., Arbelaez, P., Sorkine-Hornung, A., & Gool, L.V. (2017). *The 2017 DAVIS challenge on video object segmentation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.00675.

3. **YouTube-VOS**: The citation is:
   > Xu, N., Yang, L., Fan, Y., Yue, D., Liang, Y., Yang, J., & Huang, T.S. (2018). *YouTube-VOS: A large-scale video object segmentation benchmark*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.03327.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.
