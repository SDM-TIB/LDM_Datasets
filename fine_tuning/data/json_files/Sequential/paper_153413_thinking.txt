To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search" by Li Lyna Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on **ImageNet** and **OUI-Adience-Age datasets**, which indicates that these datasets are likely used in the research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors state that they conducted comprehensive experiments on **ImageNet 2012** and **OUI-Adience-Age** datasets. This confirms that both datasets are integral to their research.

In the **experiments setup** subsection, the authors provide specific details about how they split the **ImageNet** dataset into training and validation sets, which further emphasizes its role in their experiments. They mention using 50,000 images for validation and the rest for training, which is important information to capture.

For the **OUI-Adience-Age dataset**, the authors describe it as a small 8-class dataset consisting of 17,000 face images, which they split into training and testing sets by an 80-20 ratio. This detail is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

2. For **OUI-Adience-Age**, the citation is:
   > Eran Eldinger, Roee Enbar, and Tal Hassner. *Age and Gender Estimation of Unfiltered Faces*. In TIFS, 2014.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
