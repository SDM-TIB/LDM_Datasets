To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrating Discrete and Neural Features via Mixed-Feature Trans-Dimensional Random Field Language Models" by Silin Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that various language models (LMs) were trained over the **PTB** and **Google one-billion-word datasets**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5, the authors describe two sets of experiments conducted over two training datasets:

1. **Penn Treebank (PTB) Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing about 1 million words and is used for training various LMs. The authors specify that they split the data sections for training, development, and testing.

2. **Google One-Billion-Word Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing approximately 0.8 billion words and is used for rescoring the WSJâ€™92 1000-best lists. The authors mention that they use a vocabulary of about 568,000 words after mapping infrequent words to a special token.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Penn Treebank (PTB) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mitchell Marcus, Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. 1993.

- For the **Google One-Billion-Word Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ciprian Chelba, Tomas Mikolov, Mike Schuster, Qi Ge, Thorsten Brants, Phillipp Koehn, and Tony Robinson. *One billion word benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.3005, 2013.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset according to the required format. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.
