To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty Set Prediction of Aggregated Wind Power Generation based on Bayesian LSTM and Spatio-Temporal Analysis" by Xiaopeng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that the study is based on actual data from 6 wind farms in northwest China, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Experiment)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors specify that they used a wind power generation dataset collected from 6 wind farms with a 15-minute sampling rate from January 1, 2018, to March 26, 2019. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the number of data points (43,164 pieces of data per wind farm) and the methodology for splitting the data into training and testing sets.

I will also look for any references to the dataset in the **references section** to find full citations. However, in this case, the dataset appears to be original data collected by the authors, so there may not be an external citation. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper itself.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Wind Power Generation Dataset**: This dataset includes the wind power generation data from 6 wind farms located in northwest China, recorded at a 15-minute interval over a period of approximately 14 months. The dataset consists of 43,164 data points for each wind farm.

Since the dataset is original and does not have an external citation, I will document the details as provided in the paper. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that captures all the relevant information, ensuring that I include the citation for the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Xiaopeng Li, Jiang Wu, Zhanbo Xu, Kun Liu, Jun Yu, and Xiaohong Guan. *Uncertainty Set Prediction of Aggregated Wind Power Generation based on Bayesian LSTM and Spatio-Temporal Analysis*. 

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
