To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diagonal RNNs in Symbolic Music Modeling" by Y. Cem Subakan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on "four standard symbolic music datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the **experiments section**, the authors list the datasets in the order of increasing size: **JSB Chorales**, **Piano-Midi**, **Nottingham**, and **MuseData**. This provides me with the names of the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The authors mention that the datasets were downloaded from a specific URL, which leads me to the original source of the datasets. The reference they cite for the datasets is:

- **Boulanger-Lewandowski et al. (2012)**: This paper is the original source for the datasets used in their experiments. The citation is:
  > N. Boulanger-Lewandowski, Y. Bengio, and P. Vincent. *Modeling temporal dependencies in high-dimensional sequences: Application to polyphonic music generation and transcription*. In Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2012.

Since the authors used these datasets for their experiments, I will include this citation for each dataset.

Now, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **JSB Chorales**: A dataset of chorales in symbolic music format.
2. **Piano-Midi**: A dataset containing MIDI files of piano music.
3. **Nottingham**: A dataset of symbolic music representing various pieces.
4. **MuseData**: A dataset that includes a collection of classical music scores in symbolic format.

For each dataset, I will use the citation from the Boulanger-Lewandowski et al. (2012) paper since it is the authoritative source for these datasets.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset names and their corresponding citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
