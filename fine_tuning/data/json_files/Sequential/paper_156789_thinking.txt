To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advancing Automated Deception Detection: A Multimodal Approach to Feature Extraction and Analysis" by Mohamed Bahaa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, which hints at the use of datasets for training and evaluating deception detection models.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used in their study. Here, they detail the composition of the dataset, which includes:

1. **Videos**: The dataset consists of 121 videos, with 61 labeled as deceptive and 60 as truthful. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

2. **Audio**: Each video is accompanied by an audio file in WAV format, totaling 121 audio files. This indicates that the dataset is multimodal, combining visual and auditory data.

3. **Text**: The dataset includes 121 text files, which are transcripts of the spoken content in the videos. This adds another layer of data for analysis.

4. **Frames**: The videos collectively consist of 82,575 frames, which are extracted for visual feature analysis. This detail is important for understanding the depth of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it is a custom dataset collected from real-life courtroom trials. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is original and does not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets.

In summary, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring to highlight that it is an original dataset collected for this research. The dataset details will include the number of videos, audio files, text transcripts, and frames, along with a note that it is not formally cited in the references.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are included.
