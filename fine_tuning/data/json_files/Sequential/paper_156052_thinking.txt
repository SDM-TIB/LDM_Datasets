To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Token-level Fitting Issues of Seq2seq Models" by Guangsheng Bao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using English-German benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. However, I need to find the specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **News Commentary v11**: This dataset is used for training and contains 236,287 sentence pairs. The authors specify that it is part of the English-German machine translation task.

2. **Europarl v7**: This dataset is also used for comparison and contains 1,666,904 sentence pairs for training. The authors follow a specific splitting method for the train, validation, and test sets.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For **News Commentary v11**, the citation is:
  > T. Kocmi and O. Bojar. *Curriculum learning and minibatch bucketing in neural machine translation*. In Proceedings of the International Conference Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing, RANLP 2017, pages 379–386, 2017.

- For **Europarl v7**, the citation is:
  > P. Koehn et al. *Moses: Open source toolkit for statistical machine translation*. In Proceedings of the 45th annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics companion volume proceedings of the demo and poster sessions, pages 177–180, 2007.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
