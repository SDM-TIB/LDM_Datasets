To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Averaging Spatio-temporal Signals using Optimal Transport and Soft Alignments" by Hicham Janati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions experiments on **handwritten letters** and **brain imaging data**, indicating that these are potential datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their methodology and the datasets they utilized. They specifically mention:

1. **DS117 Dataset**: This dataset is used for brain imaging data and is referenced as being from Wakeman and Henson (2015). It involves EEG/MEG data collected from subjects shown images of human faces.

2. **Handwritten Letters Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being publicly available and involves tracking the position of a pen during handwriting, as described in Williams et al. (2006).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **DS117 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D.G. Wakeman and R.N.A. Henson. *A multi-subject, multi-modal human neuroimaging dataset*. Scientific Data, 2(150001), 2015.

- For the **Handwritten Letters Dataset**, the citation is:
  > B.H. Williams, M. Toussaint, and A.J. Storkey. *Extracting motion primitives from natural handwriting data*. In ICANN, volume 2, page 634â€“643, 2006.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
