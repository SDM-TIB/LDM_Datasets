To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic non-invasive Cough Detection based on Accelerometer and Audio Signals" by Madhurananda Pahar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors compiled a manually-annotated dataset containing approximately 6000 cough and 68000 non-cough events from 14 adult male patients. This suggests that a specific dataset is being referenced.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Dataset Preparation)**, particularly **subsection 2.3 (Final Dataset)**, where the authors provide a summary of the dataset. Here, they confirm the dataset consists of approximately 6000 cough events and 68000 non-cough events, detailing the average lengths and total times for both types of events. This section is crucial as it provides quantitative details about the dataset.

I will also look at **section 2.2 (Data annotation)**, which describes the process of data collection and annotation, including the use of ceiling-mounted cameras and the multimedia software tool ELAN for manual annotation. This information is relevant for understanding the dataset's context and quality.

To ensure I have the full citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference their previous work, which likely includes the dataset they compiled. The relevant citation is:

- Pahar, M., Miranda, I., Diacon, A., & Niesler, T. (2021). Deep Neural Network based Cough Detection using Bed-mounted Accelerometer Measurements. In ICASSP 2021 - 2021 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) (pp. 8002â€“8006). IEEE.

This citation indicates that the dataset is associated with their previous study, which is essential for proper attribution.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Cough Detection Dataset**: This dataset includes approximately 6000 cough events and 68000 non-cough events, collected from 14 adult male patients in a tuberculosis clinic. The dataset is manually annotated and includes both accelerometer and audio signals.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
