To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pedestrian Motion State Estimation From 2D Pose" by Fei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is verified on the **JAAD public dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. Here, I will look for any additional context or details about the JAAD dataset that might help in understanding its significance or specific characteristics.

In the **experiments and results** section, I will focus on the part where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. This section typically provides detailed information about the dataset, including its properties, the number of samples, and how it was utilized in the study. The authors mention that the JAAD dataset consists of annotated short video clips representing urban driving scenarios, which is essential for understanding the dataset's application.

I will also check the **metrics** section to see if there are any specific metrics related to the dataset that could provide further insights into its use in the experiments.

After gathering information from these sections, I will refer to the **references** section to find the full citation for the JAAD dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset.

The citation for the JAAD dataset is:
> Rasouli A, Kotseruba I, Tsotsos J K. *Are they going to cross? A benchmark dataset and baseline for pedestrian crosswalk behavior*. Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision. 2017: 206-213.

Now, I will summarize the findings about the dataset:

1. **JAAD Dataset**: This dataset is used for studying joint attention in the context of autonomous driving, focusing on pedestrian and driver behaviors at crossing points. It includes over 300 video clips collected under various weather conditions, with a total of 82,000 frames.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
