To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Focus Attention: Promoting Faithfulness and Diversity in Summarization" by Rahul Aralikatte et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed methods on the **BBC extreme summarization task**, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe their evaluation methods. Here, they explicitly mention using the **XSUM dataset** for extreme summarization tasks. This section provides details about the dataset, including the number of document-summary pairs used for training, validation, and testing.

In addition to the XSUM dataset, I will also check the **appendices** for any additional datasets mentioned. The paper references the **CNN/DailyMail dataset** in the context of summarization tasks, which is another important dataset to note.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **XSUM Dataset**:
   > Shashi Narayan, Shay B. Cohen, and Mirella Lapata. *Don’t give me the details, just the summary! topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1797–1807, Brussels, Belgium, 2018.

2. **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**:
   > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28, pages 1693–1701, 2015.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
