To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequence-to-sequence Pre-training with Data Augmentation for Sentence Rewriting" by Yi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions evaluating the approach on well-recognized sentence rewriting benchmarks, which suggests that specific datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, particularly in subsections that detail the evaluation metrics and datasets used. In this paper, the authors discuss two main tasks: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and Formality Style Transfer (FST). 

In the **GEC Evaluation** subsection, the authors mention using the following datasets:

1. **CoNLL-2014**: This dataset contains 1,312 test sentences and is a well-known benchmark for grammatical error correction.
2. **JFLEG**: This dataset consists of 747 test sentences and is another recognized benchmark for GEC.

In the **FST Evaluation** subsection, the authors refer to the **GYAFC** dataset, which contains 110K annotated informal-formal parallel sentences, specifically focusing on two domains: Entertainment & Music (E&M) and Family & Relationships (F&R).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CoNLL-2014**, the citation is:

- For **JFLEG**, the citation is:

- For **GYAFC**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
