To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Textual Normalization for Hate Speech Detection" by Anh Thi-Hoang Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and dataset creation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors provide a dataset for textual normalization, which is a good starting point.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of social media text and the need for normalization, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will continue to the **dataset creation section**.

In **section 3 (Dataset Creation)**, the authors describe their dataset in detail. They mention that they created a dataset consisting of **2,181 human-annotated comments** specifically for the task of normalizing Vietnamese social media text. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, they reference the **ViHSD dataset** from which they extracted comments. The ViHSD dataset contains **33,400 comments** labeled as HATE, OFFENSIVE, or CLEAN, and they specifically used the first **3,400 comments** from the training set for their normalization task.

Now, I will look for the full citations for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper.

1. For the **ViHSD dataset**, the citation is:
   > Luu, S.T., Nguyen, K.V., Nguyen, N.L.T. *A large-scale dataset for hate speech detection on Vietnamese social media texts*. In Advances and Trends in Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence Practices. pp. 415â€“426. Springer International Publishing, Cham (2021).

2. The authors do not provide a separate citation for their newly created dataset, but they mention that it is accessible for research purposes via a GitHub link. I will note this as it is relevant for anyone looking to access the dataset.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Dataset 1**: The dataset created by the authors for textual normalization, consisting of 2,181 human-annotated comments.
- **Dataset 2**: The ViHSD dataset, which the authors used to extract comments for their study.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or use.
