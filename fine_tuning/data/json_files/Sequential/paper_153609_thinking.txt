To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Architecture Search for Deep Image Prior" by Kary Ho et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the Deep Image Prior (DIP) and its applications in image restoration tasks. However, I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention three public datasets:

1. **Places2**: This dataset is commonly used for in-painting tasks. The authors reference it as a dataset of photos, specifically noting that they sampled the test partition.

2. **Behance Artistic Media (BAM!)**: This dataset consists of artwork and is used for evaluating in-painting across various media styles. The authors specify that they selected a test partition of BAM! for their experiments.

3. **DIP**: This dataset is used to evaluate the original Deep Image Prior algorithm. The authors mention that they replicated the specific network architecture published in the original DIP paper for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Places2**, the citation is:
  > Bolei Zhou, Aditya Khosla, Agata Lapedriza, Antonio Torralba, and Aude Oliva. *Places: An image database for deep scene understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.02055, 2016.

- For **BAM!**, the citation is:
  > Michael J. Wilber, Chen Fang, Hailin Jin, Aaron Hertzmann, John Collomosse, and Serge Belongie. *BAM! The Behance Artistic Media Dataset for Recognition Beyond Photography*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.08614, 2017.

- For **DIP**, the citation is:
  > Dmitry Ulyanov, Andrea Vedaldi, and Victor Lempitsky. *Deep Image Prior*. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2018.

With this information, I have successfully identified and cited the datasets used in the paper. I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
