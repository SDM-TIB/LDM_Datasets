To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Dynamically Controlled Recurrent Neural Network for Modeling Dynamical Systems" by Yiwei Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the development of a new neural network architecture, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to delve deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention testing the DCRNN on several tasks, including a numerical dataset created to test forecasting performance for data generated by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). They also mention using the **MNIST dataset** and a **copy memory task** for additional experiments.

I will extract the following datasets:

1. **Lorenz System Dataset**: This dataset is created for testing the forecasting performance of the DCRNN. It is generated from the Lorenz system, which is governed by a set of ODEs. The authors describe how they sampled 200 initial conditions from a 3-dimensional Gaussian distribution to create training and testing trajectories.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: This is a well-known dataset used for image classification tasks, specifically for handwritten digits. The authors mention using it in a row-by-row format, treating each image as a sequence of time steps.

3. **Copy Memory Task Dataset**: This dataset is designed to test the model's ability to remember sequences. It consists of a series of entries where the first part contains actual information that needs to be remembered, followed by a delimiter and repeated entries.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Lorenz System**, since it is a mathematical model rather than a dataset published in a paper, I will not provide a citation for it.
  
- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **Copy Memory Task**, this task is based on the work by Arjovsky et al. (2016), so I will cite that paper:
  > Martin Arjovsky, Amar Shah, and Yoshua Bengio. *Unitary Evolution Recurrent Neural Networks*. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 1120â€“1128, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
