To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Repair Software Vulnerabilities with Generative Adversarial Networks" by Jacob A. Harer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of an adversarial learning approach for repairing software vulnerabilities, which suggests that datasets related to software vulnerabilities might be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using two hand-curated datasets: one for sorting sequences of numbers and another for a simple Context Free Grammar (CFG). They also discuss a dataset called **SATE IV**, which contains C/C++ synthetic code examples with vulnerabilities.

I will extract the details of each dataset mentioned:

1. **Sorting Dataset**: The authors generated a dataset where the repair task is to sort sequences of 20 randomly selected integers. This dataset is created by injecting errors into the sequences, allowing for paired examples of good and bad sequences.

2. **Context Free Grammar (CFG) Dataset**: This dataset is generated from a simple CFG, where good data is selected randomly from sequences that satisfy the grammar. Errors are injected into these sequences, similar to the sorting dataset.

3. **SATE IV Dataset**: This dataset contains C/C++ synthetic code examples with vulnerabilities from 116 different Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) classes. It includes a total of 117,738 functions, with 41,171 containing vulnerabilities and 76,567 not containing vulnerabilities. The authors describe how they created paired and unpaired datasets from this source.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **SATE IV dataset**, the citation is:
  > V. Okun, A. Delaitre, and P. E. Black. *Report on the Static Analysis Tool Exposition (SATE) IV*. Technical report, 2013.

The sorting and CFG datasets are generated by the authors and do not have formal citations, but I will note that they are based on the authors' experimental design.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the SATE IV dataset and noting the generated nature of the other datasets. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
