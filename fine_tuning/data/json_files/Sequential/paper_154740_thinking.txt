To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Audio Captioning with Composition of Acoustic and Semantic Information" by Ayşegül Özkaya Eren and Mustafa Sert, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two audio captioning datasets, specifically **Clotho** and **AudioCaps**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** more closely. The authors reference previous works that utilized various datasets, including **ProSound Effects**, **AudioCaps**, and **Clotho**. This section provides context on how these datasets relate to the current study.

In the **results section**, the authors explicitly mention the two datasets used for their experiments: **AudioCaps** and **Clotho**. They provide details about the number of audio clips and the structure of the datasets, confirming their significance in the research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **AudioCaps**: The citation is:
   > C. D. Kim, B. Kim, H. Lee, and G. Kim. *AudioCaps: Generating captions for audios in the wild*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 119–132, 2019.

2. **Clotho**: The citation is:
   > K. Drossos, S. Lipping, and T. Virtanen. *Clotho: an audio captioning dataset*. In ICASSP 2020 - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, pages 1–5, May 2020.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **AudioCaps**: A large-scale dataset containing 46,000 audio clips, each with one caption in the development split and five captions in the validation and test splits.
- **Clotho**: Contains 2,893 audio clips for development and 1,043 for evaluation, with five captions for each audio clip.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset.
