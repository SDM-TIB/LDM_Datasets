To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-layer Attention Mechanism for Speech Keyword Recognition" by Ruisen Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **Google Speech Command datasets V2** for keyword spotting, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this case, the paper explicitly states that the training sample bank used is the **Google Speech Command datasets V2**, which contains 20 keywords. The authors provide details about the dataset split, indicating the number of training, validation, and test samples.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Google Speech Command datasets V2**. This dataset is commonly referenced in the literature, so I will ensure to provide the correct citation format.

The citation for the **Google Speech Command datasets V2** is:
> Jonathan Hui. *Soft & hard attention*. Available at: https://jhui.github.io/2017/03/15/Soft-and-hard-attention. Accessed on: 2017-05-12.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **Google Speech Command datasets V2** and ensure that it is ready for review or further processing.
