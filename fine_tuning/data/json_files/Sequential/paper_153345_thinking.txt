To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weakly Supervised Energy-Based Learning for Action Segmentation" by Jun Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss their contributions and the context of their work. Here, they mention the use of the **Breakfast Action**, **Hollywood Extended**, and **50Salads** datasets for evaluation. This is a strong indication that these datasets are central to their experiments.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that describe these datasets in detail. In the results section, the authors provide descriptions of the datasets:

1. **Breakfast Action Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,712 videos of people making breakfast, featuring 10 cooking activities and 48 action classes. Each video has an average of 6.9 action instances, with lengths varying from a few seconds to several minutes.

2. **Hollywood Extended Dataset**: This dataset contains 937 video clips from various Hollywood movies, showcasing 16 action classes. Each clip has an average of 2.5 actions.

3. **50Salads Dataset**: This dataset includes 50 long videos demonstrating 17 classes of human manipulative gestures, with an average of 20 action instances per video and a total of 600,000 annotated frames.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Breakfast Action Dataset**:

- For the **Hollywood Extended Dataset**:

  > Sebastian Stein and Stephen J McKenna. *Combining embedded accelerometers with computer vision for recognizing food preparation activities*. In Proceedings of the 2013 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing, pages 729–738. ACM, 2013.

With this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
