To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rhythm is a Dancer: Music-Driven Motion Synthesis with Global Structure" by Andreas Aristidou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Results and Discussion)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. In this section, the authors mention that they invited 32 professional dancers to perform various dance genres, which indicates that a dataset was created from these performances.

I will note the details provided about the dataset:
- The dataset consists of paired and synchronized dance performances to music, lasting between 60 to 180 seconds.
- It includes approximately 2 hours of salsa dancing, 20 minutes of modern dance, and 20 minutes of folk dance, all recorded with corresponding music tracks.

Next, I will check the **appendix** for any additional details about the dataset, such as the specific features extracted or the methods used for data collection. The appendix may also provide insights into the audio features used in conjunction with the motion data.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors do not provide specific citations for existing datasets, as they created their own dataset for this research. However, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **Custom Dance Dataset**: This dataset includes motion capture data from 32 professional dancers performing various dance genres (salsa, modern, and folk) to different music tracks. The dataset is characterized by:
   - Duration: 60-180 seconds per performance.
   - Dance Genres: Salsa (approximately 2 hours), Modern (20 minutes), Folk (20 minutes).
   - Audio: Corresponding music tracks with varying intensities and tempos.

Since this dataset is original and created by the authors, it does not have a formal citation like established datasets. However, I will document it as follows:

- **Citation for Custom Dance Dataset**:

Finally, I will ensure that I have captured all relevant details about the dataset, including its purpose, characteristics, and the context in which it was used in the research. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset for future reference or analysis.
