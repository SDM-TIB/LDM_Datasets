To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Face Identification in a 2D Wireframe Projection of a Manifold Object" by Kehan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for algorithms to convert 2D line drawings into 3D models and hint at the use of a dataset for training their model. I will pay close attention to any specific dataset names or references.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention building a benchmark using a subset of CAD mechanical models from the **ABC dataset**. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized for their experiments.

I will also look for any details about how the dataset was constructed, including the number of samples used for training, validation, and testing, as well as any filtering criteria applied to the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **ABC dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- **ABC dataset**: 
  > Sebastian Koch, Albert Matveev, Zhongshi Jiang, Francis Williams, Alexey Artemov, Evgeny Burnaev, Marc Alexa, Denis Zorin, and Daniele Panozzo. *ABC: A big CAD model dataset for geometric deep learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 9601â€“9611, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified in the paper, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
