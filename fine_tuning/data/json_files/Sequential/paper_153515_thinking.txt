To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Flatsomatic: A Method for Compression of Somatic Mutation Profiles in Cancer" by Geoffroy Dubourg-Felonneau et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used somatic profiles from **8,062 Pan-Cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)** and **989 cell lines from the COSMIC cell line project (CCLP)**. This suggests that these are the primary datasets used in their study.

Next, I will confirm the details of these datasets in the **methods section**. Here, the authors elaborate on the somatic profiles used for training their models, reiterating that they consist of the same **8,062 Pan-Cancer patients from TCGA** and **989 cell lines from CCLP**. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**, the citation is:
   > Network The Cancer Genome Atlas Research, et al. *The cancer genome atlas pan-cancer analysis project*. Nature Genetics, 45:1113, 2013. doi: 10.1038/ng.2764. URL https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.2764.

2. For **COSMIC cell line project (CCLP)**, the citation is:
   > Nidhi Bindal, Simon A. Forbes, David Beare, et al. *COSMIC: the catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer*. 2011.

With these citations in hand, I will prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
