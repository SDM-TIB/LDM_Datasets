To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Left-to-Right Dependency Parsing with Pointer Networks" by Daniel Fernández-González and Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and its performance, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide context about the datasets used in the experiments, so I will pay close attention to any references to datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Stanford Dependencies** conversion of the **English Penn Treebank** (PTB-SD) for their experiments. This is a clear indication that the PTB-SD dataset is one of the primary datasets utilized in their research.

I will also check for any additional datasets mentioned in the context of comparing their approach to other models. The authors reference the **Universal Dependency Treebanks (UD)**, which suggests that they conducted experiments across multiple languages using this dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: The citation for the Penn Treebank is:
   > Mitchell P. Marcus, Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19:313–330, 1993.

2. **Universal Dependencies (UD)**: The citation for the Universal Dependencies is:
   > Nivre, Joakim, et al. *Universal Dependencies 2.0*. In Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Parsing Technologies (IWPT), pages 1-10, 2017.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details, including the context in which each dataset was used in the experiments. This will help in providing a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
