To extract datasets from the research paper titled "G2: Enhance Knowledge Grounded Dialogue via Ground Graph" by Yizhe Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. In the abstract, the authors discuss empirical results on their model's performance, indicating that they evaluated it on two public datasets. This is a strong indication that specific datasets will be mentioned later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly section 3, where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. Here, they explicitly mention the two datasets used for evaluation: **Wizard of Wikipedia** and **CMU DoG**. I will take note of the context in which these datasets are used, including their characteristics and the specific aspects of dialogue they address.

In the **dataset description**, the authors provide details about each dataset:
1. **Wizard of Wikipedia**: This dataset consists of conversations grounded in passages extracted from Wikipedia, covering a diverse range of topics. It is split into seen and unseen subsets for evaluation purposes.
2. **CMU DoG**: This dataset contains conversations grounded in Wikipedia descriptions or movie reviews, focusing primarily on the movie domain.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:
- For **Wizard of Wikipedia**, the citation is:
  > Dinan, E., Roller, S., Shuster, K., Fan, A., Auli, M., & Weston, J. (2018). Wizard of Wikipedia: Knowledge-powered conversational agents. In Proc. of ICLR.

- For **CMU DoG**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, K., Prabhumoye, S., & Black, A. W. (2018). A dataset for document grounded conversations. In Proc. of EMNLP.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
