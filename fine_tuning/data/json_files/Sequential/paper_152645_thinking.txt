To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EA-LSTM: Evolutionary Attention-based LSTM for Time Series Prediction" by Youru Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of datasets for time series prediction, which indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets Description and Setup)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details that can help in understanding their context and usage.

The paper mentions three datasets:

1. **Beijing PM2.5 Dataset**: This dataset contains PM2.5 data from the US Embassy in Beijing, collected hourly from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2014. It includes meteorological data and is used for predicting PM2.5 concentration.

2. **SML2010 Dataset**: An open dataset from UCI, used for indoor temperature prediction. It consists of approximately 40 days of monitoring data collected every minute, with various sensor data included.

3. **MSR Action3D Dataset**: This dataset contains sequences of actions performed by subjects, recorded with a depth sensor. It includes 20 different actions and is used for human action recognition.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Beijing PM2.5 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liang, X., Zou, T., Guo, B., Li, S., Zhang, H., Zhang, S., Huang, H., & Chen, S. X. (2015). Assessing Beijing’s PM2.5 pollution: severity, weather impact, APEC and winter heating. *Proceedings of the Royal Society A*, 471(2186), 20150257.

- For the **SML2010 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zamora-Martínez, F., Romeu, P., Botella-Rocamora, P., & Pardo, J. (2014). Online learning of indoor temperature forecasting models towards energy efficiency. *Energy and Buildings*, 83, 162-172.

- For the **MSR Action3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Du, Y., Wang, W., & Wang, L. (2015). Hierarchical recurrent neural network for skeleton based action recognition. In *CVPR 2015* (pp. 1110-1118).

Now that I have gathered the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
