To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Architecture Search for Compressed Sensing Magnetic Resonance Image Reconstruction" by Jiangpeng Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental analysis sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental analysis section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Dataset and Pre-processing)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **mini-fastMRI knee dataset**: This dataset includes raw complex-valued fully-sampled single-coil k-space data with 80 scans and 2829 slices for training, and 40 scans with 1457 slices for testing. The authors detail the preprocessing steps taken to prepare the data for their experiments.

2. **mini-fastMRI brain dataset**: This dataset consists of 100 scans with 1600 slices for training and 50 scans with 800 slices for testing. The authors explain how they treated the real-valued brain MR images as complex-valued for their analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the fastMRI dataset, which is crucial for providing the correct citation.

The citation for the fastMRI dataset is:
> Zbontar, J., Knoll, F., Sriram, A., Muckley, M.J., Bruno, M., Defazio, A., Parente, M., Geras, K., Katsnelson, J., Chandarana, H., Zhang, Z., Drozdzal, M., Romero, A., Rabbat, M.G., Vincent, P., Pinkerton, J., Wang, D., Yakubova, N., Owens, E., Zitnick, C.L., Recht, M.P., Sodickson, D.K., Lui, Y.W. (2018). *fastMRI: An open dataset and benchmarks for accelerated MRI*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.08839.

Now that I have the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
