To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Solution of Deep Learning for Enhanced Support Vector Machine for Predicting the Onset of Type 2 Diabetes" by Marmik Shrestha et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention the datasets used for the experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the context of their research. They mention the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques for predicting Type 2 Diabetes, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

In the **results and discussion sections**, the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. They mention two datasets:

1. **Pima Indians Dataset 1**: This dataset contains 769 samples with 9 feature sets, which are used for training and testing the model.
2. **Pima Indians Dataset 2**: This dataset contains 768 samples, also with 9 feature sets, and is similarly used for model evaluation.

Additionally, they refer to the **Global Diabetes Health Record from WHO**, which consists of 2132 samples and 32 feature sets. This dataset is also utilized in their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **Pima Indians Dataset**:
  > Smith, J. (1988). *Pima Indians Diabetes Database*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available at: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes).

- For **Global Diabetes Health Record, WHO**:
  > World Health Organization. (2020). *Global Health Observatory Data Repository*. Available at: [https://www.who.int/data/gho](https://www.who.int/data/gho).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or sharing with others interested in the research.
