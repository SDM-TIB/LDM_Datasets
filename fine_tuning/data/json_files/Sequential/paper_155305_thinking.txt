To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Bayesian Deep Learning Approach to Near-Term Climate Prediction" by Xihaier Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets or sources of data used for climate prediction.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data and Problem Setup)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors discuss the spatiotemporal variability of sea surface temperature (SST) in the North Atlantic, specifically referencing the **Community Earth System Model (CESM2)** and its pre-industrial control simulation (piControl). This indicates that the dataset is derived from a well-known climate model.

The authors mention that the data is publicly available from the **CMIP archive** at https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/cmip6. This is a crucial piece of information as it points to the source of the dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following key references related to the dataset:

1. **Community Earth System Model (CESM2)**:
   > Danabasoglu, G., Lamarque, J.-F., Bacmeister, J., Bailey, D., DuVivier, A., Edwards, J., ... others (2020). The community earth system model version 2 (cesm2). *Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems*, 12(2), e2019MS001916.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Dataset Name**: Community Earth System Model (CESM2) - piControl simulation
   - **Description**: This dataset contains spatiotemporal variability of sea surface temperature (SST) in the North Atlantic over the last 800 years of the pre-industrial control simulation.
   - **Source**: Publicly available from the CMIP archive at https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/cmip6.
   - **Citation**: Danabasoglu, G., Lamarque, J.-F., Bacmeister, J., Bailey, D., DuVivier, A., Edwards, J., ... others (2020). The community earth system model version 2 (cesm2). *Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems*, 12(2), e2019MS001916.

2. **Dataset Name**: Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6)
   - **Description**: A framework for coordinated climate model experiments, providing a comprehensive dataset for climate research.
   - **Citation**: IPCC. (2021). Climate change 2021: The physical science basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Cambridge University Press.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
