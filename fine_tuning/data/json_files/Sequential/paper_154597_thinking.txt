To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PredRNN: A Recurrent Neural Network for Spatiotemporal Predictive Learning" by Yunbo Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieve state-of-the-art performance on five datasets for predictive learning, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **Moving MNIST Dataset**: This dataset contains handwritten digits that are sampled from the static MNIST dataset, placed at random locations, and initialized with random speeds. The authors specify that they use a fixed training set of 10,000 samples and a test set of 5,000 sequences.

2. **KTH Action Dataset**: This dataset includes six types of human actions performed by 25 persons in various scenes. The authors provide details about the training and testing splits, indicating a training set of 108,717 sequences and a test set of 4,086 sequences.

3. **Radar Echo Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,000 consecutive radar maps recorded every 6 minutes. The authors mention that they transform these maps into pixel values and divide the dataset into training and test sequences.

4. **Traffic4Cast Dataset**: This dataset records GPS trajectories of traffic flows in major cities. The authors describe the dataset's structure and how it is used for their experiments.

5. **BAIR Dataset**: This dataset contains action-conditioned videos collected by a robotic arm. The authors provide details about the training and test sets.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
