To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Incorporating Structural Information to Improve Dialogue Response Generation" by Nikita Moghe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a new architecture for generating dialogue responses based on background knowledge, which suggests that datasets related to dialogue or conversational data may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the need for background knowledge in dialogue systems. They reference a dataset that contains conversations about movies, specifically mentioning that every alternate utterance is extracted from a background document. This indicates that there is at least one dataset that I need to identify.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors explicitly mention using the **Holl-E dataset** for their experiments. They describe this dataset as containing approximately 9,000 movie chats and 90,000 utterances, with each chat associated with background knowledge resources such as movie plots and reviews. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the Holl-E dataset. The authors cite the original paper that introduced this dataset:

- For the **Holl-E dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nikita Moghe, Siddhartha Arora, Suman Banerjee, and Mitesh M. Khapra. *Towards exploiting background knowledge for building conversation systems*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2322â€“2332, Brussels, Belgium, October-November 2018. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is essential for proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that it is clear and accurately reflects the information extracted from the paper.
