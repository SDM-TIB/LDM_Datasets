To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey of Generative Techniques for Spatial-Temporal Data Mining" by Qianru Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodologies and applications** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that are likely to contain specific dataset references.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **related works section** and the **applications section**. These sections often list datasets used in previous studies or those that the authors have worked with. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that summarize datasets, as they often provide concise information.

In the **applications section**, the authors mention various tasks such as spatial-temporal representation learning, forecasting, and recommendation. I will check if any datasets are associated with these tasks, particularly in **Table 2**, which summarizes related works and their datasets.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down their full citations from the **References section**. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for each dataset's use in the research.

For example, if I find a dataset like "CHITaxi" mentioned in the context of traffic prediction, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> "CHITaxi: A dataset for urban taxi demand prediction," in Proceedings of the 29th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2023.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all datasets mentioned in the paper, along with their citations, to facilitate further research or analysis.
