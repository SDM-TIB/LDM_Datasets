To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploration on Generating Traditional Chinese Medicine Prescriptions from Symptoms with an End-to-End Approach" by Wei Li, Xu Sun, and Zheng Yang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a large number of prescriptions and symptom descriptions, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset Construction)**, where the authors describe the dataset they constructed. Here, they mention that they crawled data from the TCM Prescription Knowledge Base, which includes 710 historic books or documents and a total of 85,166 prescriptions. They cleaned and formalized this data to obtain 82,044 usable symptom-prescription pairs.

In this section, I will note the details of the dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: TCM Prescription Knowledge Base
- **Description**: A dataset containing 82,044 symptom-prescription pairs derived from 710 historic TCM books and documents.
- **Source**: The dataset was constructed by crawling the TCM Prescription Knowledge Base.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the TCM Prescription Knowledge Base. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for this knowledge base, so I will note that it is referenced as a website (http://www.hhjfsl.com/fang/) in the text.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as best as possible, given the context provided in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset entry for clarity and completeness, ensuring that I have captured all relevant details for future reference or processing.
