To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Organ at Risk Segmentation for Head and Neck Cancer using Stratified Learning and Neural Architecture Search" by Dazhou Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new approach for organ at risk (OAR) segmentation and hints at the use of a dataset for evaluation, which suggests that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Preprocessing)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **H&N 42 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 142 anonymized non-contrast RTCT images from head and neck cancer patients, with 42 OARs delineated by an experienced oncologist. The average CT size is specified, along with the resolution.

2. **MICCAI 2015 Dataset**: This dataset is used as an external validation set and contains 33 training cases and 15 test cases with 9 OARs annotated. The specific OARs included in this dataset are also mentioned.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For the **H&N 42 Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is described in detail in the paper itself. I will note that it is a novel dataset introduced by the authors.

- For the **MICCAI 2015 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Raudaschl, P. F., Zaffino, P., Sharp, G. C., Spadea, M. F., Chen, A., Dawant, B. M., Albrecht, T., Gass, T., Langguth, C., & Luthi, M. (2017). Evaluation of segmentation methods on head and neck CT: auto-segmentation challenge 2015. *Medical Physics*, 44(5), 2020-2036.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their descriptions, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will allow for clear documentation and reference in future work or analysis.
