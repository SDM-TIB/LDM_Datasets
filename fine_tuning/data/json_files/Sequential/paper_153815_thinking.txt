To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Space Debris Ontology for ADR Capture Methods Selection" by Marko Jankovic et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors have built a database of 30 representative objects, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the need for coherent data in the context of active debris removal (ADR) and mention a database of intact derelict objects (IDOs) that they have created. This is a strong indication that a dataset is being utilized.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the data sources used for their ontology, including structured data from ESA's DISCOS database and unstructured data from various web resources. They mention that the structured data includes identification properties, physical dimensions, and orbital properties of potential ADR targets. This section provides valuable details about the datasets used.

In the **results section**, the authors present an example database consisting of 210 ontology individuals related to 30 large intact cataloged objects. They provide characteristics of these objects, which further confirms the existence of a dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **DISCOS Database**: The citation for the DISCOS database is:
   > ESA Space Debris Office. *DISCOS - Database and Information System Characterising Objects in Space*. Available at: https://discosweb.esoc.esa.int/ (accessed 7-July-2019).

2. **Example Database of 30 Objects**: While the paper does not provide a formal citation for the example database, it is derived from the DISCOS database and the authors' own research. Therefore, it can be referenced as:
   > Jankovic, M., YÃ¼ksek, M., Mohammadzadeh Babr, M., Letizia, F., & Braun, V. (2020). *Space Debris Ontology for ADR Capture Methods Selection*. In Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress (IAC), 2020.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its citation for future reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
