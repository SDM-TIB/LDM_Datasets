To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeuralDPS: Neural Deterministic Plus Stochastic Model with Multiband Excitation for Noise-Controllable Waveform Generation" by Tao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors might have used to validate their proposed methods. This section often contains background information and may highlight key datasets relevant to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they typically specify the datasets used for training and testing their models. For example, in this paper, the authors mention using the **CMU-ARCTIC databases** and the **LJ Speech Dataset** for their experiments.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional details about the datasets, such as the number of samples or specific characteristics that are relevant to the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

For the datasets identified in this paper, I will compile the following citations:

1. **CMU-ARCTIC databases**:
   > Kominek, J., & Black, A. W. (2004). The CMU Arctic speech databases. In Fifth ISCA Workshop on Speech Synthesis.

2. **LJ Speech Dataset**:
   > Ito, K., & Johnson, L. (2017). The LJ Speech Dataset. Retrieved from https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
