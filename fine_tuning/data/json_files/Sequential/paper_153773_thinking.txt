To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hybrid Residual Dilated LSTM and Exponential Smoothing Model for Mid-Term Electric Load Forecasting" by Grzegorz Dudek, Paweł Pełka, and Slawek Smyl, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model was validated using monthly electricity demand time series for 35 European countries, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The introduction discusses the importance of electricity demand forecasting but does not provide specific dataset names. Therefore, I will proceed to the **experimental study section** where the authors describe the data used for their experiments.

In the **experimental study section**, the authors explicitly state that the data were obtained from the **ENTSO-E repository** and that it includes monthly electricity demand time series for 35 European countries. This is a crucial piece of information as it identifies the source of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ENTSO-E dataset. However, since the dataset is sourced from a repository rather than a traditional publication, I will note that the citation should include the repository name and the URL.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> ENTSO-E. "European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity." Available at: www.entsoe.eu.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Monthly Electricity Demand Time Series
   - **Description**: This dataset contains monthly electricity demand data for 35 European countries, covering various lengths of time series data.
   - **Source**: ENTSO-E repository
   - **Citation**: ENTSO-E. "European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity." Available at: www.entsoe.eu.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
