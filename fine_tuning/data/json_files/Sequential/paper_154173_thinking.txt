To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "An analysis of deep neural networks for predicting trends in time series data" by Kouame Kouassi and Deshendran Moodley, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental design sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors replicated experiments on the same datasets used in a previous study, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental design)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four datasets:

1. **Voltage Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains 2,075,259 data points of household voltage measurements taken at one-minute intervals. It is characterized as highly volatile and normally distributed.

2. **Methane Dataset**: Also from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, this dataset consists of a resampled set of 41,786 data points at a frequency of 1Hz. It is described as skewed to the right and exhibits sharp changes with medium to low volatility.

3. **NYSE Dataset**: This dataset is obtained from Yahoo Finance and includes 13,563 data points of the composite New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) closing prices from December 31, 1965, to November 15, 2019. It is noted for its low volatility initially, which increases significantly after the year 2000.

4. **JSE Dataset**: This dataset, also from Yahoo Finance, contains 3,094 data points of the composite Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) closing prices from September 18, 2007, to December 31, 2019. It is characterized as less volatile compared to the NYSE dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Voltage Dataset**:
  > "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set." UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption.

- For the **Methane Dataset**:
  > "Gas Sensor Array Under Dynamic Gas Mixtures Data Set." UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/gas+sensor+array+under+dynamic+gas+mixtures.

  > Yahoo Finance. "Historical Data for NYSE." Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com.

- For the **JSE Dataset**:
  > Yahoo Finance. "Historical Data for JSE." Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
