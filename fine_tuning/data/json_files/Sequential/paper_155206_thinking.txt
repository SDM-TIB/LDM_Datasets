To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Smart Metering System Capable of Anomaly Detection by Bi-directional LSTM Autoencoder" by Sangkeum Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their anomaly detection method using metering data from smart meters, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the importance of smart metering data for anomaly detection. They mention that the dataset consists of data collected from 985 households, specifically for four types of energy sources: electricity, water, heating, and hot water. This gives me a clear indication of the dataset's scope.

In the **results section**, the authors provide further details about the dataset, confirming that it includes measurements from the four energy sources collected from the same 985 households. This reinforces the dataset's relevance to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it appears to be original data collected by the authors. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is proprietary to this research.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Smart Metering Dataset**: This dataset includes metering data from 985 households, covering four types of energy sources: electricity, water, heating, and hot water. The data is used for training and validating the BiLSTM autoencoder for anomaly detection.

Since there is no external citation for the dataset, I will document it as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Smart Metering Dataset
- **Description**: Metering data collected from 985 households for four types of energy sources: electricity, water, heating, and hot water.
- **Citation**: Sangkeum Lee, Hojun Jin, Sarvar Hussain Nengroo, Yoonmee Doh, Chungho Lee, Taewook Heo, Dongsoo Har. *Smart Metering System Capable of Anomaly Detection by Bi-directional LSTM Autoencoder*. Environment ICT Research Section, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, South Korea.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
