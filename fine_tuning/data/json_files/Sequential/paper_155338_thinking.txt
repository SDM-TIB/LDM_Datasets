To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Evaluation of Answer-Agnostic Paragraph-level Multi-Question Generation" by Jishnu Ray Chowdhury et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for experiments. 

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they utilize the **SQuAD1.1 dataset** for their experiments. This is a significant dataset in the field of question generation and is likely to be detailed further in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors specify that they perform experiments on the **processed SQuAD1.1 dataset** as provided by Du et al. (2017). This indicates that the dataset is not only mentioned but also utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SQuAD1.1 dataset. The citation for the SQuAD1.1 dataset is as follows:
> Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383–2392, Austin, Texas. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since the authors also reference Du et al. (2017) in relation to the SQuAD1.1 dataset, I will also retrieve the citation for that paper:
> Xinya Du, Junru Shao, and Claire Cardie. *Learning to ask: Neural question generation for reading comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1342–1352, Vancouver, Canada. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
