To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-Autoregressive Semantic Parsing for Compositional Task-Oriented Dialog" by Arun Babu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, I will look for a dedicated subsection that lists the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

In **section 3.1 (Datasets)**, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **TOP Dataset**: This dataset is for compositional utterances in navigation and events domains, consisting of 31,279 training instances and 9,042 test instances. The authors provide specific statistics about the target lengths, which is useful for understanding the dataset's structure.

2. **SNIPS Dataset**: This is a public dataset used for benchmarking semantic parsing intent slot models, with 13,084 training instances and 700 test instances. The authors also provide median target lengths for this dataset.

3. **DSTC2 Dataset**: This dataset is for conversational understanding, with 12,611 training instances and 9,890 test instances. Again, the authors include statistics about the target lengths.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The citations I find are:

- For the **TOP Dataset**:
  > Gupta, S., Shah, R., Mohit, M., Kumar, A., & Lewis, M. (2018). Semantic parsing for task oriented dialog using hierarchical representations. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 2787-2792). Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **SNIPS Dataset**:
  > Coucke, A., Saade, A., Ball, A., Bluche, T., Caulier, A., Leroy, D., Doumouro, C., Gisselbrecht, T., Caltagirone, F., & Lavril, T. (2018). Snips voice platform: an embedded spoken language understanding system for private-by-design voice interfaces. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.10190.

- For the **DSTC2 Dataset**:
  > Henderson, M., Thomson, B., & Williams, J. D. (2014). The second dialog state tracking challenge. In Proceedings of the 15th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue (SIGDIAL) (pp. 263-272). Association for Computational Linguistics.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations clearly. I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the name, description, and full citation as required.
