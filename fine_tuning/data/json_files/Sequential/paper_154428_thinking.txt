To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mapping the Timescale Organization of Neural Language Models" by Hsiang-Yun Sherry Chien, Jinhan Zhang, and Christopher J. Honey, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a method for mapping processing timescales in neural language models, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research but do not specify any datasets. I will proceed to the **methods section**, where they describe the language models and the corpus used for their analysis. Here, they mention using a **pre-trained word-level LSTM language model (WLSTM)** and a **pre-trained character-level LSTM model (CLSTM)**, but I need to find the specific datasets they were trained on.

In **section 3.1 (Language Models and Corpus)**, the authors specify that they evaluated the models using sentences sampled from the **Anna Karenina** novel, which is a significant dataset for their analysis. They also mention that the models were trained on **Wikipedia sentences**. This gives me two datasets to note.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Anna Karenina** dataset, the citation is:
   > Tolstoy, Leo. *Anna Karenina*. Lulu.com, 2016.

2. For the **Wikipedia dataset**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation for the Wikipedia dataset, it is commonly referenced in NLP literature. A general citation for the Wikipedia dataset can be:
   > Wikipedia contributors. "Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia." Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, [date of access]. URL: https://www.wikipedia.org/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes ensuring that I have accurately captured the names and citations of the datasets used in the research.
