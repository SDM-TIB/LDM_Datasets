To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ATP: A Holistic Attention Integrated Approach to Enhance ABSA" by Ashish Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors performed experiments on the **SemEval’14 dataset**, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look into **section 6 (Experimental Settings and Results)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention that they utilized the **restaurant and laptop review datasets** from SemEval’14. I will note the specifics provided about these datasets, including the number of review sentences in each dataset.

The paper specifies:
1. **Restaurant Dataset**: Contains 3,041 review sentences.
2. **Laptop Dataset**: Contains 3,845 review sentences.

Both datasets are used for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) tasks, and the authors also mention that they filtered reviews that do not contain any aspect-terms.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SemEval’14 datasets. The relevant citation is:
> Maria Pontiki, Dimitris Galanis, John Pavlopoulos, Harris Papageorgiou, Ion Androutsopoulos, and Suresh Manandhar. *SemEval-2014 task 4: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2014), pages 27–35, Dublin, Ireland, August 2014. Association for Computational Linguistics.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Restaurant Dataset**: 3,041 review sentences.
2. **Laptop Dataset**: 3,845 review sentences.

Both datasets are sourced from the SemEval’14 task on aspect-based sentiment analysis, and I will ensure to include the full citation for the SemEval’14 datasets in my final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
