To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Label Smoothing for Sequence to Sequence Problems" by Michal Lukasik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses improvements over state-of-the-art techniques on multiple datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention that they conducted experiments on three popular machine translation tasks: **English-German (EN-DE)**, **English-Czech (EN-CS)**, and **English-French (EN-FR)**, using the **WMT training datasets**. This indicates that the WMT datasets are the primary datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The WMT datasets are commonly referenced in the context of machine translation, and I will ensure to find the appropriate citation for them.

The citation for the WMT datasets is:
> Philipp Koehn, Christof Monz, and others. *Proceedings of the Conference on Machine Translation (WMT)*. Various years.

Since the paper does not specify individual citations for the WMT datasets for each language pair, I will use the general citation for the WMT conference.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as required.

1. **WMT English-German Dataset**: Used for the EN-DE translation task.
   - Citation: Philipp Koehn, Christof Monz, and others. *Proceedings of the Conference on Machine Translation (WMT)*. Various years.

2. **WMT English-Czech Dataset**: Used for the EN-CS translation task.
   - Citation: Philipp Koehn, Christof Monz, and others. *Proceedings of the Conference on Machine Translation (WMT)*. Various years.

3. **WMT English-French Dataset**: Used for the EN-FR translation task.
   - Citation: Philipp Koehn, Christof Monz, and others. *Proceedings of the Conference on Machine Translation (WMT)*. Various years.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its citation.
