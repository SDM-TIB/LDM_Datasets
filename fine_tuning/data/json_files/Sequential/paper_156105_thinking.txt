To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Supplementary Features of BiLSTM for Enhanced Sequence Labeling" by Conglei Xu, Kun Shen, and Hongguang Sun, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **nine datasets for sequence labeling tasks**, which suggests that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors detail their evaluations. They mention using datasets for three specific tasks: **End-to-End Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (E2E-ABSA)**, **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**, and **Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging**. This section is likely to contain the names of the datasets used for each task.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **E2E-ABSA Datasets**:
   - **Laptop14**: A dataset used for aspect-based sentiment analysis.
   - **Rest14**: Another dataset for aspect-based sentiment analysis.
   - **Rest15**: A dataset for aspect-based sentiment analysis.
   - **Rest16**: A dataset for aspect-based sentiment analysis.

2. **NER Datasets**:
   - **Conll2003**: A well-known dataset for named entity recognition tasks.
   - **Wnut2017**: A dataset for novel and emerging entity recognition.
   - **Weibo**: A dataset for named entity recognition in Chinese social media.

3. **POS Tagging Datasets**:
   - **Universal Dependencies (UD)**: A dataset for part-of-speech tagging.
   - **Conll2003**: Also mentioned for POS tagging tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for each dataset.

- For **Laptop14**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
