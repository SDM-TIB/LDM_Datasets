Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions that the employed datasets and the model are available in a Github repository, but it doesn't specify the names of the datasets. 

Moving on to the methodology section, I see that the authors conducted experiments using five publicly available and broadly used tabular anomaly detection datasets. These datasets are listed in Table 1 of the paper. The datasets mentioned are:

1. Letter [40]
2. Cardio [41]
3. Satellite [42]
4. Optical [43]
5. Pen [44]

Each of these datasets has specific characteristics, including size, dimensionality, and the percentage of outliers. 

Next, I'll check the references section to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the references are not provided in the text, so I'll have to rely on the information given in the paper.

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata fields based on the information provided in the paper. The creators, descriptions, titles, and other details are inferred from the context provided in the paper.

Finally, I'll compile this information into a structured JSON format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described according to the metadata vocabulary.
