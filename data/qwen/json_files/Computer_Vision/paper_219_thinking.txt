Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, I'll look through the abstract and introduction. The abstract mentions the MSCOCO dataset, which is a benchmark for image captioning. The introduction also refers to MSCOCO and Visual Genome.

Next, I'll check the sections where datasets are discussed in detail. In the "Datasets" section, the paper explicitly mentions MSCOCO and Visual Genome. MSCOCO is described as a benchmark for image captioning, and Visual Genome is used for pre-training object detectors.

I'll also look at the references to find more details about these datasets. MSCOCO is cited with a URL, and Visual Genome is mentioned as a large-scale dataset for object detection and relationships.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the metadata fields. For MSCOCO, the creators are the authors listed in the reference, the description is based on the paper's usage, and the landing page is the provided URL. Visual Genome's details are similarly extracted.

I need to ensure that each field is filled accurately. For example, the creators for MSCOCO are the authors from the reference, and the description reflects how the dataset is used in the paper.

Finally, I'll compile all the datasets into the required JSON format, making sure each field is correctly populated based on the information extracted from the paper.
