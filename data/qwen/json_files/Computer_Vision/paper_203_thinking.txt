Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Towards Semi-Supervised End-to-End Scene Text Recognition" by Christian Bartz, Haojin Yang, and Christoph Meinel. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors performed experiments on standard benchmark datasets. So, I need to look for specific dataset names in the paper.

Looking through the introduction, I don't see any datasets mentioned yet. The related work section might have some clues. In the related work, the authors discuss various approaches to scene text detection and recognition. They mention several datasets, such as SVHN, FSNS, and others.

In the experiments section, the authors detail their experiments on the SVHN dataset and a dataset they generated based on SVHN. They also mention the French Street Name Signs (FSNS) dataset. 

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. SVHN (Street View House Numbers) dataset
2. FSNS (French Street Name Signs) dataset
3. A generated dataset based on SVHN

Now, I need to extract metadata for each of these datasets using the specified vocabulary.

For SVHN:
- **dcterms:creator**: The authors of the SVHN dataset are Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu, and A. Y. Ng.
- **dcterms:description**: SVHN is a dataset of house numbers extracted from Google Street View images. It's commonly used for scene text recognition tasks.
- **dcterms:title**: SVHN Dataset
- **dcterms:issued**: The dataset was introduced in 2011.
- **dcterms:language**: English
- **dcterms:identifier**: The paper doesn't provide a DOI or URL, so it's empty.
- **dcat:theme**: Computer Vision, Scene Text Recognition
- **dcat:keyword**: Scene text, House numbers, Street view
- **dcat:landingPage**: Empty
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Empty
- **dcterms:format**: Image
- **mls:task**: Scene text recognition, Object detection

For FSNS:
- **dcterms:creator**: The authors are R. Smith, C. Gu, D.-S. Lee, H. Hu, R. Unnikrishnan, J. Ibarz, and S. Lin.
- **dcterms:description**: FSNS is a dataset of French street name signs extracted from Google Street View. It's used for scene text recognition and detection.
- **dcterms:title**: French Street Name Signs (FSNS) Dataset
- **dcterms:issued**: The dataset was introduced in 2016.
- **dcterms:language**: French
- **dcterms:identifier**: Empty
- **dcat:theme**: Computer Vision, Scene Text Recognition
- **dcat:keyword**: Street signs, French text, Scene text
- **dcat:landingPage**: Empty
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Empty
- **dcterms:format**: Image
- **mls:task**: Scene text recognition, Text detection

For the generated SVHN-based dataset:
- **dcterms:creator**: The authors of the paper, Christian Bartz, Haojin Yang, and Christoph Meinel.
- **dcterms:description**: A dataset generated by the authors based on SVHN, containing images with multiple house numbers arranged in a regular grid or randomly positioned.
- **dcterms:title**: Generated SVHN Dataset
- **dcterms:issued**: The paper doesn't specify the year, so it's empty.
- **dcterms:language**: English
- **dcterms:identifier**: Empty
- **dcat:theme**: Computer Vision, Scene Text Recognition
- **dcat:keyword**: Generated data, Scene text, House numbers
- **dcat:landingPage**: Empty
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Empty
- **dcterms:format**: Image
- **mls:task**: Scene text recognition, Text detection

I need to ensure that each dataset's metadata is accurately filled based on the information from the paper. If any details are missing, I'll leave those fields empty.
