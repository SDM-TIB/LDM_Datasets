Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper is titled "AutoAssist: A Framework to Accelerate Training of Deep Neural Networks" and discusses a method to speed up training by using an Assistant network alongside the main Boss network.

Looking through the sections, I find that datasets are mentioned in the experimental results. Specifically, the paper tests AutoAssist on image classification and neural machine translation tasks.

For image classification, the datasets used are:
1. MNIST
2. FashionMNIST
3. Extended MNIST
4. CIFAR10

For machine translation, the datasets are:
1. Multi30K
2. WMT 2014 English-German

Now, I'll gather metadata for each dataset. Since the paper doesn't provide detailed descriptions or URLs for each dataset, I'll rely on general knowledge and the context provided in the paper.

MNIST is a well-known dataset of handwritten digits. FashionMNIST is similar but contains fashion items. Extended MNIST likely includes more characters. CIFAR10 is a dataset of small images across 10 classes. Multi30K involves image descriptions in multiple languages, and WMT 2014 is a large machine translation dataset.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, noting that some fields like creators, identifiers, and landing pages might be empty or inferred based on common knowledge.
