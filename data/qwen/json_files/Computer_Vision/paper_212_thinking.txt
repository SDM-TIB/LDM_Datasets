Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is titled "LARGE BATCH OPTIMIZATION FOR DEEP LEARNING: TRAINING BERT IN 76 MINUTES" by Yang You and others. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to understand the context. The paper discusses optimizing large batch sizes for training deep neural networks, specifically focusing on BERT and ResNet-50. 

In the introduction, they mention BERT and ResNet-50 as examples of models they're training. BERT is a language model, and ResNet-50 is an image classification model. These are standard datasets/models, so I need to identify if they're referring to specific datasets or just the models.

Looking further, in the experiments section, they mention using the SQuAD task for BERT training. SQuAD is a well-known dataset for question answering. They also reference ImageNet for ResNet-50 training. ImageNet is a large dataset of images used for image classification tasks.

I should check if there are any other datasets mentioned. The paper also mentions CIFAR-10 and MNIST in the appendices, but these are smaller datasets used for testing and validation purposes.

So, the main datasets used are:
1. BERT's training dataset (Wikipedia and BooksCorpus)
2. SQuAD dataset
3. ImageNet dataset
4. CIFAR-10 and MNIST (mentioned in appendices)

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata. For each dataset, I'll extract the creator, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For BERT's training data, the creators are the authors of the original BERT paper. The description includes the datasets used (Wikipedia and BooksCorpus). The title is "BERT Training Dataset". The year is 2018. The language is English. The identifier is the GitHub repository link. The theme is NLP. Keywords include BERT, pre-training, etc. The landing page is the GitHub link. The format is text. The task is language modeling.

For SQuAD, the creators are the authors of the SQuAD paper. The description is about question answering. The title is "SQuAD Dataset". The year is 2016. Language is English. Identifier is the GitHub link. Theme is NLP. Keywords include question answering. Landing page is GitHub. Format is text. Task is QA.

For ImageNet, the creators are the ImageNet team. Description is about image classification. Title is "ImageNet". Year is 2009. Language is English. Identifier is the ImageNet website. Theme is Computer Vision. Keywords include image classification. Landing page is the ImageNet website. Format is images. Task is image classification.

CIFAR-10 and MNIST are mentioned in the appendices. CIFAR-10's creators are Krizhevsky et al. Description is about image classification. Title is "CIFAR-10". Year is 2009. Language is English. Identifier is the website. Theme is Computer Vision. Keywords include image classification. Landing page is the website. Format is images. Task is image classification.

MNIST's creators are LeCun et al. Description is about handwritten digits. Title is "MNIST". Year is 1998. Language is English. Identifier is the website. Theme is Computer Vision. Keywords include handwritten digits. Landing page is the website. Format is images. Task is image classification.

I need to ensure that each dataset is correctly attributed and described based on the paper's usage. I'll structure each as a JSON object with the required fields.
