Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "GPipe: Easy Scaling with Micro-Batch Pipeline Parallelism" and is authored by several researchers from Google. The abstract mentions training large models on two tasks: Image Classification and Multilingual Neural Machine Translation.

Looking into the details, the paper describes training an AmoebaNet model on the ImageNet-2012 dataset. ImageNet is a well-known dataset for image classification, containing millions of images across various classes. The paper also mentions a multilingual machine translation task using a corpus spanning over 100 languages.

I'll check the references section to find more details about these datasets. The ImageNet-2012 dataset is cited as Deng et al., 2009. The multilingual translation corpus isn't explicitly cited, but it's described as containing 25 billion training examples across 102 languages.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information extracted from the paper.
