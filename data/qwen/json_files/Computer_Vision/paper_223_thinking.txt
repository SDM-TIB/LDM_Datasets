Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about an automatic perturbation analysis framework for neural networks, focusing on scalable certified robustness and beyond. It's quite technical, so I need to carefully go through each section to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll start with the abstract. It mentions using LiRPA (Linear Relaxation based Perturbation Analysis) for neural networks and mentions that the framework is applied to various architectures like DenseNet, ResNeXt, and Transformer. However, these are model architectures, not datasets.

Moving on to the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of robustness verification and certified defense in neural networks. They reference previous works but don't mention specific datasets here.

In the background section, they talk about existing methods like Wong et al. [48] and CROWN [53], but again, these are methods, not datasets. They do mention that their framework is applied to general computational graphs, which might involve various datasets, but none are explicitly named.

Looking at the experiments section, Table 2 lists results on CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet. These are datasets. CIFAR-10 is a well-known dataset of 10 classes with 60,000 32x32 color images. Tiny ImageNet is a subset of ImageNet with 200 classes, each containing 500 images for training, 50 for validation, and 50 for testing.

Table 4 mentions Downscaled ImageNet, which is another version of ImageNet but downscaled to smaller resolutions, likely for testing scalability.

In the experiments, they also mention SST-2, which is a sentiment analysis dataset. SST-2 is part of the Stanford Sentiment Treebank, containing movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

Additionally, the paper discusses experiments on MNIST and Fashion MNIST. MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits, while Fashion MNIST is a similar dataset but with fashion items.

The authors also reference the use of word embeddings and synonym-based word substitution in language tasks, which might involve datasets like the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) and possibly others, but these aren't explicitly named beyond SST-2.

In the results and experiments, they mention using these datasets to evaluate their framework's performance in certified defense and robustness verification.

So, compiling all the datasets mentioned:

1. CIFAR-10
2. Tiny ImageNet
3. Downscaled ImageNet
4. MNIST
5. Fashion MNIST
6. SST-2

Each of these datasets is used to evaluate the framework's effectiveness in different domains and tasks, such as image classification and sentiment analysis.

Now, I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is described with the appropriate metadata based on the paper's usage.
