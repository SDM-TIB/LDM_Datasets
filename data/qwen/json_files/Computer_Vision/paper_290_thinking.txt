Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Transformer-Transducer: End-to-End Speech Recognition with Self-Attention" by Ching-Feng Yeh and others from Facebook AI. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on the public LibriSpeech corpus. 

Looking further into the paper, the introduction and methodology sections don't mention any other datasets. The experiments section details the use of LibriSpeech for training and evaluation. 

In the references, LibriSpeech is cited as [24], which points to the paper by Vassil Panayotov et al. from 2015. 

So, the only dataset mentioned is LibriSpeech. I'll gather the metadata for this dataset based on the information provided in the paper and the reference.

- **dcterms:creator**: The authors of the LibriSpeech dataset are Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur.
- **dcterms:description**: It's a corpus of read speech data, widely used for ASR tasks, with 960 hours of training data and multiple test sets.
- **dcterms:title**: LibriSpeech.
- **dcterms:issued**: 2015, as per the reference.
- **dcterms:language**: English, as it's based on public-domain audio books.
- **dcterms:identifier**: The DOI from the reference is 10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178964.
- **dcat:theme**: Speech Recognition, Corpus.
- **dcat:keyword**: Speech, ASR, Corpus, LibriSpeech.
- **dcat:landingPage**: The URL from the reference is https://www.openslr.org/12.
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Not mentioned, so empty string.
- **dcterms:format**: Audio, Text.
- **mls:task**: Speech Recognition, ASR.

I'll structure this information into the required JSON format.
