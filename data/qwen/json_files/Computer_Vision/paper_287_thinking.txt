Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper titled "AutoToon: Automatic Geometric Warping for Face Cartoon Generation." The paper discusses a method for generating face cartoons using deep learning, and it references several datasets used in their experiments and related work.

First, I'll go through the paper section by section to identify any datasets mentioned. 

In the abstract, the authors mention their own dataset, the AutoToon dataset, which includes paired images of human facial portraits and their corresponding geometrically warped cartoons by trained artists. This is one dataset.

Looking into the related work section, the authors reference the WebCaricature dataset, which is a dataset of 6042 caricatures and 5974 photographs from 252 different identities. This is another dataset.

Additionally, the authors mention the VGGFace2 dataset, which is used for facial recognition and was used to pretrain their model. This is the third dataset.

I'll now structure each of these datasets according to the specified metadata vocabulary.

For the AutoToon dataset:
- The creators are the authors of the paper: Julia Gong, Yannick Hold-Geoffroy, and Jingwan Lu.
- The description is a paired dataset of photos and artist-warped cartoons.
- The title is "AutoToon dataset."
- The issued year is 2020, as the paper was published in 2020.
- The language is English.
- The identifier is empty as no DOI or URL is provided.
- The theme is Computer Vision and Face Processing.
- The keywords include face warping, cartoon generation, paired dataset.
- The landing page is empty.
- The format is Image.
- The task is Face Cartoon Generation.

For the WebCaricature dataset:
- The creators are the authors of the dataset: J. Huo, W. Li, Y. Shi, Y. Gao, and H. Yin.
- The description is a dataset of 6042 caricatures and 5974 photographs.
- The title is "WebCaricature dataset."
- The issued year is 2018.
- The language is English.
- The identifier is empty.
- The theme is Computer Vision and Face Processing.
- The keywords include caricature recognition, paired dataset.
- The landing page is empty.
- The format is Image.
- The task is Caricature Recognition.

For the VGGFace2 dataset:
- The creators are Q. Cao, L. Shen, W. Xie, O. M. Parkhi, and A. Zisserman.
- The description is a dataset for facial recognition.
- The title is "VGGFace2 dataset."
- The issued year is 2018.
- The language is English.
- The identifier is empty.
- The theme is Computer Vision and Facial Recognition.
- The keywords include facial recognition, pretraining.
- The landing page is empty.
- The format is Image.
- The task is Facial Recognition.

I'll now compile these into the required JSON format.
