Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract talks about vector representations of words and their interpretability, but doesn't mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses previous work on word vectors, including skip-grams and GloVe, but these are models, not datasets.

Moving on to the Experimental Settings section, I find that the authors used Wikipedia English articles to train their word vector models. This is a dataset, so I'll note that. The corpus details include 5.3M articles, 83M sentences, and 1.676B tokens. They also mention using the SimLex-999 dataset for word similarity evaluation and the TREC dataset for question classification. Additionally, they used the 20 Newsgroups dataset for topic classification and the NP bracketing dataset for noun phrase bracketing tasks.

In the Results section, they reference the same datasets used in their experiments. The references section at the end of the paper provides more details on these datasets, including authors and publication years where available.

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields. For each dataset, I'll extract the creator (if available), description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For the Wikipedia corpus, the creators are the Wikimedia Foundation, and the description includes the size and purpose. The SimLex-999 dataset is created by Felix Hill and others, used for word similarity. The TREC dataset is by the Text Retrieval Conference, used for question classification. The 20 Newsgroups dataset is a standard text classification dataset, and the NP bracketing dataset is used for syntactic tasks.

I'll ensure each dataset is accurately described based on the paper's usage and any available references. If a field isn't specified, I'll leave it empty.
