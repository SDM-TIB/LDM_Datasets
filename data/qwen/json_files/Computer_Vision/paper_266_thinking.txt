Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses GQ-STN, a one-shot grasp detection network based on the Spatial Transformer Network (STN). It mentions using the Dex-Net 2.0 dataset for training and evaluation.

Looking further into the paper, the Dex-Net 2.0 dataset is described in detail in section III-B. It's a large-scale simulated dataset for parallel-gripper grasping, containing 6.7 million grasps on pre-rendered depth images of 3D models. The models come from 3DNet and KIT datasets. The dataset has two versions: classification and detection. The authors used the detection version, which contains full-resolution depth images.

Additionally, the paper mentions the Jacquard dataset in section V-C. It's used for testing and contains dense grasp annotations. However, the exact details like creators, publication year, etc., aren't provided in the paper.

I'll structure the JSON response with the identified datasets, ensuring each field is filled based on the information available in the paper. For Dex-Net 2.0, I have creators, description, title, version, and keywords. For Jacquard, only the title and description are available.
