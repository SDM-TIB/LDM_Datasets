Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "FASPell: A Fast, Adaptable, Simple, Powerful Chinese Spell Checker Based On DAE-Decoder Paradigm" by Yuzhong Hong and others. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses a Chinese spell checker called FASPell, which uses a denoising autoencoder (DAE) and a decoder. It mentions that the model is evaluated on benchmark datasets from SIGHAN shared tasks and OCR data.

Looking into the sections, especially the experiments and results, I find references to datasets like T rn13, T rn14, T rn15, T st13, T st14, T st15, T rnocr, and T stocr. These are likely the benchmark datasets used for evaluation.

I'll check the references section to find more details about these datasets. The references include works by Wu et al. (2013), Yu et al. (2014), Tseng et al. (2015), and others. These are the sources where the datasets are originally described.

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields. For each dataset, I'll note the creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, themes, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

Since the datasets are from SIGHAN shared tasks, their creators are the authors of those respective papers. The descriptions are based on how the paper uses these datasets for spell checking. The language is Chinese, and the format is text. The tasks involve spell checking and error correction.

I'll ensure that each dataset entry is accurate and follows the specified JSON structure without any additional text or explanations.
