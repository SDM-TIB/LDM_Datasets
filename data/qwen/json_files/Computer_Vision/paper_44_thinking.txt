Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Better Conversations by Modeling, Filtering, and Optimizing for Coherence and Diversity" by Xinnuo Xu, Ondřej Dušek, Ioannis Konstas, and Verena Rieser. It discusses improvements to encoder-decoder models for open-domain conversational agents, focusing on coherence and diversity.

In the introduction, they mention using large unlabeled datasets, but the specific datasets aren't named yet. Moving to the methodology section, they reference the OpenSubtitles corpus. This is a well-known dataset for dialogue generation, containing movie and TV subtitles.

Looking further, they mention using GloVe embeddings, which are pre-trained word vectors. The authors also reference the work of Pennington et al. (2014) for GloVe. Additionally, they mention using the OpenNMT-py framework, which is a tool for neural machine translation but not a dataset.

In the experiments section, they detail their training and evaluation on the OpenSubtitles corpus, specifically mentioning the versions used for training and testing. They also refer to the GloVe embeddings trained on the full OpenSubtitles corpus.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The main datasets used are OpenSubtitles and GloVe embeddings. I'll structure the JSON response accordingly, including metadata for each dataset as per the given vocabulary.
