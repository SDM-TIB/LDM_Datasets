Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks. These are likely datasets used for evaluation.

Moving to the introduction, there's a mention of the Transformer network achieving state-of-the-art results on the WMT 2014 tasks. So, WMT 2014 datasets are definitely used here.

In the experiments section, the authors benchmark their model on the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French tasks. They also mention the newstest2013 English-to-German task, which is another part of the WMT dataset.

Looking at the references, I find that the WMT datasets are cited, confirming their use in the paper.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset. The creators are the authors of the WMT datasets, which I can find in the references. The description will be based on how the paper uses these datasets for machine translation tasks. The titles are straightforward, and the issued year is 2014. The language is English and German/French. The format is text, and the tasks are machine translation.

I'll make sure each dataset is listed separately with their respective details.
