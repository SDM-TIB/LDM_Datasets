Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe them using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses probing neural language models for syntactic preferences between UD and SUD frameworks. It mentions using treebanks from UD and SUD for 13 languages. So, the main datasets here are the Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks and their Surface-Syntactic Universal Dependencies (SUD) conversions.

Next, I'll check the sections where datasets are explicitly mentioned. In the "Language and Treebank Selection" section, the authors mention using treebanks from UD v2.4 and their conversions into SUD. They also reference the multilingual BERT model and ELMo models, which are datasets in themselves.

Looking further, the paper references the AllenNLP library, which is used for implementing the parsing algorithm. While AllenNLP is a tool, it's not a dataset, so I'll exclude it.

Now, I'll gather the details for each dataset:

1. **Universal Dependencies (UD) v2.4**: Created by Joakim Nivre and others, this dataset provides cross-linguistic treebanks. It's used for syntactic analysis and has multiple language versions.

2. **Surface-Syntactic Universal Dependencies (SUD)**: Developed by Kim Gerdes and others, this is an alternative to UD, focusing on surface structure. It's used alongside UD for comparison.

3. **Multilingual BERT**: Developed by Google, this dataset is a pre-trained language model used for various NLP tasks, including syntactic probing.

4. **ELMo Models**: Created by Peters et al., these are pre-trained models used for contextualized word embeddings, also applied in syntactic analysis.

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata fields. I'll ensure that the creators are correctly identified, descriptions are based on the paper's usage, and other fields like language, format, and tasks are accurately filled.

I need to be careful not to include the paper's authors as dataset creators unless they are explicitly mentioned as such. Also, I'll avoid including organizations as creators unless specified.

Finally, I'll structure the information into JSON format, ensuring each dataset is a separate entry with all relevant metadata fields.
