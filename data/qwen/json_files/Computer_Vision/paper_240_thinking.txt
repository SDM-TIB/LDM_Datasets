Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper introduces VisualBERT, a model for vision-and-language tasks. It mentions several datasets in the experiments section, which is where most of the datasets are likely to be listed.

Looking at the experiments section, I see references to VQA 2.0, VCR, NLVR2, and Flickr30K. These are the primary datasets used for evaluation. Additionally, the paper mentions COCO for pre-training, which is another important dataset.

Now, I'll go through each section to extract details about these datasets:

1. **VQA 2.0**: This is a dataset for visual question answering. It's mentioned in the experiments section and the references. The creators are Goyal et al., published in 2017. The dataset includes images and questions with answers.

2. **VCR**: Visual Commonsense Reasoning dataset. Created by Zellers et al., published in 2019. It involves questions that require visual commonsense reasoning.

3. **NLVR2**: Natural Language for Visual Reasoning dataset. Created by Suhr et al., published in 2019. It tests the ability to reason about images based on text.

4. **Flickr30K**: A dataset for grounding phrases in images. Created by Plummer et al., published in 2015. It includes images and captions with region-to-phrase annotations.

5. **COCO**: Microsoft COCO dataset, used for pre-training. Created by Chen et al., published in 2015. It's a large-scale dataset for image captioning and other tasks.

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata fields:

- **dcterms:creator**: The authors of the dataset as listed in the references.
- **dcterms:description**: A brief description based on how the paper uses or describes the dataset.
- **dcterms:title**: The name of the dataset.
- **dcterms:issued**: The publication year from the references.
- **dcterms:language**: Typically English, as the datasets are described in English.
- **dcterms:identifier**: DOI or URL if available; some datasets might have these.
- **dcat:theme**: Categories like Computer Vision, Image Captioning, etc.
- **dcat:keyword**: Relevant keywords based on the dataset's use.
- **dcat:landingPage**: URL if provided.
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Version if mentioned.
- **dcterms:format**: Usually Text and Image for these datasets.
- **mls:task**: The tasks the dataset is used for, like Visual Question Answering.

I'll ensure that each dataset is accurately described and that all fields are filled based on the information available in the paper and its references.
