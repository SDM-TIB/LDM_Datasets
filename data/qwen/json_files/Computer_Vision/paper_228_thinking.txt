Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Graph Transformer Networks" by Seongjun Yun, Minbyul Jeong, Raehyun Kim, Jaewoo Kang, and Hyunwoo J. Kim. It's about graph neural networks and their application to heterogeneous graphs.

Looking through the abstract, the authors mention using benchmark datasets for node classification. In the introduction, they reference various graph datasets like social networks, citation networks, and functional brain structures. However, these are general categories, not specific datasets.

In the "Datasets" section under the experiments, the authors specify three datasets: DBLP, ACM, and IMDB. These are all heterogeneous graph datasets used for node classification tasks. 

DBLP and ACM are citation networks, while IMDB is a movie dataset. Each dataset has multiple node and edge types, and they're used to evaluate the performance of the proposed Graph Transformer Networks.

I need to extract metadata for each of these datasets. The creators are the authors of the datasets, but since the paper doesn't provide specific references for these datasets, I can't assign creators. The descriptions are based on how the authors used them. The titles are straightforward. The issued year isn't provided, so it's empty. The language is English as the datasets are described in English. Identifiers, landing pages, versions, formats, and tasks are filled based on the information available.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring that only the datasets mentioned in the paper are included.
