Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper's title is "Error correction and extraction in request dialogs" by Stefan Constantin and Alex Waibel. The abstract mentions a dialog system utility component that detects error corrections. It also refers to the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset, which is used for evaluating the approaches.

Looking into the introduction, the authors discuss error corrections in dialogs and mention the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset as the basis for their dataset. The dataset is described in more detail in the "3 Dataset" section.

In the "3 Dataset" section, the authors explain that their dataset is based on the annotations from the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset. They mention that this dataset comprises 100 hours of kitchen environment recordings with annotations for actions, verbs, and entities. They also describe how they modified this dataset for their error correction task, including synthetic corrections and human-created test data.

The references section includes citations for the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset, specifically citing Damen et al., 2020 and 2022.

So, the only dataset mentioned in this paper is the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset. I need to extract its metadata based on the information provided in the paper.

The creators of the dataset are listed in the references as Dima Damen, Hazel Doughty, Giovanni Maria Farinella, Sanja Fidler, Antonino Furnari, Evangelos Kazakos, Davide Moltisanti, Jonathan Munro, Toby Perrett, Will Price, and Michael Wray.

The description of the dataset is that it's a collection of 100 hours of kitchen environment recordings with annotations for actions, verbs, and entities. The authors modified it for their error correction task.

The title is "EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset."

The issued year is 2020, as per the reference.

The language is English, as it's a standard dataset in the field.

The identifier is the DOI from the reference: 10.1109/TPAMI.2020.3014797.

The themes are Computer Vision and Human Action Recognition.

Keywords include kitchen environment, human actions, annotations, error correction, and request dialogs.

The landing page is the DOI link.

The format is Video and Text, as it includes video recordings and textual annotations.

The task is Error Correction and Request Dialog Processing.

Now, I'll structure this information into the required JSON format.
