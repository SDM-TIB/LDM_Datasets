Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let's go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper is about Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs) and their applications in various tasks.

Looking at the introduction and methodology, I don't immediately see any datasets mentioned. The focus is more on the architecture of QRNNs and their advantages over traditional RNNs and CNNs.

Moving on to the experiments section, I find three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **IMDb movie review dataset**: This is a sentiment classification dataset with 25,000 positive and 25,000 negative reviews. It's divided into train and test sets with an average document length of 231 words.

2. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: Used for language modeling, it's a standard dataset preprocessed by Mikolov et al. (2010).

3. **IWSLT German-English spoken-domain translation dataset**: Consists of 209,772 sentence pairs from TED and TEDx presentations, with a mean sentence length of 103 characters for German and 93 for English.

Now, I'll gather metadata for each dataset:

- **IMDb dataset**: Created by Maas et al. (2011). Description includes sentiment classification, balanced samples, and average document length. Language is English. Format is text. Tasks include sentiment classification.

- **Penn Treebank**: Created by Mikolov et al. (2010). Used for language modeling, preprocessed. Language is English. Format is text. Tasks include language modeling.

- **IWSLT German-English**: Created by Ranzato et al. (2016). Focus on character-level translation, spoken-domain. Language is German and English. Format is text. Tasks include machine translation.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring all relevant information is included.
