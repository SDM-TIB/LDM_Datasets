Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The abstract mentions that the paper evaluates models on three conversational datasets: MojiTalk, PersonaChat, and Empathetic-Dialogues. These are the primary datasets used.

Next, I'll check the sections where datasets are described in detail. In the "5.1 Dataset" section, the authors elaborate on each dataset:

1. **MojiTalk**: This dataset consists of Twitter posts and responses labeled with emojis. It's used for generating responses with specific emotions. The authors reference Zhou and Wang (2018) for this dataset.

2. **PersonaChat**: This dataset involves multi-turn conversations centered around personas. The authors cite Zhang et al. (2018) as the source.

3. **Empathetic-Dialogues**: This dataset focuses on conversations where one speaker shares a situation, and the other responds empathetically. The authors reference Rashkin et al. (2019).

I'll also check the references section to find the full citations for these datasets to extract the necessary metadata.

For each dataset, I'll gather the following information:

- **dcterms:creator**: The authors who created the dataset.
- **dcterms:description**: A brief description of the dataset based on the paper's usage.
- **dcterms:title**: The name of the dataset.
- **dcterms:issued**: The year the dataset was published.
- **dcterms:language**: The language of the dataset (English in this case).
- **dcterms:identifier**: DOI or URL if available (not provided in the paper).
- **dcat:theme**: Thematic categories like conversation, dialogue, etc.
- **dcat:keyword**: Relevant keywords.
- **dcat:landingPage**: URL if available (not provided).
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Specific version if mentioned (not mentioned).
- **dcterms:format**: Format of the dataset (text).
- **mls:task**: Tasks the dataset is used for, such as dialogue generation.

Now, I'll structure each dataset into the required JSON format based on the information gathered.
