Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction sections. The abstract mentions the WikiText-103 and Google Billion Words datasets. These are likely the main datasets used in the study.

Next, I'll check the "4.1. Datasets" section in the paper. This section explicitly lists the datasets used: WikiText-103 and Google Billion Word. It provides details about each, such as their sizes and structures.

For each dataset, I need to extract the required metadata fields. Let's start with WikiText-103.

WikiText-103 is described as a dataset with over 100 million tokens and a vocabulary of about 200,000 words. It's used for language modeling, conditioning on entire paragraphs. The authors mention that it's a smaller dataset compared to Google Billion Words but allows for larger contexts.

Now, the Google Billion Words dataset is noted as one of the largest language modeling datasets, containing almost one billion tokens with a vocabulary over 800,000 words. It's based on an English corpus of 30 million sentences, shuffled to avoid bias.

I'll also check the references section for any additional details or citations related to these datasets. However, the paper doesn't provide DOIs or URLs for these datasets, so those fields will remain empty.

Finally, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset according to the specified vocabulary, ensuring all relevant fields are filled based on the information provided in the paper.
