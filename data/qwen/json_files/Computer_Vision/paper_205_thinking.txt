Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about text-to-image GANs with BERT, and it's authored by Trevor Tsuettsue, Jason Li, and Samir Sen. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets they used. The abstract mentions exploring text-to-image generation using GANs and BERT embeddings. In the introduction, they talk about the challenges in text-to-image generation and mention applications like computer-aided design and art generation. 

Moving on to the Data section (section 3), they explicitly mention the dataset they used: the 2011 Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset, also known as CUB-200. This dataset contains 11,788 images of 200 bird species and includes 10 text descriptions for each image. They downloaded these descriptions from a GitHub repository. 

I need to extract metadata for this dataset. The creators are the authors of the CUB-200 dataset, which, according to the paper, are Wah et al. (2011). The description should include the number of images, species, and the text descriptions. The title is "CUB-200". The year it was published is 2011. 

Since the dataset contains images and text descriptions, the format would be both Image and Text. The themes are Computer Vision and Image Generation. Keywords include Birds, Text-to-Image, and Image Generation. The landing page is the GitHub repository mentioned, but since it's not provided, I'll leave it empty. 

There's no specific version mentioned, so hasVersion is empty. The tasks this dataset is used for include Text-to-Image Generation and Image Captioning. 

I should structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring all fields are correctly filled based on the metadata vocabulary provided.
