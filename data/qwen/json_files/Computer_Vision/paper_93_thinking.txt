Alright, I'm trying to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about few-shot learning using embedding adaptation with set-to-set functions, specifically using a model called FEAT (Few-shot Embedding Adaptation with Transformer). 

First, I'll go through the paper section by section to identify any datasets that are mentioned. 

In the abstract, the authors mention "few-shot learning" and "standard few-shot classification benchmark." This suggests they might be using well-known datasets in the field. 

Looking at the introduction, they reference "few-shot visual recognition" and mention datasets like MiniImageNet and TieredImageNet. These are standard datasets used in few-shot learning research. 

In the experiments section, they provide more details about the datasets they used. They mention MiniImageNet, TieredImageNet, and OfficeHome. 

- **MiniImageNet**: This is a subset of ImageNet with 100 classes, often used for few-shot learning tasks. 
- **TieredImageNet**: Another dataset from ImageNet, structured into different tiers for training, validation, and testing. 
- **OfficeHome**: A dataset containing images from four different domains, used for domain adaptation tasks.

The authors also mention CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds dataset) in the supplementary material, which is another dataset used for few-shot learning, especially for bird species classification.

Each of these datasets is described in terms of their structure, usage, and how they were split into training, validation, and test sets. The datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the FEAT model in various few-shot learning scenarios, including cross-domain and generalized few-shot learning.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the specified metadata vocabulary.
