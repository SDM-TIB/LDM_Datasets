Alright, I'm trying to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "All-in-One Image-Grounded Conversational Agents" and is authored by Da Jua, Kurt Shuster, Y-Lan Boureau, and Jason Weston from Facebook AI Research. 

First, I'll start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned. I'll look for sections where datasets are referenced, such as in the introduction, methods, experiments, and references.

In the introduction, the authors mention several datasets related to image captioning, visual question answering, and dialogue tasks. Specifically, they reference COCO Captions, Flickr30k, Personality Captions, Image Chat, Image Chat QA, VQA, and IGCQ and IGCQA datasets.

Moving to the tasks section, the authors detail the datasets used for language-based, vision-based, and vision+language tasks. For language-based tasks, they mention Wikipedia and Toronto Books, as well as Reddit data. For vision-based tasks, they reference ImageNet, Instagram images, and Visual Genome. For vision+language tasks, they again mention COCO Captions, Flickr30k, Personality Captions, Image Chat, Image Chat QA, VQA, and IGCQ and IGCQA.

In the experiments section, the authors provide a table (Table 1) that lists all the datasets used, including their sizes and purposes. This table is a comprehensive source of information about the datasets.

I'll now list out all the datasets mentioned:

1. COCO Captions
2. Flickr30k
3. Personality Captions
4. Image Chat
5. Image Chat QA
6. VQA
7. IGCQ
8. IGCQA
9. Wikipedia and Toronto Books
10. Reddit
11. ImageNet
12. Instagram images
13. Visual Genome

For each dataset, I need to extract the metadata fields as specified. I'll go through each dataset one by one.

Starting with COCO Captions, the authors reference Chen et al., 2015. From the paper, I can gather that COCO Captions is a dataset for image captioning, containing about 83k training images and 414k captions. The creators are the authors of the referenced paper, which is Chen et al. The description is about image captioning, the title is COCO Captions, the year is 2015, the language is English, the identifier is the reference, the theme is image captioning, keywords include image, caption, etc., the landing page is the reference URL, no version is mentioned, the format is text, and the task is image captioning.

I'll follow a similar process for each dataset, extracting the relevant information from the paper and the references provided. For datasets like Wikipedia and Toronto Books, the creators are the authors of those resources, and the description is about large text corpora used for pre-training.

For ImageNet, the creators are Deng et al., the description is about a large image dataset, the year is 2009, and so on.

I'll ensure that each dataset's metadata is accurately extracted based on the information provided in the paper. If some details are not explicitly mentioned, I'll leave those fields empty or use placeholders as needed.

Finally, I'll compile all the datasets into a JSON format, ensuring that each dataset is represented with the correct metadata fields as specified.
