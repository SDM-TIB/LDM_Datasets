Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The abstract mentions the Hands 2017 challenge dataset and the NYU dataset. These are two datasets that I need to note down.

Next, I'll look into the sections where datasets are discussed in detail. In the introduction, the paper references several datasets, but the main ones used are the Hands 2017 challenge dataset and the NYU dataset. 

Looking further into the paper, under the "III. DATASET PROCESSING" section, the authors describe their experiments on the Hands 2017 challenge dataset and the NYU dataset. They also mention the BigHand 2.2M dataset and the First-person Hand Action Dataset (FHAD) as part of the Hands 2017 challenge dataset.

I'll need to gather metadata for each of these datasets. For each dataset, I'll extract the required fields such as creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For the Hands 2017 challenge dataset, the creators are listed in the references as S. Yuan, Q. Ye, B. Stenger, S. Jain, and T.-K. Kim. The description mentions it's a large dataset with images from BigHand 2.2M and FHAD. The themes are Computer Vision and Hand Pose Estimation. Keywords include hand pose estimation, depth images, and benchmark. The format is images.

The NYU dataset is created by J. Tompson, M. Stein, Y. Lecun, and K. Perlin. It's used for evaluating hand pose estimation with 3D joint locations. Themes are similar, and keywords include hand tracking and 3D reconstruction.

BigHand 2.2M is created by S. Yuan, Q. Ye, B. Stenger, S. Jain, and T.-K. Kim. It's a large dataset for hand pose estimation, with themes in Computer Vision and Hand Tracking.

FHAD is created by G. Garcia-Hernando, S. Yuan, S. Baek, and T.-K. Kim. It includes RGB-D videos and 3D hand pose annotations, used for evaluating hand tracking.

I'll structure each dataset with the appropriate metadata, ensuring all fields are filled based on the information provided in the paper. If some fields aren't mentioned, I'll leave them empty.
