Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper is about VL-BERT, a pre-trained model for visual-linguistic tasks. It mentions several datasets used for pre-training and evaluation.

1. **Conceptual Captions Dataset**: This is mentioned in the pre-training section. It's a large-scale dataset with images and captions. The authors reference Sharma et al., 2018.

2. **BooksCorpus**: Used alongside Conceptual Captions for pre-training. It's a text corpus from books. The reference is Zhu et al., 2015.

3. **English Wikipedia**: Also used for pre-training, providing text data. No specific reference is given, but it's a well-known dataset.

4. **VCR (Visual Commonsense Reasoning) Dataset**: Used for evaluation. The authors reference Zellers et al., 2019.

5. **VQA (Visual Question Answering) Dataset**: Specifically VQA v2.0, referenced by Goyal et al., 2017.

6. **RefCOCO+ Dataset**: Used for referring expression comprehension. The reference is Kazemzadeh et al., 2014.

7. **COCO (Common Objects in Context) Dataset**: Mentioned in the context of RefCOCO+. The reference is Lin et al., 2014.

8. **Visual Genome Dataset**: Used for object detection. The reference is Krishna et al., 2017.

Now, I'll gather metadata for each dataset:

- **Conceptual Captions**: Creators are Sharma et al., description about images and captions, published in 2018, language English, format image and text, themes computer vision and NLP, keywords include images, captions, etc.

- **BooksCorpus**: Creators Zhu et al., description about books, published in 2015, language English, format text, themes NLP, keywords books, text.

- **English Wikipedia**: Creators are the Wikimedia community, description about encyclopedia, published in 2001, language English, format text, themes NLP, keywords encyclopedia, text.

- **VCR**: Creators Zellers et al., description about visual commonsense, published in 2019, language English, format image and text, themes computer vision, keywords questions, answers.

- **VQA v2.0**: Creators Goyal et al., description about visual questions, published in 2017, language English, format image and text, themes computer vision, keywords questions, answers.

- **RefCOCO+**: Creators Kazemzadeh et al., description about referring expressions, published in 2014, language English, format image and text, themes computer vision, keywords referring expressions.

- **COCO**: Creators Lin et al., description about common objects, published in 2014, language English, format image and text, themes computer vision, keywords objects.

- **Visual Genome**: Creators Krishna et al., description about visual genome, published in 2017, language English, format image and text, themes computer vision, keywords objects, relationships.

I'll structure each dataset into the required JSON format, ensuring all metadata fields are filled appropriately. If any information is missing, I'll leave the field empty as per instructions.
