Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "ssEMnet: Serial-section Electron Microscopy Image Registration using a Spatial Transformer Network with Learned Features." It discusses methods for aligning serial-section electron microscopy (ssEM) images to reconstruct neuronal circuits.

In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method across several datasets but don't name them yet. Moving to the introduction, they refer to ssEM datasets but don't specify names. 

Looking at the results section, I find three datasets mentioned:

1. **Drosophila TEM data**: This is a transmission electron microscopy dataset of the Drosophila melanogaster brain. It's used to demonstrate the alignment method's effectiveness.

2. **Labeled Drosophila TEM data from CREMI challenge**: This dataset is part of the CREMI (Challenge on Registration of EM Images) challenge. It's used for quantitative assessment with ground truth labels.

3. **Mouse lateral geniculate nucleus SEM data**: A scanning electron microscopy dataset from the mouse brain, containing fold artifacts. It's used to test the method's robustness against such artifacts.

I need to extract metadata for each dataset. The creators are the authors of the datasets, but since the paper doesn't provide explicit references for these datasets, I can't assign specific creators. The descriptions are based on how the paper uses them. The titles are taken directly from the paper. No issue dates, languages, identifiers, themes, keywords, landing pages, versions, formats, or tasks are explicitly mentioned beyond what's inferred from their usage in the paper.

So, I'll structure each dataset with the available information, leaving fields empty where data isn't provided.
