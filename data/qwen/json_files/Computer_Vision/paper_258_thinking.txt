Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper introduces DeSTNet, a densely fused spatial transformer network, and mentions experiments on three benchmarks: MNIST, GTSRB, and IDocDB.

Next, I'll look into the methodology and experiments sections for more details on these datasets.

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   - Mentioned in the experiments section as a benchmark for image classification.
   - Description: Handwritten digits dataset with 60,000 training and 10,000 test images.
   - Used for evaluating the model's performance under perspective transformations.

2. **GTSRB Dataset**:
   - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark.
   - Includes 39,209 training and 12,630 test images of 43 traffic signs.
   - Used to assess the model's ability to handle real-world conditions and transformations.

3. **IDocDB Dataset**:
   - A non-public dataset of official identity documents.
   - Contains 1,000 training and 500 test images of UK Driving Licences.
   - Used for document alignment tasks under challenging conditions like occlusions and varying resolutions.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the metadata fields:

- **dcterms:creator**: Look for authors in the dataset's reference. For MNIST, it's Yann LeCun. GTSRB is cited as Stallkamp et al. IDocDB isn't cited, so creators are unknown.
- **dcterms:description**: Summarize each dataset's purpose and content as described in the paper.
- **dcterms:title**: Use the dataset's name.
- **dcterms:issued**: Find the publication year from references. MNIST is 1998, GTSRB 2011, IDocDB not specified.
- **dcterms:language**: Not applicable for image datasets.
- **dcterms:identifier**: Look for DOIs or URLs. MNIST has a URL, others don't.
- **dcat:theme**: Categories like Computer Vision, Document Analysis.
- **dcat:keyword**: Relevant tags like handwritten digits, traffic signs, document alignment.
- **dcat:landingPage**: URLs where available.
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Not mentioned.
- **dcterms:format**: Image.
- **mls:task**: Tasks like classification, alignment.

I'll ensure each dataset is accurately described based on the paper's usage and available references.
