Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses embedding probabilistic programming in a deep learning ecosystem using TensorFlow. It mentions applications like VAEs, Image Transformers, and NUTS.

Looking through the sections, I find references to datasets in the experiments section. Specifically, they mention:

1. **64x64 ImageNet**: Used for a vector-quantized VAE.
2. **256x256 CelebA-HQ**: Used for an Image Transformer.
3. **Covertype dataset**: Used for evaluating the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS).

I'll need to gather metadata for each of these datasets. However, the paper doesn't provide detailed information about the creators, descriptions, or other metadata for these datasets. 

For each dataset, I'll note what's available:

- **64x64 ImageNet**: Description from the paper, but no creator or other details.
- **256x256 CelebA-HQ**: Description from the paper, no creator info.
- **Covertype dataset**: Description from the paper, no creator info.

Since the paper doesn't provide creators, identifiers, or other metadata, those fields will be empty. The themes, keywords, and tasks are based on how the datasets are used in the paper.
