Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper introduces Graph Informer Networks, which are applied to tasks like predicting 13C NMR spectra, drug bioactivity, and toxicity. It mentions datasets like NMRShiftDB2, ChEMBL, and MoleculeNet's Tox21.

Next, I'll look into the methodology and results sections for more details on the datasets. The paper uses NMRShiftDB2 for NMR spectrum prediction, ChEMBL for drug bioactivity, and Tox21 for toxicity prediction. Each of these datasets is described in the context of their use in the experiments.

Now, I'll extract the metadata for each dataset:

1. **NMRShiftDB2**: Used for 13C NMR spectrum prediction. The creators are from the University of Cologne. The dataset is described as containing 13C NMR spectra. It was published in 2019, and the landing page is provided.

2. **ChEMBL**: A database for drug bioactivity data. The creators are from the European Bioinformatics Institute. It was published in 2014, and the landing page is provided.

3. **Tox21**: A dataset from MoleculeNet for toxicity prediction. The creators are from the University of Toronto. It was published in 2018, and the landing page is provided.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring that all relevant information is included. If any fields aren't specified in the paper, I'll leave them empty.
