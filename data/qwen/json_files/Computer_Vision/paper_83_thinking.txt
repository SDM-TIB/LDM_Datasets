Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper introduces OPTIMUS, a large-scale pre-trained deep latent variable model for natural language processing. It mentions using Wikipedia for pre-training and evaluates on several datasets.

Looking at the sections, I see references to datasets like Penn Treebank (PTB), SNLI, Yahoo, Yelp, DailyDialog, and GLUE. Each of these datasets is used for different tasks such as language modeling, sentiment analysis, and dialog response generation.

I'll list each dataset and gather the necessary details:

1. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: Used for language modeling. It's a standard corpus for NLP tasks.
2. **SNLI**: A corpus for natural language inference.
3. **Yahoo and Yelp**: Used for sentiment analysis and language modeling.
4. **DailyDialog**: A dataset for dialog response generation.
5. **GLUE**: A benchmark for general language understanding.

For each dataset, I'll extract the creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, themes, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

I'll ensure that the creators are correctly identified from the references. For example, PTB is created by Marcus et al., and GLUE by Wang et al.

I'll also note the language as English for all datasets since they're used in an English NLP context.

Finally, I'll structure each dataset into the required JSON format, ensuring all fields are filled accurately based on the information extracted from the paper.
