Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper introduces LXMERT, a framework for vision-and-language tasks. It mentions datasets used for evaluation, such as VQA, GQA, and NLVR2. These are likely the main datasets.

Next, I'll look into the sections where datasets are discussed in detail. In the "Experimental Setup and Results" section, the authors mention VQA v2.0, GQA, and NLVR2. They also reference other datasets used for pre-training, such as COCO, Visual Genome, and VG-QA.

I'll need to gather details about each dataset, including their creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, languages, identifiers, themes, keywords, landing pages, versions, formats, and tasks.

For each dataset, I'll check the references section to find the creators and publication years. For example, VQA v2.0 is cited as Antol et al., 2015, and GQA as Hudson and Manning, 2019.

I'll structure each dataset entry according to the metadata fields, ensuring that all required information is included. If some details aren't explicitly mentioned, I'll leave those fields empty.

Finally, I'll compile all the datasets into a JSON format, making sure each entry is correctly formatted and all necessary fields are populated based on the information extracted from the paper.
