Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper is about recurrent transformer networks for semantic correspondence, which involves image matching tasks. 

Looking through the sections, I notice that the authors evaluate their method on several benchmarks. In Section 5.3, they mention the TSS benchmark, PF-WILLOW dataset, and PF-PASCAL dataset. 

For each dataset, I need to extract the metadata. 

1. **TSS Benchmark**: It's from Taniai et al. (2016). The description mentions it's used for semantic correspondence, including car models, JODS, and PASCAL. The themes are Computer Vision and Image Matching. Keywords include semantic correspondence, image matching, and benchmark.

2. **PF-WILLOW Dataset**: From Ham et al. (2016). It's used for semantic correspondence with object proposals. Themes are Computer Vision and Object Detection. Keywords include semantic correspondence, object proposals, and benchmark.

3. **PF-PASCAL Dataset**: Also from Ham et al. (2016). It's used for semantic correspondence with PASCAL keypoint annotations. Themes are Computer Vision and Image Matching. Keywords include semantic correspondence, image matching, and benchmark.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring all information is accurate based on the paper's description.
