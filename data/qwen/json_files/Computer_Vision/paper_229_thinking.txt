Alright, I'm trying to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper is about adaptively sparse Transformers, which use a different attention mechanism called I-entmax. They mention that their models were trained on four machine translation datasets.

Looking further into the paper, under the "Datasets" section, they list the datasets used:

1. **IWSLT 2017 German-English (DE-EN)**: This dataset has 200K sentence pairs.
2. **KFTT Japanese-English (JA-EN)**: It contains 300K sentence pairs.
3. **WMT 2016 Romanian-English (RO-EN)**: This dataset has 600K sentence pairs.
4. **WMT 2014 English-German (EN-DE)**: It includes 4.5M sentence pairs.

Each of these datasets is used for training and evaluating their Transformer models. The datasets are all machine translation datasets, focusing on different language pairs.

Now, I need to extract the metadata for each dataset. The creators are the authors of the datasets, which I can find in the references. However, the paper doesn't provide explicit references for these datasets, so I'll assume the creators are the ones mentioned in the dataset names (e.g., IWSLT, KFTT, WMT).

The description for each dataset is based on how they were used in the paper: for training and evaluating machine translation models. The language is specified in the dataset name. The format is text, as they are sentence pairs. The tasks involve machine translation.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring that each field is filled appropriately based on the information provided in the paper.
