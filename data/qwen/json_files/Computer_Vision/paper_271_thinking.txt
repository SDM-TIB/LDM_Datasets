Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses data augmentation techniques using a combination of spatial transformations and encoder-decoder architectures. It mentions experiments on several datasets.

In the datasets section (4.1), the paper explicitly lists the datasets used:
- MNIST
- SVHN (Street View House Numbers)
- CIFAR-10
- Fashion-MNIST

Each of these datasets is described in terms of their content and usage in the experiments. I'll need to gather metadata for each.

For each dataset, I'll extract the following information:
- **dcterms:creator**: The authors or creators of the dataset.
- **dcterms:description**: A brief description of the dataset as used in the paper.
- **dcterms:title**: The name of the dataset.
- **dcterms:issued**: The year the dataset was published.
- **dcterms:language**: The language of the dataset (if applicable).
- **dcterms:identifier**: DOI or URL if available.
- **dcat:theme**: Thematic categories.
- **dcat:keyword**: Relevant keywords.
- **dcat:landingPage**: URL for accessing the dataset.
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Specific version if mentioned.
- **dcterms:format**: Format of the data.
- **mls:task**: Tasks for which the dataset is used.

I'll go through each dataset one by one.

1. **MNIST**:

3. **CIFAR-10**:
   - Created by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E. Hinton.
   - Description: Dataset of 10 classes of color images.
   - Published in 2009.
   - Theme: Computer Vision, Image Classification.
   - Keywords: Image classification, Object recognition.

4. **Fashion-MNIST**:
   - Created by Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf.
   - Description: Fashion article dataset.
   - Published in 2017.
   - Theme: Computer Vision, Fashion.
   - Keywords: Fashion, Classification.

I'll ensure that each dataset's metadata is accurately captured based on the information provided in the paper and any available references. If any information is missing, I'll leave it as an empty string or list as per the instructions.
