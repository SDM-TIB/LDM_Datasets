Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about cybersecurity text analysis using neural networks, specifically focusing on tasks related to malware text classification and token labeling. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the MalwareTextDB corpus. Then, in the introduction, it's stated that SemEval-2018 Task 8 uses this corpus. 

Looking further into the paper, the dataset is described as consisting of APT reports taken from APTnotes. The preprocessing steps mention using tools like Stanford CoreNLP, Keras, and others, but these are tools, not datasets. 

I also check the references section for any other datasets, but it seems that the only dataset explicitly mentioned is MalwareTextDB. There's no other dataset cited or referred to in the paper. 

So, the only dataset to extract is MalwareTextDB. I'll gather the metadata as per the instructions: the creator is Lim et al., the description is based on how the paper uses it, the title is MalwareTextDB, the year is 2017, the language is English, and the themes and keywords are related to cybersecurity and text analysis. The landing page URL is provided in the paper.
