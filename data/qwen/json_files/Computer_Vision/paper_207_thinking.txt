Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The abstract mentions using Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow models, but doesn't specify datasets. The introduction discusses TTS models and their performance, but again, no datasets are named here.

Moving on to the methods section, specifically section 3.1, the paper describes the stimuli used for testing tonal coarticulation and tone sandhi. These stimuli were created by the authors, so they might not be datasets but rather custom inputs for the experiments.

In section 3.2, the paper mentions using Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow models. Tacotron 2 is a model, not a dataset. WaveGlow is another model, so no dataset here either.

Looking at section 4.1 under experiments, the paper states that the training data for both Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow was the Chinese Standard Mandarin Speech Corpus (CSMSC). This is a clear mention of a dataset. The paper provides a URL for CSMSC: https://www.data-baker.com/open source.html.

The authors also reference other studies and datasets in the references, but I need to focus only on those mentioned in the paper. The CSMSC is the primary dataset used for training the models.

I should check if there are any other datasets mentioned elsewhere. Scanning through the rest of the paper, I don't find any additional datasets. The stimuli used in the experiments are custom and not datasets per se.

So, the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper is the Chinese Standard Mandarin Speech Corpus (CSMSC). I'll extract its metadata based on the information provided.
