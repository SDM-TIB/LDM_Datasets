Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses a Projective Spatial Transformer module for 2D/3D registration, particularly using CT scans and radiographs. It mentions experiments using CT scans from the NIH Cancer Imaging Archive and real X-ray images from a cadaver specimen.

Next, I'll examine the methodology and experiments sections. In the experiments, they mention using 17 full-body CT scans from the NIH Cancer Imaging Archive for training and one for testing. They also collected 10 real X-ray images from a cadaver, with ground truth poses obtained using metallic BBs and manual annotation.

Looking at the references, I find that the datasets are cited as:
1. NIH Cancer Imaging Archive (reference 12)
2. Real X-ray study (reference 12 as well, but it's a different dataset)

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields. For each dataset, I'll extract the creator, description, title, issued year, language, identifier, theme, keyword, landing page, version, format, and task.

For the NIH dataset, the creators are the authors of the paper, but since the dataset is from the NIH, I might need to check if they are the creators. However, the paper doesn't specify, so I'll list the authors as creators. The description is based on how the paper uses the dataset. The title is the dataset's name. The issued year is when the dataset was published, which isn't explicitly stated, so I'll leave it empty. Language isn't applicable here. The identifier is the NIH link. The theme is medical imaging. Keywords include CT scans, registration, and NIH. The landing page is the NIH URL. Format is medical imaging data. The task is 2D/3D registration.

For the real X-ray dataset, the creators are the authors of the paper. The description is based on their use. The title is "Real X-ray Study." The issued year isn't provided. Language isn't applicable. Identifier is empty. Theme is medical imaging. Keywords include X-ray, registration, cadaver. Landing page is empty. Format is medical imaging. Task is 2D/3D registration.

I need to ensure that each field is correctly filled based on the information available in the paper. If a field isn't mentioned, I'll leave it empty or as an empty list.
