Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper on BART. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The abstract mentions BART's evaluation on several tasks, including GLUE and SQuAD. So, GLUE and SQuAD are definitely datasets used here.

Moving to the sections, I see that in Section 4, the authors compare their model with others on tasks like SQuAD, MNLI, ELI5, XSum, ConvAI2, and CNN/DM. These are all datasets. Additionally, they mention the XSum dataset in more detail, which is a news summarization dataset.

In Section 5, they discuss large-scale pre-training experiments and mention using the same data as RoBERTa, which includes news, books, stories, and web text. However, this is more about the pre-training corpus rather than a specific dataset.

Looking at the references, I find citations for GLUE, SQuAD, XSum, and others. Each of these is a well-known dataset in NLP.

So, compiling all the datasets mentioned:

1. GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation)
2. SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)
3. MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)
4. ELI5 (Explain It Like I'm Five)
5. XSum (Extreme Summarization)
6. ConvAI2 (Conversational AI 2)
7. CNN/DM (CNN/DailyMail)

Each of these datasets is used for evaluating BART on different tasks like question answering, summarization, and dialogue response generation.

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields based on the information provided in the paper.
