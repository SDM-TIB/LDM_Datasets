Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Argumentative Link Prediction using Residual Networks and Multi-Objective Learning" by Andrea Galassi, Marco Lippi, and Paolo Torroni. The abstract mentions evaluating their model on a challenging dataset consisting of user-generated comments from an online platform. This suggests that the dataset is related to argumentation mining.

Looking into the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges in argument structure prediction and mention that their method does not rely on domain-specific knowledge. They reference the Cornell eRulemaking Corpus (CDCP) in the benchmark section.

In the benchmark section (Section 4.1), the dataset is explicitly mentioned as the Cornell eRulemaking Corpus (CDCP). It consists of 731 user comments from a eRule-making website, with about 4,700 propositions. The dataset is used for evaluating their model against state-of-the-art methods.

The references section provides more details about the CDCP dataset. It was introduced by Niculae et al. in 2017, and it's used for argumentation mining tasks, particularly for link prediction and proposition classification.

I need to extract the metadata for the CDCP dataset. The creators are the authors of the dataset, which from the reference is Vlad Niculae, Joonsuk Park, and Claire Cardie. The description is based on how the paper describes the dataset: user-generated comments from an online platform, focusing on argumentative propositions and links. The title is "Cornell eRulemaking Corpus (CDCP)". The issued year is 2017. The language is English. The identifier is the DOI from the reference, which is 10.18653/v1/W17-2015. The themes are "Argumentation Mining" and "Natural Language Processing". The keywords include "Argumentative links", "Propositions", "User comments". The landing page is the URL from the reference. The format is text. The tasks include "Link Prediction" and "Argumentation Mining".

I should structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring all fields are correctly populated based on the dataset's description and usage in the paper.
