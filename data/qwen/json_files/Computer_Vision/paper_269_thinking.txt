Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about using contextual representations for suicide risk assessment from Reddit forums. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets are being used. The abstract mentions that the research is motivated by the CLPsych 2019 shared task and uses data from Reddit. 

Looking into the introduction, it specifically mentions the "University of Maryland Reddit Suicidality Dataset." This dataset was developed using data from Reddit, focusing on the r/SuicideWatch subreddit. The data includes post id, anonymous user id, timestamp, subreddit name, post title, and post body. The training data has four labels indicating the risk level, and there's a control group with no suicidality risk.

Next, I'll check the methods section to see if any other datasets are mentioned. The methods describe the preprocessing steps and the use of BERT models, but no additional datasets are referenced beyond the one already mentioned.

In the references, the paper cites the CLPsych 2019 shared task and the dataset developed by Shing et al. (2018). This confirms that the University of Maryland Reddit Suicidality Dataset is the primary dataset used in the research.

So, the only dataset mentioned in the paper is the University of Maryland Reddit Suicidality Dataset. I'll extract the metadata for this dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
