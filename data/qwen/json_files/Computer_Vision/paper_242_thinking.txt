Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses a novel image sampling method for differentiable image transformations, comparing it with existing methods. It mentions datasets used for experiments, which are detailed in the later sections.

Moving to the "Datasets" section under the "Results" section, the paper explicitly lists three datasets:

1. MNIST [22]
2. GTSRB [33]
3. Pascal VOC 2012 [13]

Each of these datasets is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The paper provides brief descriptions of how each dataset is used, such as for image classification tasks.

Next, I'll look up the references to gather more details about each dataset, including creators, publication years, and URLs if available.

For MNIST, it's a well-known dataset of handwritten digits created by Yann LeCun and colleagues in 1998. It's widely used for image classification tasks.

GTSRB stands for German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark. It was introduced by Stallkamp et al. in 2011 and is used for traffic sign classification.

Pascal VOC 2012 is part of the Pascal Visual Object Classes challenge, a dataset for object recognition and segmentation tasks, created by Everingham et al. in 2012.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the specified metadata vocabulary, ensuring all required fields are filled based on the information extracted from the paper and its references.
