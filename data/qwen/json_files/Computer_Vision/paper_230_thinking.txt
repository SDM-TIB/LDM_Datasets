Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses face recovery from stylized portraits, mentioning datasets like CelebA and CUFSF. 

In the methodology section, the authors describe using the Celebrity dataset (CelebA) for training and testing. They also mention hand-drawn sketches from the CUFSF dataset as an unseen style. 

Looking further, the authors reference the FaceNet model, which is pre-trained on a large dataset of face identities. Additionally, they mention the VGG-19 network pre-trained on ImageNet, though ImageNet isn't explicitly used in their experiments.

I should also check if any other datasets are mentioned, such as those used for evaluation or comparison. The authors compare their results with other methods but don't mention additional datasets beyond CelebA, CUFSF, FaceNet, and VGG-19.

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields. For CelebA, the creators are the authors who developed it, the description is about face images, and it's used for training and testing. CUFSF is about face sketches. FaceNet is for face recognition, and VGG-19 is a pre-trained model on ImageNet.

I need to ensure each dataset's metadata is accurate, including creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, themes, keywords, and formats. Since some details might not be explicitly provided, I'll infer based on the context given in the paper.

Finally, I'll compile all this information into the required JSON format, making sure each dataset is correctly represented with all the necessary fields.
