Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract talks about the Clued Recurrent Attention Model (CRAM) and mentions tasks like image classification and inpainting. It doesn't specify any datasets yet.

Moving on to the methodology section, I see that the authors used a convolutional deconvolutional network (CNN-DecNN) pre-trained on the MSRA10k dataset. MSRA10k is a dataset for saliency detection, containing 10,000 annotated images. This is one dataset.

Next, in the experiments section, the authors mention using the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset for image inpainting. SVHN contains images of house numbers, with a training set of 73,257 digits and a test set of 26,032 digits. This is the second dataset.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference these two datasets in their methodology and experiments, so they are the ones to include.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the provided vocabulary.

For MSRA10k:
- **Creator**: The authors of the dataset are mentioned in the reference as M.-M. Cheng, N. J. Mitra, X. Huang, P. H. Torr, and S.-M. Hu.
- **Description**: It's a dataset for saliency detection with 10,000 images.
- **Title**: MSRA10k.
- **Issued**: The year is 2015.
- **Theme**: Computer Vision, Saliency Detection.
- **Keywords**: Saliency detection, image processing.
- **Landing Page**: The URL is http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cslzhang Salvation/.
- **Format**: Image.
- **Task**: Saliency detection.

For SVHN:
- **Creator**: The authors are Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu, and A. Y. Ng.
- **Description**: A dataset of house numbers from Google Street View.
- **Title**: Street View House Numbers (SVHN).
- **Issued**: The year is 2011.
- **Theme**: Computer Vision, Object Recognition.
- **Keywords**: Image classification, object recognition.
- **Landing Page**: The URL is http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/.
- **Format**: Image.
- **Task**: Image classification.

I'll make sure each field is filled accurately based on the information provided in the paper.
