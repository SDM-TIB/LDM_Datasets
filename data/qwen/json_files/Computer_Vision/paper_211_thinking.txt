Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses person re-identification (ReID) using a multi-level similarity approach. It mentions datasets like CUHK03, CUHK01, and VIPeR. These are likely the main datasets used for experiments.

Next, I'll look into the "4. Experiments" section, specifically "4.1. Datasets and evaluation metrics." Here, the authors detail the datasets they used:

1. **CUHK03 detected and labeled**: This dataset is described as large, containing 13,164 images from 1,360 identities captured by 6 cameras. It has two kinds of pedestrian boxes: detected by algorithms and labeled manually.

2. **CUHK01**: A mid-sized dataset with 3,884 images of 971 identities.

3. **VIPeR**: A small dataset with 632 identities.

I'll also check the references section to find more details about these datasets, such as their creators, publication years, and any URLs or DOIs. However, the paper doesn't provide explicit DOIs or URLs for these datasets, so those fields will remain empty.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the metadata vocabulary:

- **dcterms:creator**: The authors of the datasets. For CUHK03, the creators are mentioned as [22], which refers to a specific citation in the paper. Similarly, CUHK01 is cited as [21], and VIPeR as [10]. I'll need to map these citation numbers to the authors' names from the references.

- **dcterms:description**: Based on how the paper describes each dataset.

- **dcterms:title**: The name of each dataset.

- **dcterms:issued**: The year the dataset was published, extracted from the references.

- **dcterms:language**: Not applicable as these are image datasets.

- **dcterms:identifier**: Empty since no DOIs or URLs are provided.

- **dcat:theme**: Categories like Computer Vision, Person Re-Identification.

- **dcat:keyword**: Relevant keywords such as Person ReID, Image dataset.

- **dcat:landingPage**: Empty as no URLs are provided.

- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Not mentioned.

- **dcterms:format**: Image.

- **mls:task**: Person Re-Identification.

I'll ensure each dataset is accurately described based on the information provided in the paper.
