Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The abstract mentions two datasets: TuSimple and ApolloScape. These are likely the main datasets used in the study.

Next, I'll check the methodology section to see how these datasets were utilized. The paper describes experiments conducted on both TuSimple and ApolloScape datasets for lane and road marking detection tasks.

Looking at the references, I find more details about these datasets. TuSimple is cited as [6], and ApolloScape as [7]. The references provide URLs for both datasets, which will be useful for the landing page metadata.

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata fields:

1. **dcterms:creator**: The authors of the datasets. For TuSimple, the creators are listed as the authors of the benchmark paper. For ApolloScape, the creators are the authors of the dataset paper.

2. **dcterms:description**: A brief description based on how the datasets are used in the paper. TuSimple is for lane detection, and ApolloScape includes various road markings.

3. **dcterms:title**: The name of each dataset.

4. **dcterms:issued**: The publication year of each dataset, found in the references.

5. **dcterms:language**: Not applicable as the datasets are image-based.

6. **dcterms:identifier**: The DOI or URL from the references.

7. **dcat:theme**: Thematic categories like Computer Vision and Autonomous Vehicles.

8. **dcat:keyword**: Relevant keywords such as lane detection, road markings, etc.

9. **dcat:landingPage**: The URLs provided in the references.

10. **dcterms:hasVersion**: Not mentioned in the paper.

11. **dcterms:format**: Image-based datasets.

12. **mls:task**: The tasks for which the datasets are used, such as semantic segmentation and instance segmentation.

I'll ensure that each dataset is accurately described based on the information provided in the paper and its references.
