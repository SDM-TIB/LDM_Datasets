Alright, I'm looking at the provided research paper on FastSpeech. The task is to extract all datasets mentioned and describe them using the specified metadata vocabulary. 

First, I'll scan through the paper to identify any datasets. The abstract mentions the LJSpeech dataset, which is used for experiments. 

Looking further, in the Experimental Setup section (4.1), the paper details the use of the LJSpeech dataset. It's described as containing 13,100 English audio clips with corresponding text transcripts, totaling about 24 hours of audio. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets. 

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The references include other works, but they don't introduce additional datasets used in this study. 

So, the only dataset identified is LJSpeech. I'll gather the necessary metadata for it, including the creator, description, title, year, and other relevant fields as specified.
