Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Semi-Supervised Semantic Role Labeling with Cross-View Training" by Rui Cai and Mirella Lapata. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The abstract mentions the CoNLL-2009 benchmark dataset, which is used for experiments. 

Moving to the introduction, the authors discuss the application of their model on the CoNLL-2009 dataset, specifically for English, Chinese, German, and Spanish. 

In the experiments section, they detail their evaluation on the CoNLL-2009 benchmark, including both in-domain and out-of-domain results. They also mention using unlabeled datasets like the 1 Billion Word Language Model Benchmark for English, the Sougou News Data for Chinese, the NEGRA corpus for German, and the Spanish Language News Corpus for Spanish.

I need to identify each dataset, extract the required metadata, and format it into JSON. 

For each dataset:
1. **dcterms:creator**: Look for authors in the references. For CoNLL-2009, the creators are the CoNLL organizers. For others, like Sougou News, it's the organization.
2. **dcterms:description**: Based on how the paper describes the dataset's use.
3. **dcterms:title**: The name of the dataset.
4. **dcterms:issued**: The year if available.
5. **dcterms:language**: The language(s) of the dataset.
6. **dcterms:identifier**: DOI or URL if available.
7. **dcat:theme**: Categories like NLP, benchmark.
8. **dcat:keyword**: Tags like semantic role labeling, benchmark.
9. **dcat:landingPage**: URL if available.
10. **dcterms:hasVersion**: Version if mentioned.
11. **dcterms:format**: Text, etc.
12. **mls:task**: Tasks like semantic role labeling.

I'll go through each dataset mentioned and fill in the metadata accordingly.
