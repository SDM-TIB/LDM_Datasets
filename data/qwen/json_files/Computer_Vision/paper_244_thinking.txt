Alright, I'm looking at the provided research paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper is about unsupervised visual representation learning using contrastive predictive coding. 

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction. The abstract mentions ImageNet as a dataset that's been overfitted by complex models. That's one dataset.

In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges with large-scale annotation data and mention ImageNet again, noting that it's being overfitted. They also talk about strategies like data augmentation and semi-supervised learning, but don't mention other datasets.

Moving to the related work section, they discuss contrastive predictive coding and its applications in NLP with models like BERT. They also mention the use of transformer models and neural transfer for data augmentation. However, no new datasets are introduced here.

In the methods section, they describe their approach using image patches and contrastive learning. They reference the use of images but don't specify any particular dataset beyond ImageNet.

The experiments section mentions experiments from ImageNet to ImageNet and Webvision to Webvision, but these are likely referring to the same datasets used in the introduction.

So, the only dataset explicitly mentioned is ImageNet. I'll extract the metadata for ImageNet based on the information provided in the paper.
