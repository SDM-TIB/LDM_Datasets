Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about music theme recognition using CNN and self-attention. Let me go through it step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract to get an overview. It mentions the MTG-Jamendo dataset, specifically the autotagging-moodtheme subset. That's one dataset.

Moving to the introduction, the authors talk about the MediaEval 2019 challenge, which uses the MTG-Jamendo dataset. So, that's the same dataset as mentioned in the abstract.

Looking at the related work section, they reference other studies but don't mention any new datasets. They talk about methods like CNN and self-attention but no datasets beyond MTG-Jamendo.

In the approach section, they again mention using the Mel-spectrograms from the MTG-Jamendo dataset. No new datasets here.

The training and results section also refers to the same dataset, discussing their submissions and performance metrics on it.

Other approaches section mentions using OpenL3 embeddings and Essentia features, but these are methods, not datasets. They also mention raw audio representations but don't specify another dataset.

In the references, the MTG-Jamendo dataset is cited in reference [4], which provides more details about the dataset.

So, the only dataset mentioned in the paper is the MTG-Jamendo dataset, specifically the autotagging-moodtheme subset. I'll need to extract its metadata based on the information provided in the paper and the reference.
