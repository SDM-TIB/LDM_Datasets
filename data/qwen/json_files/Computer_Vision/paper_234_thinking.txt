Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about word embeddings for the Russian language, specifically looking at different models and their components. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions models like RusVectA orA es, fastText, and RDT. These are likely datasets or models used in the study.

Looking at the introduction, the authors discuss word embeddings and mention count-based and predict-based models. They reference RusVectA orA es, fastText, and RDT as examples of these models. 

In the Related Work section, they talk about other studies and models, but I don't see any new datasets mentioned here. 

Moving to the Experiments section, they detail their methodology and the models they used. They specifically mention RusVectA orA es, RDT, and fastText as the models they analyzed. 

The references section lists various papers, but I'm focusing on the datasets mentioned in the main text. 

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. RusVectA orA es
2. RDT (Russian Distributional Thesaurus)
3. fastText

Each of these is a word embedding model for Russian. I'll need to extract metadata for each, including creators, descriptions, titles, etc., based on how they're described in the paper.
