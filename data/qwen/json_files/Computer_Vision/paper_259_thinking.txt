Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses knowledge-grounded dialogue and mentions two datasets: Wizard of Wikipedia and Holl-E. 

Next, I'll check the sections where these datasets are described. The Wizard of Wikipedia dataset is described as a large-scale benchmark for open-domain multi-turn knowledge-based dialogue. It contains dialogues where one speaker (the Wizard) uses Wikipedia articles to provide knowledgeable responses. The Holl-E dataset is another knowledge-based dialogue dataset, though it's smaller and provides spans in documents for grounding responses.

I'll also look for any references or citations to these datasets. The Wizard of Wikipedia is cited as Dinan et al., 2019, and Holl-E is cited as Moghe et al., 2018. 

Now, I'll gather the metadata for each dataset. For the Wizard of Wikipedia, the creators are Dinan, Roller, Shuster, Fan, Auli, and Weston. It's a text dataset used for dialogue tasks, published in 2019. The landing page is provided. For Holl-E, the creators are Moghe, Arora, Banerjee, and Khapra, published in 2018, also a text dataset for dialogue tasks.

I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset includes all the specified metadata fields.
