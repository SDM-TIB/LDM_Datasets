Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses asynchronous pipeline parallelism for training deep neural networks, mentioning datasets like CIFAR10, ImageNet, IWSLT14, and WMT17. These are standard datasets used for image classification and neural machine translation tasks.

Next, I'll look into the sections where experiments are described. In Section 4, the authors evaluate their method, PipeMare, on ResNet50 and Transformer models using CIFAR10, ImageNet, IWSLT14, and WMT17 datasets. They also mention using the cpusmall dataset in Appendix B.1 for a simple linear regression problem.

Now, I'll gather information about each dataset:

1. **CIFAR10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, commonly used for image classification. It's cited in the paper's references as [1].

2. **ImageNet**: A large dataset containing over 14 million images across 1000 classes. It's used for image classification tasks and is cited as [1].

3. **IWSLT14**: A dataset for machine translation, specifically German to English. It's mentioned in the context of evaluating the Transformer model.

4. **WMT17**: Another machine translation dataset, English to German. It's used to evaluate the effectiveness of PipeMare.

5. **cpusmall**: A synthetic dataset used for a simple linear regression problem in the paper's experiments.

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata:

- **Creators**: Look for authors in the references. For CIFAR10 and ImageNet, the authors are mentioned in the references. For IWSLT14 and WMT17, the creators are not explicitly mentioned in the paper, so I'll leave it as an empty list. cpusmall is a synthetic dataset, so no creator is assigned.

- **Description**: Based on how the paper uses or describes each dataset.

- **Title**: The name of the dataset.

- **Issued**: The year the dataset was published, if available.

- **Language**: Applicable only for text datasets.

- **Identifier**: DOI or URL if available.

- **Theme**: Thematic categories based on the dataset's content.

- **Keyword**: Tags describing the dataset.

- **Landing Page**: URL or DOI if available.

- **Has Version**: Specific version if mentioned.

- **Format**: Data format, e.g., image, text.

- **Task**: The tasks the dataset is used for in the paper.

After compiling this information, I'll structure each dataset into the specified JSON format.
