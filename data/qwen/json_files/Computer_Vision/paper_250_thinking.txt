Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper is about face recovery from portraits, so I'm looking for datasets related to faces, portraits, or style transfer.

In the introduction, the authors mention using the CelebA dataset. CelebA is a well-known dataset of celebrity faces. They used it to generate their training and testing datasets by applying style transfer techniques. So, CelebA is one dataset.

Next, in the section about the synthesized dataset, the authors mention using the CUFSF dataset. CUFSF stands for CU Face Sketches and Faces, which is a dataset containing face sketches and their corresponding photos. They used this for testing their method on hand-drawn sketches.

They also reference the FERET dataset, which is another face dataset, often used for face recognition and sketch-to-face tasks. The authors used FERET's sketches for testing.

Looking through the references, I don't find any other datasets mentioned. The authors didn't reference any other datasets beyond CelebA, CUFSF, and FERET.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the metadata fields:

1. **CelebA**:
   - Creator: The authors of CelebA, which are not explicitly mentioned in the paper, so I'll leave it as an empty list.
   - Description: A dataset of celebrity faces used for generating training and testing pairs.
   - Title: CelebA.
   - Issued: The year CelebA was published, which is 2015.
   - Language: Not applicable as it's image data.
   - Identifier: The URL where CelebA can be found.
   - Theme: Computer Vision, Face Recognition.
   - Keywords: Face dataset, celebrity faces.
   - Landing Page: The URL to the CelebA dataset.
   - Format: Image.
   - Task: Face recovery, style transfer.

2. **CUFSF**:
   - Creator: Not mentioned in the paper.
   - Description: A dataset containing face sketches and photos used for testing.
   - Title: CUFSF.
   - Issued: The year CUFSF was published, which is 2009.
   - Language: Not applicable.
   - Identifier: The URL to CUFSF.
   - Theme: Computer Vision, Face Recognition.
   - Keywords: Face sketches, face photos.
   - Landing Page: The URL to CUFSF.
   - Format: Image.
   - Task: Face recovery, sketch-to-face.

3. **FERET**:
   - Creator: Not mentioned in the paper.
   - Description: A dataset used for face recognition and sketch-to-face tasks.
   - Title: FERET.
   - Issued: The year FERET was published, which is 1997.
   - Language: Not applicable.
   - Identifier: The URL to FERET.
   - Theme: Computer Vision, Face Recognition.
   - Keywords: Face dataset, face recognition.
   - Landing Page: The URL to FERET.
   - Format: Image.
   - Task: Face recovery, sketch-to-face.

I need to ensure that each field is correctly filled based on the information available in the paper. If a field isn't mentioned, I'll leave it as an empty string or list as appropriate.
