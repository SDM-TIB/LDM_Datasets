Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll go through the abstract. It mentions CIFAR-10, which is a well-known dataset for image classification. So, CIFAR-10 is definitely one dataset to include.

Moving on to the introduction, the paper discusses various applications of deep neural networks, including image generation. It specifically mentions CIFAR-10 again, so that's consistent. Additionally, it references the WMT English-German translation task, which is a dataset used in machine translation. So, WMT English-German is another dataset to include.

In the sections discussing experiments and results, the paper mentions the SVHN dataset, which is used for digit recognition. This is another dataset to include. The paper also refers to the WMT English-French dataset, which is another translation task dataset. So, WMT English-French is the fourth dataset.

Now, I'll go through each dataset one by one to extract the required metadata.

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   - **Creator**: The dataset was created by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton.
   - **Description**: It's a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images divided into 10 classes, commonly used for image classification tasks.
   - **Title**: CIFAR-10
   - **Issued**: The dataset was introduced in 2009.
   - **Language**: Not applicable as it's an image dataset.
   - **Identifier**: The official website URL is http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.
   - **Theme**: Computer Vision, Image Classification.
   - **Keywords**: Image classification, benchmark dataset.
   - **Landing Page**: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.
   - **Version**: Not specified.
   - **Format**: Image.
   - **Task**: Image classification.

2. **WMT English-German**:
   - **Creator**: The dataset is part of the WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation) series, created by various contributors.
   - **Description**: It's a dataset for machine translation tasks, containing parallel text data between English and German.
   - **Title**: WMT English-German
   - **Issued**: The specific year isn't mentioned, but WMT datasets are typically updated annually.
   - **Language**: English, German.
   - **Identifier**: No specific DOI or URL provided in the paper.
   - **Theme**: Natural Language Processing, Machine Translation.
   - **Keywords**: Machine translation, parallel corpus.
   - **Landing Page**: Not provided.
   - **Version**: Not specified.
   - **Format**: Text.
   - **Task**: Machine translation.

3. **SVHN**:
   - **Creator**: The dataset was created by Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng.
   - **Description**: It's a dataset of real-world house numbers collected from Google Street View imagery, containing over 600,000 digit images.
   - **Title**: SVHN
   - **Issued**: The dataset was introduced in 2011.
   - **Language**: Not applicable as it's an image dataset.
   - **Identifier**: The official website URL is http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/.
   - **Theme**: Computer Vision, Digit Recognition.
   - **Keywords**: Digit recognition, real-world images.
   - **Landing Page**: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/.
   - **Version**: Not specified.
   - **Format**: Image.
   - **Task**: Digit recognition.

4. **WMT English-French**:
   - **Creator**: Similar to the English-German dataset, it's part of the WMT series.
   - **Description**: Contains parallel text data between English and French for machine translation tasks.
   - **Title**: WMT English-French
   - **Issued**: Year not specified.
   - **Language**: English, French.
   - **Identifier**: No specific DOI or URL provided.
   - **Theme**: Natural Language Processing, Machine Translation.
   - **Keywords**: Machine translation, parallel corpus.
   - **Landing Page**: Not provided.
   - **Version**: Not specified.
   - **Format**: Text.
   - **Task**: Machine translation.

I need to ensure that each dataset is accurately described based on the paper's usage and any available references. For some datasets, like WMT English-German and WMT English-French, the paper doesn't provide specific creators or identifiers, so those fields will remain empty or as placeholders.
