Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Image Patch Matching Using Convolutional Descriptors with Euclidean Distance" by Iaroslav Melekhov, Juho Kannala, and Esa Rahtu. It discusses a neural network-based image descriptor for patch matching, comparing it to existing methods like SIFT and DAISY. The authors mention experiments conducted on the Multi-view Stereo Correspondence (MSC) dataset.

Looking through the paper, the MSC dataset is described as consisting of more than 1.5 million grayscale patches from images of the Statue of Liberty, Notre Dame, and Yosemite. The dataset includes pairs of matching and non-matching patches, which were used for training and evaluation of the proposed descriptor.

I need to extract metadata for the MSC dataset. The creators are mentioned in the paper's references as [3], which corresponds to Hua, G., Brown, M., and Winder, S. The description is based on how the authors used the dataset. The title is "Multi-view Stereo Correspondence (MSC) dataset." The issued year is 2010, as per the reference. The format is image patches, and the tasks include image patch matching and feature extraction.

I should structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring all fields are filled appropriately based on the paper's description.
