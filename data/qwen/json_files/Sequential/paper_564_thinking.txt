Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about the ELMoLex system, which combines ELMo features and lexicon features for dependency parsing. 

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions the CoNLL 2018 Shared Task on parsing from raw text to Universal Dependencies. That's one dataset.

Looking further into the introduction, the authors reference the BiAF parser by Dozat and Manning (2016) and their follow-up work (Dozat et al., 2017). These references might point to datasets used in their experiments, but I need to check the references section for more details.

In the methods section, the authors discuss using ELMo features from Peters et al. (2018) and lexicon features from Sagot (2018). These are additional datasets.

The results section mentions the CoNLL 2018 Shared Task again, confirming its use. They also reference the UDPipe tokenizer by Straka et al. (2016), which is another dataset.

I should also check the references section for any other datasets. The references include works by Peters et al., Sagot, Straka et al., and others, but I'm focusing on datasets used in the paper.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. CoNLL 2018 Shared Task
2. ELMo features from Peters et al. (2018)
3. Lexicon features from Sagot (2018)
4. UDPipe tokenizer from Straka et al. (2016)

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields based on the information provided in the paper.
