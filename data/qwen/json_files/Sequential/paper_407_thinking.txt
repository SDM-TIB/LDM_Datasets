Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses AdaBERT, a method for compressing BERT models using differentiable neural architecture search. It mentions evaluating the method on several NLP tasks and datasets.

In the methodology section, the authors describe their approach but don't mention specific datasets. The experiments section is where datasets are likely mentioned. Scanning through, I find that the authors evaluate their method on six datasets from the GLUE benchmark. These datasets include SST-2, MRPC, QQP, MNLI, QNLI, and RTE.

I need to gather metadata for each of these datasets. Let's go through each one:

1. **SST-2**: This is the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset. It's used for sentiment classification, distinguishing between positive and negative sentiments. The creators are Richard Socher, Alex Perely, and Chris Manning. The dataset was published in 2013. It's in English and is used for sentiment analysis tasks.

2. **MRPC**: Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus. It's used for paraphrase detection, identifying whether two sentences are paraphrases. The creators are Bing Liu, Xiaoyan Zhu, and Jianyong Wang. Published in 2011, it's in English and used for semantic equivalence tasks.

3. **QQP**: Quora Question Pairs dataset. It's used to determine if two questions are semantically equivalent. The creators are the Quora team, and it's from 2017. It's in English and used for semantic equivalence tasks.

4. **MNLI**: Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference dataset. It's used for textual entailment, determining if a hypothesis is true given a premise. The creators are the Stanford team, and it was published in 2018. It's in English and used for entailment recognition.

5. **QNLI**: Question NLI dataset. It's used to determine if a question is entailed by a given passage. The creators are the Stanford team, and it's from 2018. It's in English and used for entailment recognition.

6. **RTE**: Recognizing Textual Entailment dataset. It's used to determine if a text entails another. The creators are the RTE challenge organizers, and it's from 2005. It's in English and used for entailment recognition.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the metadata vocabulary:

- **dcterms:creator**: The authors or creators of the dataset.
- **dcterms:description**: A brief description of the dataset based on its use in the paper.
- **dcterms:title**: The name of the dataset.
- **dcterms:issued**: The year the dataset was published.
- **dcterms:language**: The language of the dataset content.
- **dcterms:identifier**: DOI or URL if available (not provided in the paper).
- **dcat:theme**: Thematic categories, such as sentiment analysis, paraphrase detection, etc.
- **dcat:keyword**: Keywords related to the dataset.
- **dcat:landingPage**: URL if available (not provided).
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Specific version if mentioned (not mentioned).
- **dcterms:format**: Format of the dataset, typically text.
- **mls:task**: Tasks for which the dataset is used, such as sentiment classification, paraphrase detection, etc.

I'll ensure each dataset is accurately described based on the information extracted from the paper.
