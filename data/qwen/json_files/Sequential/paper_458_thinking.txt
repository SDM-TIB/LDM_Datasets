Alright, I'm trying to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about detecting sarcasm and irony using deep contextualized word representations. 

First, I'll go through the paper section by section to identify any datasets. The abstract mentions testing the model on 7 different datasets from 3 sources. That's a good start. 

Looking at the introduction, I don't see any specific datasets mentioned, just general discussions about sarcasm and irony detection. 

In the Related Work section, there's a mention of the SemEval 2018 Task 3 on Irony Detection in English Tweets. That's one dataset. Also, Riloff et al. (2013) is cited for a sarcasm dataset. Another dataset from PtA aEcek et al. (2014) is mentioned, which uses the #sarcasm hashtag. 

Moving to the Experimental Setup section, the authors describe several datasets in detail. They mention the Twitter dataset from SemEval 2018, Riloff's dataset, PtA aEcek's dataset, and the SARC corpus from Khodak et al. (2017), which includes SARC 2.0 and its political subset. They also reference the Sarcasm Corpus V1 and V2 (SC-V1 and SC-V2) from Oraby et al. (2016). 

In the Results section, they discuss performance on these datasets but don't introduce any new ones. 

So, compiling all the datasets mentioned:

1. SemEval-2018 Task 3 (Irony Detection in English Tweets)
2. Riloff et al. (2013) Sarcasm Dataset
3. PtA aEcek et al. (2014) Sarcasm Dataset
4. SARC 2.0 and SARC 2.0 pol from Khodak et al. (2017)
5. Sarcasm Corpus V1 (SC-V1) and V2 (SC-V2) from Oraby et al. (2016)

Now, I'll extract the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
