Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses efficient contextual representation learning without a softmax layer, focusing on ELMo and other models. It mentions datasets used for training and evaluation.

Looking at the sections, I find references to several datasets:

1. **One Billion Word Benchmark**: This is mentioned in the context of training ELMo and other models. It's a large corpus used for language modeling.

2. **Common Crawl**: Used for training FastText embeddings, which are then used in the SEMFIT layer.

3. **SNLI Dataset**: Used for the textual entailment task, specifically for evaluating the model's performance.

4. **CoNLL 2012 Shared Task**: Related to coreference resolution, this dataset is used for evaluation.

5. **SST-5**: A sentiment analysis dataset used for evaluation.

6. **CoNLL 2003 NER Task**: Used for named entity recognition evaluation.

7. **SRL Dataset**: From the CoNLL 2013 shared task, used for semantic role labeling evaluation.

8. **SQuAD**: Mentioned but not available for implementation, so it's noted but not included in the final datasets.

Now, I'll gather the details for each dataset:

- **One Billion Word Benchmark**: Created by Chelba et al. in 2013, used for training language models. It's a large text corpus.

- **Common Crawl**: A massive web crawl dataset, used for training word embeddings.

- **SNLI**: Created by Bowman et al. in 2015, contains pairs of sentences for entailment analysis.

- **CoNLL 2012**: Created by Pradhan et al. in 2012, focuses on coreference resolution.

- **SST-5**: Created by Socher et al. in 2013, involves sentiment analysis with five labels.

- **CoNLL 2003 NER**: Created by Sang and De Meulder in 2003, used for named entity recognition.

- **SRL Dataset**: Created by Pradhan et al. in 2013, focuses on semantic role labeling.

Each dataset's metadata is extracted based on the paper's usage and descriptions. I'll structure each dataset with the required fields, ensuring accuracy and completeness.
