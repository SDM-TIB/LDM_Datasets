Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Argumentative Link Prediction using Residual Networks and Multi-Objective Learning" by Andrea Galassi, Marco Lippi, and Paolo Torroni. The abstract mentions evaluating the model on a challenging dataset consisting of user-generated comments from an online platform. This suggests that the dataset is related to argumentation mining.

Looking through the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges in argument structure prediction and mention that their approach does not rely on domain-specific knowledge. They reference the Cornell eRule-making Corpus (CDCP) in the benchmark section. 

In the benchmark section (Section 4.1), the dataset is explicitly mentioned as the Cornell eRule-making Corpus (CDCP). It consists of 731 user comments from a eRule-making website, with about 4,700 propositions. The dataset is used to evaluate the model's performance in link prediction and argument component classification.

The authors also reference the work of Niculae et al. (2017), which is where the CDCP corpus is originally described. This indicates that the dataset's creators are the authors of that work, specifically Vlad Niculae, Joonsuk Park, and Claire Cardie.

The dataset is described as containing user comments, which are argumentative in nature, and it's used for tasks like link prediction and proposition classification. The language of the dataset is English, as it's based on user comments from an online platform. The format is text, and the themes are argumentation mining and natural language processing.

I need to structure this information into the required JSON format, including all the specified metadata fields. The creators are the authors of the dataset, which are Vlad Niculae, Joonsuk Park, and Claire Cardie. The description is based on how the dataset is used in the paper. The title is "Cornell eRule-making Corpus (CDCP)". The issued year is 2017, as that's when the dataset was first described. The language is English, and the identifier is the DOI from the reference. The themes are argumentation mining and natural language processing. The keywords include argumentative link prediction, user comments, and proposition classification. The landing page is the DOI URL. The format is text, and the tasks include link prediction and proposition classification.
