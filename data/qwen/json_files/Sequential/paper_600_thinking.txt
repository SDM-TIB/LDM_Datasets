Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about customer feedback analysis using machine learning and neural networks. It mentions several datasets and tools used in their experiments.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The abstract mentions that the task involves classifying customer feedback into predefined categories. They used data from Microsoft Office customers in four languages: English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. So, the main dataset here is the customer feedback data provided by Microsoft.

Next, I'll look into the methodology section. They mention using pre-trained embeddings like GloVe and fastText. These are datasets of word embeddings trained on large corpora. GloVe was trained on the Common Crawl corpus, and fastText uses a similar approach but with subword information.

They also reference SVM and other machine learning models, but those aren't datasets. The key datasets are the customer feedback data and the word embeddings they used.

In the corpus details section, they provide statistics about the number of tokens and the distribution of classes. This confirms that the customer feedback dataset is the primary dataset used.

I should also check the references for any additional datasets. The references include works on SVM, LSTM, and word embeddings, but no other datasets are mentioned beyond the ones already identified.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. Customer feedback data from Microsoft Office customers.
2. GloVe embeddings trained on Common Crawl.
3. fastText embeddings.

Each of these should be described with the appropriate metadata fields as per the instructions.
