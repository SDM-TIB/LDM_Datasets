Alright, I'm looking at the provided paper to identify all the datasets mentioned. The paper is about detecting Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) in tweets using ELMo embeddings. 

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction. The paper mentions that they used data from the SMM4H 2019 shared task. The datasets provided include 25,672 tweets for task 1, a validation set of approximately 5,000 unlabeled tweets, and a subset of 2,367 tweets for task 2. The evaluation data has 1,000 tweets. 

Next, in the preprocessing section, they mention using the FDA's Approved Drug Products list. This is a dataset of drug names. 

In the methods section, they reference three lexicon sets: Nikfarjam et al., MedDRA, and CHV. These are datasets used for similarity matching to identify ADR mentions.

I'll extract each of these datasets, gather their metadata as per the vocabulary, and structure them into JSON format.
