Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let's start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses SemEval-2019 Task 9, which involves suggestion mining from online texts. It mentions two subtasks: A and B. 

Looking at Subtask A, the dataset provided includes 8500 examples, with 6415 non-suggestions and 2085 suggestions. It's from an online suggestion forum. The validation set has 592 examples, split equally. The domain is software suggestion forums, which has balanced data and specific vocabulary.

For Subtask B, the dataset is hotel reviews. Only a validation set of 808 examples is provided, with 404 in each class. The authors used an external dataset of nearly 200k hotel reviews without labels for cross-domain classification. This dataset is referenced from Wachsmuth et al., 2014.

Now, I'll check the references section for more details. The hotel review dataset is cited as (Wachsmuth et al., 2014), but the paper doesn't provide a DOI or URL. The other datasets are part of the SemEval-2019 Task 9, which might have its own creators and details, but they aren't explicitly mentioned beyond the task description.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields. For the hotel review dataset, the creators are from Wachsmuth et al., 2014. The description is based on how it's used in the paper. The title is "Hotel Review Dataset." The issued year is 2014. The language is English. The landing page is empty as no URL is provided. The theme is "Text Classification," keywords include "hotel reviews" and "cross-domain classification." The format is text, and the task is "Suggestion Mining."

For the SemEval-2019 Task 9 datasets (Subtask A and B), the creators are the task organizers, but they aren't explicitly listed. The description is based on the paper's usage. The title is "SemEval-2019 Task 9 Dataset." The issued year is 2019. The language is English. The landing page is empty. The theme is "Text Classification," keywords include "suggestion mining" and "cross-domain classification." The format is text, and the task is "Suggestion Mining."

I'll ensure each dataset is listed separately with their respective metadata. Since the creators for SemEval-2019 aren't explicitly mentioned, I'll leave that field empty. The hotel review dataset's creators are inferred from the citation.
