Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let's start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "JU ETCE 17 21 at SemEval-2019 Task 6: Efficient Machine Learning and Neural Network Approaches for Identifying and Categorizing Offensive Language in Tweets" by Mainak Pal, Preeti Mukherjee, Somnath Banerjee, and Sudip Kumar Naskar. It describes their participation in SemEval-2019 Task 6, which is about identifying and categorizing offensive language in tweets.

In the abstract, they mention using the dataset provided by the organizers of OffensEval. The dataset consists of 13,240 tweets annotated for offensive language identification, categorization of offense types, and target identification.

Looking into the methodology section, they describe the dataset in more detail. The training dataset has three main categories for Sub-task A: NOT (Not Offensive), OFF (Offensive). For Sub-task B, it's TIN (Targeted Insult and Threats) and UNT (Untargeted). For Sub-task C, it's IND (Individual), GRP (Group), and OTH (Other).

The paper also references the overview paper by Zampieri et al. (2019b) for more details on the dataset. Additionally, they mention using pre-trained word embeddings like Glove and word2vec, but these are not datasets per se but resources used in their models.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The main dataset used is the one provided by the OffensEval organizers for SemEval-2019 Task 6.

Now, I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring all metadata fields are filled appropriately based on the paper's description.
