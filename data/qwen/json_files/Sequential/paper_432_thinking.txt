Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about video captioning, specifically the Imperial College London submission to the VATEX challenge. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions the VATEX dataset, which is a large collection of videos with English and Chinese captions. That's one dataset.

Next, I'll look into the "2. Dataset" section. Here, the paper details the VATEX dataset, providing specifics like the number of training, validation, and test videos, and the number of captions per video. It also mentions that the video features are extracted using I3D action features from a pre-trained ConvNet. 

I should check if I3D is a dataset or just a model. From what I know, I3D (Inflated 3D ConvNets) is a model used for action recognition, not a dataset. So, the only dataset explicitly mentioned is VATEX.

I'll also scan the rest of the paper to ensure no other datasets are referenced. The methods section talks about models and techniques but doesn't mention any additional datasets. The references include various papers, but none of them are datasets used in this specific study.

So, the only dataset mentioned in the paper is VATEX. I'll extract its metadata based on the information provided.
