Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses question generation from paragraphs using hierarchical models. It mentions experiments conducted on two datasets: SQuAD and MSMARCO.

Next, I'll check the sections where these datasets are described. In the "Experimental Setup" section, under "Datasets," the authors detail their use of SQuAD and MSMARCO. SQuAD is described as containing Wikipedia articles and questions, while MSMARCO includes web passages and questions.

I'll also look for any references or citations related to these datasets. The paper cites SQuAD as Rajpurkar et al., 2016, and MSMARCO as Nguyen et al., 2016. These citations provide the creators of the datasets.

Now, I'll gather the metadata for each dataset. For SQuAD, the creators are Rajpurkar, Zhang, Lopyrev, and Liang. The description is based on how the paper uses it for question generation. The title is "SQuAD," published in 2016, in English, with no specific identifier provided. The theme is NLP, and keywords include question generation and reading comprehension. The landing page is the official SQuAD website.

For MSMARCO, the creators are Nguyen, Rosenberg, Song, Gao, Tiwary, Majumder, and Deng. The description focuses on its use for generating questions from web passages. The title is "MS MARCO," published in 2016, in English, with no identifier. The theme is NLP, and keywords include question generation and web passages. The landing page is the official MSMARCO website.

I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described with the appropriate metadata fields.
