Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses the #MeToo movement and the development of a Disclosure Language Model to classify tweets related to sexual harassment disclosures. It mentions the creation of a new dataset through manual annotation.

Looking into the Data section (Section 3), the authors describe how they collected data from Twitter, Tumblr, and Reddit. They used specific hashtags and keywords to gather tweets. The dataset was manually annotated by clinical psychologists and gender studies experts, resulting in 1126 Disclosure tweets out of 5117 total.

In the references, I don't see any other datasets mentioned beyond the one created by the authors. They don't reference external datasets like Reddit's Domestic Abuse Dataset or others, so the only dataset to extract is their own.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for this dataset. The creators are the authors of the paper. The description includes the collection process and annotation. The title is the dataset's name, which isn't explicitly given but can be inferred as their manually annotated dataset. The issued year is 2019, the language is English, and the landing page is their GitHub repository. The theme is social media analysis, keywords include sexual harassment and disclosure, and the task is text classification.

I'll ensure all fields are filled accurately based on the paper's information.
