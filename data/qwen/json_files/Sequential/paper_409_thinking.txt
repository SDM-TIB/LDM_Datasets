Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses contextualized word embeddings and their application in various tasks. It mentions ELMo, which is a model, but not a dataset. 

Moving on to the related work section, I see references to studies using different models, but no datasets are explicitly mentioned here. 

In the experiment section, the authors describe their setup. They mention using several paraphrase datasets for training and evaluation. Specifically, they refer to MRPC, Sampled Quora, and PAN. 

Looking at the references, I find more details about these datasets:
- MRPC (Dolan et al., 2004) is the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus.
- Sampled Quora is a dataset of paraphrased questions from Quora.
- PAN (Madnani et al., 2012) is the Paraphrase and Paraphrase Identification dataset.

Each of these datasets is used for training and evaluating the model's ability to handle paraphrases. 

I'll now structure each dataset with the required metadata fields based on the information extracted from the paper and its references.
