Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses sentence-level pretraining beyond language modeling, comparing various pretraining tasks. It mentions using the GLUE benchmark and other tasks like language modeling, machine translation, and response prediction.

Looking into the "Tasks" section, I see several datasets listed under GLUE tasks and outside tasks. The GLUE tasks include CoLA, SST, MRPC, QQP, STS, MNLI, QNLI, RTE, and WNLI. Outside tasks include WikiText-103 (WT), Billion Word Language Model Benchmark (BWB), WMT14 English-German, WMT17 English-Russian, SkipThought, DisSent, and Reddit comments.

Each of these datasets is used for pretraining or intermediate training. I'll need to gather details about each dataset, such as their creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, languages, identifiers, themes, keywords, landing pages, versions, formats, and tasks.

For example, WikiText-103 is a language modeling dataset created by Merity et al. in 2017. It's a large corpus of text used for training language models. Similarly, the GLUE benchmark is a collection of tasks curated by Wang et al. in 2019.

I'll structure each dataset entry with the required metadata fields, ensuring accuracy based on the information provided in the paper. If some details aren't explicitly mentioned, I'll leave those fields empty or use placeholders as needed.

Finally, I'll compile all the identified datasets into a JSON format, making sure each entry is correctly formatted and all necessary fields are included.
