Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about predicting implicit emotions in tweets using an ensemble model. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, the abstract mentions the WASSA 2018 shared task on emotion prediction. That's one dataset. The task involves tweets with emotion keywords removed, making it implicit. So, the WASSA 2018 dataset is definitely one.

In the introduction, they talk about the challenge of implicit emotion prediction. They mention the WASSA task again, so that's consistent. They also mention experimenting on the Cornell movie dataset in Section 7. That's another dataset.

Looking at the related work section, they reference Chen et al. (2018) who introduced an emotion corpus from Friends TV scripts. That's another dataset, the Friends corpus.

In the task description, they detail the WASSA 2018 corpus, which has around 188,000 tweets with six emotion labels. They also mention the Cornell movie dataset in Section 7, which is used for generalization testing.

In the experiments section, they mention the Cornell dataset again, which includes 300,000 utterances from movies, annotated with emotions. They also reference the VAD lexicon by Mohammad (2018), which is another dataset.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. WASSA 2018 corpus
2. Cornell movie dataset
3. Friends corpus
4. VAD lexicon

Now, I need to extract metadata for each. For each dataset, I'll look for creators, description, title, year, language, identifier, themes, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For WASSA 2018, the creators are the authors of the paper, but the dataset is from Klinger et al. (2018). Description is about tweets with implicit emotions. Themes include emotion analysis, NLP. Keywords are emotion prediction, tweets.

Cornell movie dataset is from Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lee (2011). It's about movie dialogues with emotions. Themes are sentiment analysis, emotion recognition.

Friends corpus is from Chen et al. (2018), based on TV scripts. Themes are emotion classification, conversation analysis.

VAD lexicon is from Mohammad (2018), providing valence, arousal, dominance scores. Themes are emotion lexicons, affective computing.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields.
