Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses evaluating open-domain dialogue systems using entailment techniques. It mentions using conversational corpora and building a synthetic inference dataset called InferConvAI. 

Moving to the Related Work section, I see references to the Persona-Chat corpus and the MultiNLI corpus. The Persona-Chat dataset is used to form the basis of their inference data, while MultiNLI is mentioned for creating contradictory instances.

In the Methods section, the paper uses the OpenSubtitles and Reddit datasets for training their dialogue models. These datasets are mentioned as sources for generating responses and evaluating coherence.

The Experiments section details the use of Reddit and OpenSubtitles datasets, each with specific splits for training, development, and testing. Additionally, the paper references the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) and ELMo embeddings, which are datasets in themselves for pre-trained models.

I also note that the paper mentions the Stanford NLI corpus and GLUE benchmark, which are standard datasets for evaluating NLI models, though they might not be directly used in this specific study.

Now, I'll list out all the datasets identified:

1. InferConvAI
2. Persona-Chat
3. MultiNLI
4. OpenSubtitles
5. Reddit
6. Universal Sentence Encoder (USE)
7. ELMo
8. Stanford NLI corpus
9. GLUE benchmark

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata fields based on the information provided in the paper. If specific details like creators, publication year, or URLs aren't mentioned, I'll leave those fields empty or mark them as not found.

Finally, I'll structure the information into a JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described according to the metadata vocabulary.
