Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions applying BERT to coreference resolution and achieving improvements on the OntoNotes and GAP benchmarks. So, I note these two datasets: OntoNotes and GAP.

Next, I'll go through the introduction. It references BERT's performance on various tasks, but no new datasets are mentioned here. The methods section discusses the use of c2f-coref and BERT, but again, no new datasets beyond OntoNotes and GAP.

In the experiments section, the paper details evaluations on OntoNotes and GAP. It also mentions that the GAP dataset is derived from Wikipedia snippets. Additionally, the paper references the CoNLL-2012 shared task, which is related to OntoNotes.

Looking at the references, I find more details about OntoNotes and GAP. OntoNotes is cited as being from Pradhan et al., 2012, and GAP from Webster et al., 2018. There's also a mention of the CoNLL-2012 shared task, which is another dataset related to coreference resolution.

I should also check if there are any other datasets mentioned, such as any used for training or evaluation beyond these. However, from the provided text, it seems that the main datasets are OntoNotes and GAP, with CoNLL-2012 being related to OntoNotes.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information gathered. For OntoNotes, the creators are the authors from the reference, the description is about the document-level dataset, and the themes and keywords are related to coreference resolution. Similarly, for GAP, the creators are from the Webster et al. reference, and the description focuses on ambiguous pronoun-name pairs.

I need to ensure that each dataset's metadata is accurately filled, including creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, themes, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks. If any of these fields aren't explicitly mentioned, I'll leave them as empty strings or lists.

Finally, I'll compile all the identified datasets into the required JSON format, making sure to only include the datasets mentioned in the paper and not any other entities or references.
