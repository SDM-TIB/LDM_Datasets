Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify the datasets.

First, the paper is titled "Predicting Sentiment of Polish Language Short Texts" by Aleksander Wawer and Julita Sobiczewska. The abstract mentions using several Polish language datasets for sentiment analysis. 

Looking at Section 2, the authors describe the datasets used:

1. **Polish Sentiment Treebank (TW)**: This is mentioned in 2.1. It has versions 1.0 and 2.0. The description includes that it's a dependency treebank with sentiment annotations, containing sentences from Składnica Treebank and product reviews. It's available for download.

2. **Twitter Data**: Mentioned in 2.2. It contains 1000 Polish tweets manually labeled for sentiment. Due to Twitter's policy, it's not publicly downloadable.

3. **Movie Reviews**: Described in 2.3. This dataset has 1000 manually collected movie reviews from ilmweb.pl, scaled into three sentiment categories. The reviews often have spelling mistakes and slang.

Now, I'll extract the metadata for each dataset based on the provided vocabulary.
