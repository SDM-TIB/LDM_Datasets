Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, the paper is about emotion recognition using neural networks and multi-level preprocessing. The authors mention several embedding layers and datasets used for training these embeddings.

1. **GloVe embeddings**: The paper mentions using GloVe embeddings trained on the Twitter dataset. I need to find details about this dataset. From the references, I see that GloVe is created by Pennington et al. (2014). The Twitter dataset is a subset of GloVe, focusing on social media text.

2. **ELMo embeddings**: ELMo is developed by Peters et al. (2018). The paper uses the pre-trained ELMo model available online. I'll note the creators as Peters et al.

3. **Universal Sentence Encoder (USE)**: The paper refers to USE from Cer et al. (2018). They mention both small and large versions. The creators are Cer et al.

4. **InferSent embeddings**: InferSent is by Conneau et al. (2017). The paper uses this model but faces integration issues. The creators are Conneau et al.

5. **WASSA-2018 dataset**: This is the main dataset used for the emotion recognition task. It's organized by Klinger et al. (2018). The dataset contains tweets with removed emotion words, categorized into six emotions.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring creators are correctly identified and descriptions are based on the paper's usage.
