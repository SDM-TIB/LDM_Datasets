Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, the paper's title is "Language Modeling Teaches You More Syntax than Translation Does: Lessons Learned Through Auxiliary Task Analysis." The authors are Kelly W. Zhang and Samuel R. Bowman from New York University.

Looking through the introduction, they mention that they're comparing different pretraining objectives like language modeling, translation, skip-thought, and autoencoding. They're using these tasks to see how they affect the syntactic and part-of-speech information learned by models.

In the methodology section, they mention using datasets from WMT 2016. Specifically, they use the En-De corpus from WMT 2016 for training. They also augment this with a large monolingual corpus from WMT. Additionally, they evaluate their models on the Penn Treebank WSJ corpus for POS tagging and the CCG Bank for supertagging.

So, the datasets mentioned are:

1. WMT 2016 En-De corpus
2. WMT monolingual corpus
3. Penn Treebank WSJ
4. CCG Bank

Now, I need to extract metadata for each of these datasets.

For WMT 2016 En-De corpus:
- Creator: The authors of WMT 2016, which is a conference, so the creators are the contributors, but since the paper doesn't list specific authors, I'll leave it as an empty list.
- Description: It's a parallel corpus of English and German sentences used for machine translation.
- Title: WMT 2016 En-De corpus
- Issued: 2016
- Language: English and German
- Identifier: No specific DOI or URL mentioned in the paper.
- Theme: Machine Translation, Corpus Linguistics
- Keywords: Parallel corpus, Machine translation, English-German
- Landing Page: No URL provided.
- Version: Not specified.
- Format: Text
- Task: Machine Translation, Pretraining

For WMT monolingual corpus:
- Similar to the above but monolingual. The description would be a large monolingual corpus used for training language models.
- Language: English
- Tasks: Language Modeling, Pretraining

Penn Treebank WSJ:
- Creator: Marcus et al., 1993
- Description: A corpus of Wall Street Journal texts annotated with POS tags.
- Title: Penn Treebank WSJ
- Issued: 1993
- Language: English
- Theme: Corpus Linguistics, POS Tagging
- Keywords: POS tagging, Wall Street Journal
- Tasks: POS Tagging, Evaluation

CCG Bank:
- Creator: Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007
- Description: A corpus annotated with CCG supertags.
- Title: CCG Bank
- Issued: 2007
- Language: English
- Theme: Corpus Linguistics, Syntax
- Keywords: CCG supertagging, Syntax
- Tasks: Supertagging, Evaluation

I need to structure this information into JSON format as per the metadata vocabulary provided.
