Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about deep learning for Hindi text classification, comparing different models. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets are used. The abstract mentions using translated versions of English datasets, but doesn't specify which ones. 

Moving to the methods section, under "Datasets," I see three datasets mentioned: TREC, SST-1, and SST-2. 

- **TREC**: It's described as a question classification dataset with 5452 training samples and 500 testing samples. It's translated into Hindi using Google Translate. 
- **SST-1**: This is a sentiment analysis dataset with movie reviews rated from 1 to 5. It has 8544 training samples, 2210 testing, and 1101 validation samples. Also translated into Hindi.
- **SST-2**: A binary version of SST-1, with positive and negative labels. It has 6920 training, 1821 testing, and 872 validation samples. Translated similarly.

I need to extract metadata for each dataset. The creators are the authors of the paper, but since the datasets are mentioned as being used, not created by them, I should look for the original creators. However, the paper doesn't provide references for these datasets, so I can't find the creators. 

The description should be based on how the paper uses them. The language is Hindi since they're translated versions. The format is text. The tasks are text classification, specifically sentiment analysis and question classification.

I'll structure each dataset with the given metadata fields, filling in what's available and leaving others empty if not specified.
