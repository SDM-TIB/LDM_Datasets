Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Transformer-based Model for Single Documents Neural Summarization" by Elozino Egonmwan and Yllias Chali. The abstract mentions the use of the CNN/DailyMail and Newsroom datasets. 

Looking further into the introduction, the authors discuss the CNN/DailyMail dataset as a common benchmark for summarization tasks. They also mention the Newsroom dataset, which was recently released.

In the experiments section, the authors evaluate their models on both the CNN/DailyMail and Newsroom datasets. They provide details about the datasets, such as the number of articles and summaries, and mention that the Newsroom dataset contains metadata like titles and compression ratios.

I should also check the references section for more details on these datasets. The CNN/DailyMail dataset is cited as Hermann et al., 2015, and Nallapati et al., 2016. The Newsroom dataset is cited as Grusky et al., 2018.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.

For the CNN/DailyMail dataset:
- Creators: Hermann, Kocisky, Grefenstette, Espeholt, Kay, Suleyman, and Blunsom.
- Description: A dataset containing news articles and their corresponding summaries, used for evaluating summarization models.
- Title: CNN/DailyMail
- Issued: 2015
- Language: English
- Identifier: DOI 10.1186/gb-2015-9-s2-s2 (though this is a placeholder, as the actual DOI might differ)
- Theme: Text Summarization, News
- Keywords: News articles, Summaries, Extractive summarization, Abstractive summarization
- Landing Page: URL to the dataset (if available)
- Version: Not mentioned
- Format: Text
- Task: Text Summarization

For the Newsroom dataset:
- Creators: Grusky, Naaman, and Artzi.
- Description: A large dataset of news articles with summaries, designed for evaluating abstractive summarization models.
- Title: Newsroom
- Issued: 2018
- Language: English
- Identifier: DOI 10.18653/v1/N18-1119 (placeholder)
- Theme: Text Summarization, News
- Keywords: News articles, Summaries, Abstractive summarization
- Landing Page: URL to the dataset (if available)
- Version: Not mentioned
- Format: Text
- Task: Text Summarization

I need to ensure that the creators are correctly identified from the references. For CNN/DailyMail, the authors are Hermann et al., and for Newsroom, it's Grusky et al.

I should also note that the landing pages and identifiers are placeholders since the actual URLs and DOIs might not be provided in the paper. If they are available, they should be included; otherwise, they remain empty.

Finally, I'll compile this information into the required JSON format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with the appropriate metadata fields.
