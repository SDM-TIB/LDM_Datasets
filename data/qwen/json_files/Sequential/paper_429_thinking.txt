Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction sections. The abstract mentions "WIKITABLEQUESTIONS" and "WIKISQL" datasets. These are likely the main datasets used in the study.

Next, I'll check the methods and experiments sections for more details. In the "Experiments" section, the paper provides more information about these datasets. WIKITABLEQUESTIONS contains 18,496 utterance-denotation pairs, and WIKISQL has 80,654 pairs. Both datasets involve mapping natural language questions to executable programs or SQL queries.

I'll also look for any references or citations related to these datasets. The paper cites Pasupat and Liang (2015) for WIKITABLEQUESTIONS and Zhong et al. (2017) for WIKISQL. These citations provide the creators and publication years of the datasets.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information gathered. For each dataset, I'll include the creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, themes, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

Since the datasets are used for semantic parsing and question answering, the tasks will include "Semantic Parsing" and "Question Answering." The themes are "Natural Language Processing" and "Question Answering."

I'll ensure that the JSON format is correct, with each dataset as an object within an array. I'll avoid including any unnecessary information and stick strictly to the metadata fields specified.

Finally, I'll review the extracted information to make sure all details are accurate and complete before finalizing the JSON response.
