Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Literary Event Detection" and is authored by Matthew Sims, Jong Ho Park, and David Bamman. The main focus of the paper is on developing a new dataset for literary event annotations and comparing various models for event detection.

First, I'll go through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a new dataset of literary events, which is the primary dataset discussed. The authors also reference other datasets in the context of their work, such as ACE 2005, Light ERE, and TimeML, but these are more about event annotation standards rather than datasets per se.

In the introduction, the authors discuss previous work in event detection, mentioning datasets like ACE 2005 and Light ERE. However, these are more about the frameworks used for annotation rather than datasets in the traditional sense.

Looking at the "Data" section, the authors describe their corpus, which consists of approximately the first 2000 words of 100 literary works from Project Gutenberg. This is their primary dataset, which they refer to as their corpus. They mention that this dataset is freely available under a Creative Commons license as part of LitBank.

In the "Event annotations" section, they reference ACE 2005 and Light ERE guidelines but don't mention specific datasets beyond their own corpus.

In the "Analysis" section, they use data from Underwood (2019) to categorize authors into high and low prestige and popularity. However, this data isn't a dataset in the traditional sense but rather a categorization based on reviews and bestseller lists.

In the "Conclusion," they reiterate that their dataset is freely available as part of LitBank.

So, the main dataset mentioned is their own corpus of literary works, which they've annotated for events. They don't reference other datasets beyond their own and the frameworks they used for annotation guidelines.

Now, I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring that each metadata field is appropriately filled based on the information provided in the paper.
