Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Fermi at SemEval-2019 Task 6: Identifying and Categorizing Offensive Language in Social Media using Sentence Embeddings." It describes a system called Fermi that participated in SemEval-2019 Task 6, which involves identifying and categorizing offensive language in social media.

Looking through the sections, I find that the dataset used is referred to as the "OffensEval dataset." This dataset is mentioned in the abstract and the methodology section. The authors reference it in their results and analysis, indicating that it's the primary dataset used for their experiments.

In the references section, the dataset is cited as "Zampieri et al., 2019." This suggests that the creators of the dataset are the authors listed in that reference. The dataset is described as containing 14,100 posts, divided into three sub-tasks: Offensive Language Detection, Categorization, and Target Identification.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The focus is solely on the OffensEval dataset for their experiments and evaluations.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for the OffensEval dataset based on the information extracted.
