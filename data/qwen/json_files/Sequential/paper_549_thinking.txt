Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about contextual emotion detection using transfer learning methods. Let me go through it step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract to get an overview. It mentions SemEval-2019 Task 3, which is about detecting emotions in conversational text. The authors used pre-trained models like ULMFiT, OpenAI GPT, and BERT. They also mention using a dataset provided by the organizers, which includes training, development, and test sets.

Looking at the introduction, they reference previous SemEval tasks, specifically Task 1 from 2018 and Task 4 from 2016, which were about sentiment analysis on tweets. These tasks likely used datasets from Twitter, but the current paper's focus is on SemEval-2019 Task 3.

In the task overview section, the authors detail the dataset provided by the organizers. It's a conversational text dataset with three turns per conversation, labeled with emotions like Happy, Sad, Angry, or Others. The dataset is split into train, dev, and test sets with specific distributions.

The system description section talks about various pre-trained models but doesn't mention any additional datasets beyond what's provided by SemEval-2019 Task 3. They used tools like ekphrasis for preprocessing but didn't reference other datasets.

In the results and analysis, they discuss their model's performance on the provided dataset but don't introduce any new datasets. The conclusion also focuses on their approach and future work without mentioning other datasets.

Looking through the references, I see citations for other SemEval tasks and models, but no additional datasets are mentioned beyond the one used in this paper.

So, the only dataset explicitly mentioned and used in this paper is the one from SemEval-2019 Task 3. It's provided by the organizers and used for training, development, and testing their models. There are no other datasets referenced in the paper.
