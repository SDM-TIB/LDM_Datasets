Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses multilingual probing of deep pre-trained contextual encoders, evaluating them on various linguistic tasks across multiple languages. It mentions using probing tasks and datasets for 6 non-English languages.

In Section 3, the authors describe their corpora and tasks. They mention using Wikipedia dumps for each language, processed using WikiExtractor. They also refer to the Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks for dependency parsing. Additionally, they use the XNLI dataset for cross-lingual evaluation.

Looking at the references, I find citations for these datasets. For example, the Universal Dependencies treebanks are cited as Zeman et al. (2018), and XNLI is cited as Conneau et al. (2018b).

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields:

1. **Wikipedia Dumps**: Used for extracting sentences in multiple languages. The creators are the Wikimedia Foundation, and the dataset is published annually. The language varies by dump, and it's in text format.

2. **Universal Dependencies Treebanks**: These are collections of treebanks for various languages, used for dependency parsing. The creators include multiple researchers, and the dataset is published in 2015. It's in text format and covers multiple languages.

3. **XNLI Dataset**: A multilingual dataset for evaluating sentence representations. Created by Conneau et al. in 2018, it's used for cross-lingual tasks and is in text format.

I'll ensure each dataset is described accurately, including creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, languages, formats, and themes. I'll avoid including any datasets not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
