Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Deep Learning Techniques for Humor Detection in Hindi-English Code-Mixed Tweets" by Sushmitha Reddy Sane and others. The abstract mentions using Twitter data to create bilingual word embeddings and evaluating their models on a benchmark dataset.

Looking into the introduction, the authors discuss the lack of data in code-mixed corpora and mention using Twitter data for their embeddings. They also reference a benchmark dataset from Khandelwal et al. (2018) for evaluation.

In the Corpus creation section (1.1), they mention extracting around 200k tweets using the Twitter API. This dataset is used for training bilingual word embeddings.

In the Results section (2), they mention using a benchmark dataset containing 3543 annotated tweets, which is the same dataset from Khandelwal et al. (2018). This dataset is used to evaluate their models.

I need to check the references to find more details about these datasets. The reference for Khandelwal et al. (2018) is provided, but it's a preprint on arXiv, so I can't extract a DOI or URL from it. The Twitter dataset is mentioned as being created by the authors using the Twitter API, so it's not a publicly available dataset with a specific identifier.

Now, I'll structure the datasets based on the metadata vocabulary:

1. **Twitter Dataset**:
   - Created by the authors using the Twitter API.
   - Description: 200k tweets used for training bilingual word embeddings.
   - Language: Hindi-English code-mixed.
   - Format: Text.
   - Theme: Natural Language Processing, Code-Mixed Data.
   - Keywords: Twitter data, bilingual embeddings, code-mixing.

2. **Khandelwal et al. (2018) Dataset**:
   - Created by Khandelwal et al.
   - Description: 3543 annotated tweets for humor detection.
   - Language: Hindi-English code-mixed.
   - Format: Text.
   - Theme: Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis.
   - Keywords: Humor detection, code-mixed data, benchmark.

I'll format these into JSON as per the required structure.
