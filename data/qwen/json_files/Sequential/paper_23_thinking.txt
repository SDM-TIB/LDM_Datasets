Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses grammatical error detection (GED) using contextual word representations. It mentions several datasets used for evaluation.

Looking at the "3 Data" section, the datasets are explicitly listed:

1. **First Certificate in English (FCE) dataset**: Annotated essays by non-native learners.
2. **CoNLL 2014 shared task dataset**: Essays by advanced undergraduates at the National University of Singapore.
3. **JFLEG dataset**: Essays by English learners of varying proficiency levels.
4. **BEA 2019 shared task datasets**: Includes the Cambridge English Write & Improve (W&I) corpus and the LOCNESS corpus.

I'll need to gather details for each dataset, such as creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, themes, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For each dataset, I'll check the references section to find the creators and publication years. The descriptions are based on how the paper uses or describes them. Themes and keywords are derived from the context in which the datasets are used. Tasks are based on the paper's focus on GED.

Now, I'll structure each dataset into the required JSON format, ensuring all fields are filled appropriately based on the information extracted from the paper.
