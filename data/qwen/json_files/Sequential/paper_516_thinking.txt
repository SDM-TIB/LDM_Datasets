Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let's start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, the paper's title is "Natural Language Generation for Effective Knowledge Distillation" by Raphael Tang, Yao Lu, and Jimmy Lin. The abstract mentions using knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from BERT to traditional neural networks, improving performance on several datasets. 

Looking through the introduction, the authors reference their previous work (Tang et al., 2019) which involved knowledge distillation. They mention datasets in sentiment classification, sentence similarity, and linguistic acceptability. 

In the "Experimental Setup" section (section 4), the authors detail the datasets they used:
1. Stanford Sentiment Treebank-2 (SST-2)
2. Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA)
3. Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B)
4. Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC)

Each of these datasets is part of the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark. 

Now, I'll gather metadata for each dataset:

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank-2 (SST-2)**:
   - Creator: Socher et al., 2013
   - Description: A binary polarity dataset of single-sentence movie reviews.
   - Title: SST-2
   - Issued: 2013
   - Language: English
   - Theme: Sentiment Analysis
   - Keywords: Sentiment, Movie Reviews, Binary Classification
   - Task: Sentiment Classification

2. **Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA)**:
   - Creator: Warstadt et al., 2018
   - Description: A single-sentence grammaticality task with expert annotations.
   - Title: CoLA
   - Issued: 2018
   - Language: English
   - Theme: Grammaticality
   - Keywords: Grammaticality, Linguistic Acceptability
   - Task: Grammaticality Judgment

3. **Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B)**:
   - Creator: Cer et al., 2017
   - Description: Sentence pairs labeled with real-valued similarity scores.
   - Title: STS-B
   - Issued: 2017
   - Language: English
   - Theme: Textual Similarity
   - Keywords: Text Similarity, Sentence Pairs
   - Task: Sentence Similarity

4. **Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC)**:
   - Creator: Dolan and Brockett, 2005
   - Description: Sentence pairs with binary labels indicating semantic equivalence.
   - Title: MRPC
   - Issued: 2005
   - Language: English
   - Theme: Paraphrasing
   - Keywords: Paraphrase, Semantic Equivalence
   - Task: Paraphrase Identification

I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described with the appropriate metadata fields.
