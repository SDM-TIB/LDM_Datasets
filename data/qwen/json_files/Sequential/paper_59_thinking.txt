Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let's start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses word-level textual adversarial attacks using a combinatorial optimization approach. It mentions experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets: IMDB, SST-2, and SNLI.

Next, I'll check the sections where these datasets are described. The IMDB dataset is a well-known benchmark for sentiment analysis, containing movie reviews. SST-2 is another sentiment analysis dataset, smaller but more challenging. SNLI is used for natural language inference, containing premise-hypothesis pairs labeled with entailment, contradiction, or neutral.

I'll also look for any references to other datasets, but from the provided text, only these three are mentioned. Now, I'll gather the necessary metadata for each dataset.

For each dataset, I'll extract the creator(s), description, title, publication year, language, identifier (like DOI or URL), themes, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks. Since the paper doesn't provide specific DOIs or URLs for these datasets, I'll leave those fields empty. The creators are the authors of the datasets as cited in the paper.

Finally, I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described based on the paper's usage and description.
