Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let's start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction. The abstract mentions using MEG brain recording data and a Simple Sentence Corpus. The introduction also refers to these datasets but doesn't add new ones.

Moving to Section 2, which is dedicated to datasets. Here, two main datasets are described:

1. **MEG Dataset**: This is a Magnetoencephalography dataset used to record brain activity while subjects read simple sentences. It includes three different datasets (PassAct1, PassAct2, Act3) with details on the number of sentences and repetitions.

2. **Simple Sentence Corpus (SSC)**: This corpus was created by the authors to train deep neural networks. It consists of 256,145 sentences, combining data from Wikipedia and NELL SVO triples, focusing on active and passive sentences.

In Section 4, the authors mention using BERT and ELMo models, but these are models, not datasets. The experiments in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 use the previously mentioned MEG and SSC datasets.

Looking at the references, I don't find any additional datasets beyond what's already mentioned in the paper.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the metadata fields:

For the MEG Dataset:
- **Creator**: The authors of the paper, as they collected and processed the data.
- **Description**: Details about the MEG recordings, including the number of sentences, repetitions, and preprocessing steps.
- **Title**: "MEG Dataset" as it's a collection of MEG recordings.
- **Issued**: The year the paper was published, 2019.
- **Language**: English, as the sentences are in English.
- **Identifier**: Empty, as no DOI or URL is provided.
- **Theme**: Neuroscience, Brain Activity, Language Processing.
- **Keywords**: MEG, Brain Recording, Sentence Processing.
- **Landing Page**: Empty.
- **Version**: Empty.
- **Format**: Time series data.
- **Task**: Brain activity prediction, language processing.

For the Simple Sentence Corpus (SSC):
- **Creator**: The authors of the paper.
- **Description**: A corpus of 256,145 sentences created from Wikipedia and NELL triples.
- **Title**: "Simple Sentence Corpus (SSC)".
- **Issued**: 2019.
- **Language**: English.
- **Identifier**: Empty.
- **Theme**: Natural Language Processing, Corpus.
- **Keywords**: Sentence Corpus, Active/Passive Sentences.
- **Landing Page**: Empty.
- **Version**: Empty.
- **Format**: Text.
- **Task**: Training deep neural networks, language modeling.

I need to ensure that each field is accurately filled based on the information provided in the paper. No additional datasets are mentioned, so these are the only two to include.
