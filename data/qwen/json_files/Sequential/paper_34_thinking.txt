Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper's title is "Long Distance Relationships without Time Travel: Boosting the Performance of a Sparse Predictive Autoencoder in Sequence Modeling." The authors are Jeremy Gordon, David Rawlinson, and Subutai Ahmad. 

Looking through the abstract, they mention using a predictive autoencoder called bRSM and testing it on two tasks: a non-deterministic version of the MNIST sequence task and next word prediction on the Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset.

In the introduction, they reference N-gram models and their performance on the PTB dataset. They also mention Mikolov et al.'s work on language models using the PTB corpus.

In the experiments section (Section 3), they detail two tasks:
1. **Stochastic Sequential MNIST (ssMNIST)**: This is a custom task they created, not a standard dataset. It involves sequences of MNIST digits but isn't a dataset per se.
2. **Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset**: This is a well-known dataset for language modeling tasks.

They also reference other works, but those don't mention additional datasets. The only datasets explicitly mentioned are MNIST and PTB.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided.

For MNIST:
- **Creator**: Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges.
- **Description**: Handwritten digit images.
- **Title**: MNIST.
- **Issued**: 1998.
- **Language**: Not applicable.
- **Identifier**: URL to MNIST.
- **Theme**: Computer Vision.
- **Keywords**: Handwritten digits, classification.
- **Landing Page**: MNIST official site.
- **Version**: Not mentioned.
- **Format**: Image.
- **Task**: Classification.

For PTB:
- **Creator**: Lori A. Levin, et al.
- **Description**: Corpus of American English text.
- **Title**: Penn Treebank.
- **Issued**: 1993.
- **Language**: English.
- **Identifier**: URL to PTB.
- **Theme**: Natural Language Processing.
- **Keywords**: Language modeling, corpus.
- **Landing Page**: PTB official site.
- **Version**: Not mentioned.
- **Format**: Text.
- **Task**: Language modeling.

I'll ensure each dataset is correctly formatted with the required metadata fields.
