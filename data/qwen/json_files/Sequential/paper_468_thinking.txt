Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about a system developed for the SMM4H 2019 Shared Task, specifically Task 1, which involves classifying tweets mentioning Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR). 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the task and the use of LSTM neural networks with Twitter GloVe embeddings. The introduction talks about the Shared Task and the challenges involved. 

In the "2 Dataset" section, the paper describes the dataset used for Task 1. It mentions that the dataset contains 24,606 tweets manually tagged, with around 10% indicating ADRs. The dataset includes user ID, tweet ID, and a binary annotation. The preprocessing steps include normalizing Twitter strings and handling elongated words. 

The authors also mention using Twitter GloVe embeddings, which are pre-trained on tweets. However, this is a model, not a dataset, so I shouldn't include it as a dataset. 

Looking through the references, I don't see any other datasets mentioned. The paper doesn't reference external datasets beyond the one used for Task 1. 

So, the only dataset mentioned is the one provided for Task 1 of the SMM4H 2019 Shared Task. I'll need to extract its metadata based on the information given in the paper.
