Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is about the Concordia NLG Surface Realizer at SRa19. It discusses their participation in the shallow track of the 2019 NLG Surface Realization Shared Task. They mention using data from the Universal Dependency (UD) datasets. 

Looking at the sections, the "3 Dataset" section details their use of training and development sets from the UD datasets for 11 languages. They specifically mention the English datasets: en ewt-ud-train, en gum-ud-train, en lines-ud-train, and en partut-ud-train. These are part of the UD datasets.

I should check the references for the UD datasets. The paper cites de Marneffe et al., 2014, which is the Universal Dependencies project. 

Now, I'll structure the dataset information using the specified metadata vocabulary. The creator is the team behind the UD project, which includes de Marneffe, Dozat, Silveira, Haverinen, Ginter, Nivre, and Manning. The description is based on how the paper uses these datasets for surface realization tasks. The title is "Universal Dependencies Dataset". The issued year is 2014. The language is English. The identifier is the DOI from the reference. The theme is Natural Language Processing and Syntax. Keywords include surface realization, dependency parsing, and natural language generation. The landing page is the UD project's website. The format is text, and the task is surface realization.

I need to ensure all fields are correctly filled based on the paper's information. The creators are the authors of the UD dataset, not the paper's authors. The description focuses on the paper's usage. The landing page is the official UD site. The task is specific to surface realization as per the paper's focus.
