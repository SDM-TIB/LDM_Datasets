Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, the paper is about quality estimation (QE) in machine translation. It mentions several datasets used in their experiments. 

Looking at the abstract, they mention the WMT 2019 QE task. WMT stands for Workshop on Machine Translation, so they're using datasets from that event.

In the introduction, they talk about the WMT QE dataset, which is used for experiments. They also mention the WMT-2019 QE task with En-De (English-German) and En-Ru (English-Russian) NMT (Neural Machine Translation) datasets.

In the experiments section, they detail their data sources. They use parallel corpora from WMT-18 for En-De and En-Ru. They also mention using QE data from WMT-18 and WMT-19. Additionally, they use back-translated data from Edinburgh systems for En-De and En-Ru.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. WMT QE dataset (from WMT 2019)
2. WMT-2019 En-De-NMT dataset
3. WMT-2019 En-Ru-NMT dataset
4. WMT-18 En-De-SMT dataset
5. WMT-18 En-De-NMT dataset
6. WMT-18 En-Ru-NMT dataset
7. Back-translated data from Edinburgh systems for En-De and En-Ru

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields.
