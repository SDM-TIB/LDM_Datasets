Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about bias in contextualized word representations like ELMo and BERT. I need to identify any datasets mentioned and describe them using the specified metadata vocabulary.

First, I'll read through the paper to spot any datasets. The abstract mentions debiasing methods and target word lists. In the introduction, they talk about word embeddings like word2vec, GloVe, and Fasttext. These are datasets or models, but I'm not sure if they're considered datasets in this context.

Looking at the related work section, they reference studies by Wang et al., May et al., and Kurita et al. These likely involve datasets, but without specific names, it's hard to extract them.

In the Target Word Lists section, they mention using lists from Caliskan et al., which includes pronouns and gender-specific terms. They also reference a list from Gonen and Goldberg. These lists might be datasets, but I'm not certain if they're publicly available or just examples.

The paper also discusses using names from a dataset by Gaddis, which is about racial perceptions. This could be a dataset, but again, I'm not sure of its specifics.

In the Conceptor Debiasing section, they mention using word lists for pronouns, names, and occupations. These lists might be datasets, but without explicit references, it's unclear.

Overall, the paper doesn't explicitly list datasets used beyond word embeddings and target word lists. Since the focus is on word embeddings and their biases, the datasets might be the embeddings themselves or the target word lists used for debiasing.

I think the main datasets here are the word embeddings like ELMo and BERT, but they are models, not datasets. The target word lists used for debiasing might be considered datasets, but they aren't explicitly named or cited with DOIs or URLs.

Given this, I might conclude that no specific datasets are mentioned beyond the word embeddings and target word lists, which aren't detailed enough to extract as datasets.
