Alright, I'm looking at the provided paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper is about sentiment analysis in textual conversations, specifically using Twitter data. 

First, I'll go through the abstract. It mentions using datasets from SemEval-2019 Task 3, which is about emotion detection in text. The authors refer to the training and development sets provided by this task. 

In the introduction, they talk about the challenges of imbalanced data and mention the dataset's distribution. The methods section discusses preprocessing and using word embeddings like GloVe and ELMo, but these are tools, not datasets. 

Looking at the experiments section, they detail the training and development sets from SemEval-2019 Task 3. The results are evaluated on these datasets. 

I don't see any other datasets mentioned. The authors don't reference any other external datasets beyond the ones provided by the SemEval task. 

So, the only dataset mentioned is from SemEval-2019 Task 3. I'll extract the metadata for this dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
