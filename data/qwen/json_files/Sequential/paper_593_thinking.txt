Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, the paper is titled "Spot the Odd Man Out: Exploring the Associative Power of Lexical Resources" by Gabriel Stanovsky and Mark Hopkins. The abstract mentions the creation of an Odd-Man-Out task and datasets. 

Looking through the sections, I see that they created several datasets:

1. **ANOMIACOMMONDEV and ANOMIACOMMONTEST**: These are derived from the Anomia card game, focusing on common words. They split into development and test sets.

2. **ANOMIAPROPERDEV and ANOMIAPROPERTEST**: These are similar but focus on proper nouns.

3. **CROWDSOURCED843**: A larger dataset created through crowdsourcing, validated by experts.

4. **HYPERNYMS500**: A dataset created by the authors using hypernym relationships.

5. **COLORS500**: Another dataset focusing on color associations.

Each of these datasets is described in the paper, and their purposes are outlined. I need to extract each dataset's metadata as per the given vocabulary.

I'll structure each dataset with the required fields, ensuring that creators are correctly identified, descriptions are accurate, and other metadata like themes and keywords are included.
