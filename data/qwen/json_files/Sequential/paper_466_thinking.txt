Alright, I'm looking at the provided paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper is about a machine comprehension task using an ensemble of attention-based BiLSTM models. 

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction. The abstract mentions the SemEval-2018 Task 11, which is about machine comprehension using common-sense knowledge. This task likely uses a specific dataset, but it's not explicitly named here.

Moving to the introduction, the authors reference several datasets in the context of machine comprehension. They mention the CNN/DailyMail datasets, which are commonly used for text summarization and reading comprehension tasks. These datasets are cited in the references as well.

In the literature review section, the authors discuss models like the Attentive Reader and others that were tested on the CNN/DailyMail datasets. This confirms that these datasets are relevant to their work.

Looking at the references, the CNN/DailyMail datasets are cited, providing details about their creators, descriptions, and themes. 

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The focus is on the models and their performance, not on additional datasets beyond the ones used for evaluation in prior work.

So, the only dataset explicitly mentioned is the CNN/DailyMail dataset. I'll structure the JSON accordingly, including the necessary metadata fields based on the information provided.
