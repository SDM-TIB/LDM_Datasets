Alright, I'm trying to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about pretraining sentence encoders and evaluating them on various tasks. I'll go through each section to identify datasets.

First, in the introduction, they mention using the GLUE benchmark for evaluation. GLUE is a collection of tasks, but it's considered a dataset in this context.

Looking at the related work section, they reference ELMo, which uses the WikiText-103 dataset for language modeling. So WikiText-103 is another dataset.

In the pretraining tasks section, they mention several datasets:
- WikiText-103 (already noted)
- 1 Billion Word Language Model Benchmark (BWB)
- WMT14 English-German and WMT17 English-Russian for machine translation
- Reddit comment dataset by Yang et al.
- MSR Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC)
- STS-Benchmark (STS)
- Multi-Genre NLI Corpus (MNLI)
- Quora Question Pairs (QQP)
- Winograd Schema Challenge (WNLI)

Each of these is a distinct dataset used for different pretraining tasks. I'll list each with their creators, descriptions, and other metadata as per the paper.

I need to ensure I capture all these datasets and their details accurately. Some might be part of the GLUE benchmark, but they're listed separately in the paper, so I'll include them individually.
