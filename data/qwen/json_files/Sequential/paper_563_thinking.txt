Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract to get an overview. It's about lexical substitution for evaluating compositional distributional models. They mention creating a dataset from an English corpus with manual all-words lexical substitution annotations.

Looking at the introduction, they reference the adjective-noun-verb-adjective-noun (ANVAN) dataset by Pickering and Frisson (2001). They also mention the CoInCo corpus by Kremer et al. (2014), which is used for lexical substitution.

In the methodology section, they describe the ANVAN-LS dataset, which they created from the CoInCo corpus. This dataset includes 165 ANVAN phrases with 732 target words for lexical substitution. They also mention using the ukWaC, BNC, and English Wikipedia corpora for building co-occurrence matrices.

They reference the context2vec model by Melamud et al. (2016), which is a lexical substitution model, but it's not a dataset itself.

In the results section, they discuss their experiments on the ANVAN-LS dataset and compare it with other models, but no new datasets are mentioned here.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. ANVAN-LS dataset created by the authors.
2. CoInCo corpus by Kremer et al. (2014).
3. ukWaC, BNC, and English Wikipedia corpora used for co-occurrence matrices.

I'll extract metadata for each of these datasets based on the information provided in the paper.
