Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) as the benchmark dataset used for experiments. That's one dataset.

Next, I'll go through the introduction and related work sections. They reference various studies but don't mention additional datasets beyond SST.

In the experiments section, the paper specifically uses SST for both binary and fine-grained sentiment analysis tasks. It also mentions using ELMo embeddings, but ELMo is a model, not a dataset.

Looking through the references, I don't find any other datasets mentioned. The only dataset clearly identified is the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST).

So, the dataset to extract is SST with the provided metadata.
