Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract to get an overview. It mentions using four benchmark datasets: Google-news, Twenty-news-groups, Brown Corpus, and Question Classification. These are likely the main datasets used.

Looking into the introduction, the paper talks about redundancy detection and text classification. It references several studies, but I'm focusing on the datasets mentioned.

In Section 4, the authors detail their experiments and datasets. They list four datasets:

1. **Google-news**: A dataset from Google news.
2. **Twenty-news-groups**: A collection from twenty news groups.
3. **Brown Corpus**: A standard American English corpus.
4. **Question Classification**: A dataset for classifying questions.

Each dataset's statistics are provided in Table 2, including size, vocabulary, total words, mean sentence length, metadata, and classes.

I need to extract metadata for each dataset. The creators are the authors of the datasets, but since the paper doesn't provide specific creators, I'll note them as empty. Descriptions are based on how the paper uses them. Titles are as mentioned. Issued dates aren't provided, so they'll be empty. Languages are English. Identifiers, landing pages, versions, formats, and tasks are filled based on the paper's usage.

I'll structure each dataset into the required JSON format, ensuring all fields are included even if some are empty.
