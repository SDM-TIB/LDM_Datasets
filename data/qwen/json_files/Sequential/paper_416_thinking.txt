Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about a system called HIT-SCIR for the CoNLL 2019 shared task on Meaning Representation Parsing. The task involves parsing semantic graphs across different frameworks like SDP, UCCA, EDS, and AMR.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to understand the context. The paper mentions that the system uses BERT embeddings and a transition-based parser. It also refers to the CoNLL 2019 shared task, which likely involves specific datasets.

Looking at the references, I see citations for various semantic graph banks. For example, SDP is mentioned with references to Oepen et al., 2015, which includes DM, PSD, and PAS. EDS is cited from Flickinger et al., 2017, and UCCA from Abend and Rappoport, 2013. AMR is referenced from Banarescu et al., 2013.

Each of these frameworks corresponds to a dataset used in the shared task. The paper doesn't explicitly list the datasets, but the frameworks themselves are datasets used for semantic parsing. The authors mention that their system was evaluated on these datasets, achieving high scores in the competition.

I need to extract each dataset's metadata. The creators are the authors cited in the references. The descriptions are based on how each framework is used in the paper. The titles are the names of the frameworks. The issued year is taken from the references. The language is English since the datasets are in English. The landing pages are URLs provided in the paper or references. The themes are related to semantic parsing and NLP. Keywords include the framework names and related tasks. The format is text, and the tasks are semantic parsing.

I'll structure each dataset with the required fields, ensuring that each is accurately represented based on the information in the paper.
