Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "CLaC Lab at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Contextual Emotion Detection Using a Combination of Neural Networks and SVM" by Elham Mohammadi, Hessam Amini, and Leila Kosseim. It describes their system for the SemEval 2019 Task 3, which focuses on contextual emotion detection in dialogues.

Looking through the abstract, the authors mention a dataset of 3-round dialogues. This is the primary dataset used for their task. They refer to it as the EmoContext dataset, which is part of SemEval 2019 Task 3.

In the introduction, they discuss various emotion detection datasets, such as the one collected by Abdul-Mageed and Ungar (2017) with 1/4 billion tweets. However, this dataset isn't used in their current work; they're focusing on dialogues instead.

The methodology section details their neural network architecture and SVM classifier but doesn't mention additional datasets beyond the EmoContext dataset.

In the results section, they compare their system with the baseline provided by the EmoContext organizers, confirming that the EmoContext dataset is the primary one used.

The references include several datasets, but only the EmoContext dataset is explicitly used in this paper. Other datasets like the one by Abdul-Mageed and Ungar are mentioned but not used here.

So, the only dataset mentioned in this paper is the EmoContext dataset from SemEval 2019 Task 3.
