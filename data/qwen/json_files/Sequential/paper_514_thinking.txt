Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions the FrameBank corpus, which is a Russian semantic resource. That's one dataset.

Moving to the introduction, the authors discuss various resources like FrameNet and PropBank but specifically mention FrameBank again. So, FrameBank is definitely a key dataset here.

In the related work section, they reference other works but don't introduce new datasets. The pipeline section again refers to FrameBank for training their models. 

Looking at the experiments section, they mention using the FrameBank corpus for evaluation. They also talk about preprocessing steps using tools like MyStem and UDPipe, but these are tools, not datasets.

The references section lists various resources, but the only dataset explicitly mentioned is FrameBank.

So, the only dataset mentioned in the paper is FrameBank. I'll need to gather the metadata for FrameBank based on the information provided in the paper.

The creators of FrameBank are mentioned in the references as Lyashevskaya and Kashkin. The description is that it's a Russian corpus with predicate-argument structures. It was published in 2015. The language is Russian. The format is text. The tasks include semantic role labeling.

I don't find any specific identifier, landing page, or version mentioned in the paper, so those fields will be empty.
