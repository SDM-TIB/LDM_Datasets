Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about BERT-AL, a model that combines BERT with LSTM to handle longer texts. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract and introduction don't mention any datasets, but the experiments section does. 

Looking at section 4, "EXPERIMENT," the authors mention the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. They describe it as containing news articles and highlights, and they used it for text summarization tasks. 

I need to extract metadata about this dataset. The creators are Hermann et al., as cited in the paper. The description is that it's a dataset for text summarization with news articles and highlights. The title is "CNN/Daily Mail dataset." The year isn't explicitly mentioned, but Hermann's work was published in 2015. The language is English since it's news articles. There's no DOI or URL provided, so those fields are empty. The theme is text summarization, and keywords include text summarization, news articles, and highlights. The landing page is empty, no version is mentioned, the format is text, and the task is text summarization.

I should structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring all fields are correctly filled based on the paper's description.
