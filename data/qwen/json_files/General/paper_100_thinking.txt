Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about generating adversarial examples for neural machine translation using a reinforcement learning approach. 

First, I'll go through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned. 

In the **Abstract**, the authors mention experiments on two mainstream NMT architectures, RNN-search and Transformer, but no specific datasets are named here.

Moving to the **Introduction**, they discuss the fragility of NMT systems when faced with less than ideal inputs. They reference studies by Belinkov and Bisk (2017) and Lee et al. (2018), but these are not datasets themselves.

In the **Preliminaries** section, they describe NMT architectures but don't mention any datasets.

The **Approach** section details their reinforcement learning method but doesn't reference datasets.

In the **Experiments** section, they mention several datasets:

1. **De-En (German-English)**: They use NIST test sets for Chinese-English (Zh-En) and WMT test sets for English-French (En-Fr). They also mention using Europarl-v7 and news-commentary-v10 for En-De and En-Fr experiments.

2. **En-De (English-German)**: They use WMT14 and WMT15 datasets.

3. **En-Fr (English-French)**: They use WMT14 and WMT15 datasets.

4. **Zh-En (Chinese-English)**: They use NIST test sets.

Additionally, they mention using LDC datasets (LDC2002E18, LDC2003E14, LDC2004T08, LDC2005T06) for Chinese-English experiments.

In the **Results** section, they discuss their findings on these datasets but don't introduce new datasets.

The **References** section includes citations for tools like sacreBLEU and libraries like NLPIR-ICTCLAS and Moses tokenizer, but these are not datasets.

So, the datasets mentioned are:

- NIST test sets for Zh-En
- WMT test sets for En-Fr
- Europarl-v7
- news-commentary-v10
- WMT14 and WMT15 datasets for En-De and En-Fr
- LDC datasets (LDC2002E18, LDC2003E14, LDC2004T08, LDC2005T06) for Zh-En

Now, I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is described with the appropriate metadata.
