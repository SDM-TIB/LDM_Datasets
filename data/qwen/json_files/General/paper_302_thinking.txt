Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions that the authors achieved new state-of-the-art results on several standard ED datasets, including AIDA-CoNLL, MSNBC, AQUAINT, ACE2004, and WNED-WIKI. These are likely the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I'll check the introduction and related work sections for any additional datasets. The introduction reiterates the use of these datasets, so no new ones are mentioned there.

Moving on to the experiments section, the authors conducted extensive experiments using six standard ED datasets: AIDA-CoNLL, MSNBC, AQUAINT, ACE2004, WNED-CWEB, and WNED-WIKI. This adds WNED-CWEB to the list.

I'll also look at the references to find more details about each dataset, such as their creators and publication years. However, the paper doesn't provide explicit references for each dataset, so I'll rely on the information given in the paper.

Now, I'll compile the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper. Each dataset's description will include the creators, a brief description, title, publication year, and other relevant metadata fields.

Finally, I'll structure the information into a JSON format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with all the required metadata fields.
