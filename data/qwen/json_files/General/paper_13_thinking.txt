Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses pre-training strategies for Chinese BERT and introduces MacBERT. It mentions several datasets used for evaluation.

Looking at Section VI, which details the experiments, I see references to various datasets:

1. **CMRC 2018**: A Chinese machine reading comprehension dataset.
2. **DRCD**: Another Chinese reading comprehension dataset in Traditional Chinese.
3. **CJRC**: A Chinese judicial reading comprehension dataset.
4. **ChnSentiCorp**: A Chinese sentiment analysis dataset.
5. **THUCNews**: A Chinese news classification dataset.
6. **TNEWS**: A Chinese text classification dataset.
7. **XNLI**: A cross-lingual natural language inference dataset, including Chinese.
8. **LCQMC**: A large-scale Chinese question matching corpus.
9. **BQ Corpus**: A Chinese sentence semantic equivalence dataset.
10. **OCNLI**: A Chinese natural language inference dataset.

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata:

- **Creators**: Look for authors or organizations mentioned in the dataset references.
- **Description**: Based on how the paper describes the dataset's use.
- **Title**: The dataset's name.
- **Issued**: The year the dataset was published.
- **Language**: Typically Chinese for these datasets.
- **Identifier**: DOI or URL if available.
- **Theme**: Categories like NLP, Reading Comprehension, etc.
- **Keywords**: Tags relevant to the dataset.
- **Landing Page**: URL or DOI link.
- **Version**: If mentioned.
- **Format**: Text, etc.
- **Task**: The NLP tasks the dataset is used for.

I'll ensure each dataset is accurately described based on the paper's usage and references.
