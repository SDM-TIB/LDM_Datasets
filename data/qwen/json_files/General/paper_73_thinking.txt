Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper introduces Segatron, a segment-aware Transformer model. It mentions using WikiText-103 for language modeling experiments and BERT pre-training on English Wikipedia and BookCorpus.

Looking into the sections, the "Experiments" section details the use of WikiText-103 for autoregressive language modeling. The dataset is described as a large word-level dataset with 103M tokens, 28K articles, and an average length of 3.6K tokens per article. It's used to evaluate the model's performance.

Next, the pre-training section mentions using English Wikipedia and BookCorpus. These are large text corpora used for training language models. The paper doesn't provide specific details about these datasets beyond their use for pre-training.

I also check the references for any additional datasets, but they don't mention any beyond WikiText-103, Wikipedia, and BookCorpus.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided.

For WikiText-103:
- Creator: The authors of the paper, as they used the dataset.
- Description: Large word-level dataset with 103M tokens, 28K articles.
- Title: WikiText-103
- Issued: 2017 (from the reference)
- Language: English
- Identifier: Empty (no DOI provided)
- Theme: Language Modeling
- Keywords: Language modeling, perplexity, segmentation
- Landing Page: Empty
- Version: Empty
- Format: Text
- Task: Language Modeling

For English Wikipedia:
- Creator: Wikimedia Foundation
- Description: Large corpus of English Wikipedia articles.
- Title: English Wikipedia
- Issued: Ongoing (no specific year)
- Language: English
- Identifier: Empty
- Theme: Text Corpora
- Keywords: Pre-training, text corpus
- Landing Page: Empty
- Version: Empty
- Format: Text
- Task: Pre-training

For BookCorpus:
- Creator: The authors of the papers cited (Zhu et al. 2015)
- Description: Large text corpus of books.
- Title: BookCorpus
- Issued: 2015
- Language: English
- Identifier: Empty
- Theme: Text Corpora
- Keywords: Pre-training, text corpus
- Landing Page: Empty
- Version: Empty
- Format: Text
- Task: Pre-training

I need to ensure that the creators are correctly identified. For WikiText-103, the creators are the authors of the paper since they used the dataset. For English Wikipedia, the creator is Wikimedia Foundation. For BookCorpus, the creators are the authors cited in the reference.

I'll structure each dataset with the appropriate metadata fields as specified.
