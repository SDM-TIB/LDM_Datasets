Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses Multi-Perspective Inferrer (MPI) for Natural Language Inference (NLI). It mentions experiments on SNLI and MultiNLI datasets. So, I note these two datasets.

Next, I'll check the sections where datasets are described. In the "4.1 Datasets" section, the authors detail the use of SNLI and MultiNLI. SNLI is the Stanford Natural Language Inference dataset, and MultiNLI is the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference dataset. Both are commonly used in NLI tasks.

I'll look for more datasets mentioned elsewhere. The paper references other studies but doesn't mention additional datasets beyond SNLI and MultiNLI. Therefore, these are the only datasets to include.

Now, I'll gather metadata for each dataset. For SNLI, the creators are Bowman et al., and it's from 2015. It's in English and used for NLI tasks. MultiNLI, created by Williams et al. in 2018, is also in English and used for NLI, particularly across genres.

I'll structure this information into JSON format, ensuring each dataset has the required metadata fields. I'll make sure to include creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, languages, themes, keywords, and tasks.

Finally, I'll compile the JSON response, ensuring it's correctly formatted and only includes the datasets mentioned in the paper.
