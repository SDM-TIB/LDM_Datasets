Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about meta-answering in machine reading, and it mentions several datasets. Let me go through it step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets are being used. The abstract mentions the Natural Questions dataset, which is a key part of their experiments. 

Moving on to the introduction, they talk about machine reading and mention SQuAD and NewsQA as examples of datasets used in previous work. These are important datasets in the field of question answering.

In the sections discussing their experiments, they specifically mention the Natural Questions dataset again, which they use to evaluate their meta-answering framework. They also reference BERT, which is a model trained on large datasets, but BERT itself isn't a dataset, so I won't include it.

Looking at the related work section, they mention TREC, which is a conference that hosts various datasets, including the TREC QA dataset. This is another dataset they might be referring to, though it's not explicitly used in their experiments.

I also need to check the references for any additional datasets. The references include SQuAD, NewsQA, and Natural Questions, confirming their use in the paper.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. Natural Questions
2. SQuAD
3. NewsQA
4. TREC QA

Each of these datasets is used for different purposes, like training models or evaluating performance in question answering tasks. I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields based on the information provided in the paper.
