Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses the QUASE framework, which uses QA data to improve various NLP tasks. It mentions several datasets in the context of experiments and evaluations.

Looking at the sections, I see references to datasets like SQuAD, TriviaQA, NewsQA, QAMR, QA-RE, and others. Each of these datasets is used in different parts of the experiments to evaluate the performance of the QUASE framework.

For each dataset, I need to extract the metadata fields as specified. I'll start by identifying the creators, which are the authors of the respective datasets. Then, I'll write a brief description based on how the paper uses or describes each dataset. The title is straightforward, and the issued year is taken from the dataset's publication.

Next, I'll note the language of the dataset if applicable, usually English unless specified otherwise. The identifier might be a DOI or URL if available. The theme and keywords should reflect the dataset's content and usage in the paper. Landing pages are URLs where the dataset can be accessed, if provided.

I'll also check for specific versions of the datasets and their formats, such as text or JSON. Finally, I'll list the tasks each dataset is used for, based on the paper's experiments.

I need to ensure that each dataset is accurately described and that all required fields are filled out. If any information isn't available, I'll leave that field empty as per the instructions.

Now, I'll proceed to list each dataset with the extracted metadata in JSON format.
