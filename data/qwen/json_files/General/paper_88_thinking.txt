Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper is about image captioning using an image transformer. It mentions datasets used for training and evaluation.

Looking at the sections, the "4 Experiment" section details the datasets. It mentions MSCOCO (Microsoft COCO) and Visual Genome. 

For MSCOCO:
- The creators are the authors of the MSCOCO dataset, which I need to find from the references. The paper cites it as [17], so I'll look up that reference. It's by Chen et al., 2015.
- Description: It's a dataset with images and captions, used for training and testing.
- Title: MSCOCO.
- Issued: 2015.
- Language: English.
- Identifier: The URL provided in the paper is http://cocodataset.org.
- Theme: Computer Vision, Image Captioning.
- Keywords: Image captions, object detection.
- Landing Page: http://cocodataset.org.
- Format: Image, Text.
- Task: Image Captioning.

For Visual Genome:
- Creators are Krishna et al., 2017.
- Description: A dataset with images and annotations for objects, attributes, and relationships.
- Title: Visual Genome.
- Issued: 2017.
- Language: English.
- Identifier: The URL is http://visualgenome.org.
- Theme: Computer Vision, Scene Understanding.
- Keywords: Object detection, scene graphs.
- Landing Page: http://visualgenome.org.
- Format: Image, Text.
- Task: Object Detection, Scene Graph Construction.

I need to ensure I'm only including datasets mentioned in the paper and not the authors of the paper itself. Both datasets are used for training and evaluation in the context of image captioning.
