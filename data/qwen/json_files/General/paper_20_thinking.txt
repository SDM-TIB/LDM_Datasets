Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses question generation from paragraphs using hierarchical models. It mentions experiments on two datasets: SQuAD and MSMARCO.

Next, I'll check the sections where datasets are described. In the "Experimental Setup" section, under "Datasets," the authors detail their use of SQuAD and MSMARCO. SQuAD is described as containing Wikipedia articles and questions, while MSMARCO includes web passages and questions.

I'll also look for references to these datasets in the paper's references. SQuAD is cited as Rajpurkar et al., 2016, and MSMARCO as Nguyen et al., 2016.

Now, I'll gather the metadata for each dataset. For SQuAD, the creators are the authors from the reference, the description is based on the paper's usage, and the year is 2016. Similarly, for MSMARCO, the creators are from Nguyen et al., the description is taken from the paper, and the year is 2016.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring that each field is filled based on the information provided in the paper. If a field isn't mentioned, I'll leave it empty.

Finally, I'll compile the datasets into a JSON format, making sure to include all the necessary details for each dataset as per the metadata vocabulary.
