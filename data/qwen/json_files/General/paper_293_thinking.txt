Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses character-based neural machine translation (NMT) using the Transformer architecture, comparing it to BPE models. It mentions experiments on EN-DE language pairs using news (WMT) and TED talks (IWSLT) datasets.

Next, I'll look into the sections where datasets are specifically mentioned. In the "3. Representation units for Transformer" section, the authors detail their experiments using WMT and IWSLT datasets. They mention:

1. **WMT (Wikipedia Machine Translation) dataset**: Used for high-resource settings, including news translation tasks.
2. **IWSLT (International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation) dataset**: Specifically the 2014 corpus, used for low-resource settings, containing TED Talks transcriptions and translations.

I'll check the references for more details. The WMT dataset is cited as [47] and [48], and IWSLT as [49]. From the references, I gather that WMT is a large-scale dataset for machine translation, while IWSLT focuses on spoken language translation, particularly TED Talks.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the metadata fields:

- **dcterms:creator**: For WMT, the creators are the Wikimedia Foundation and the European Parliament. For IWSLT, it's the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation.
- **dcterms:description**: WMT is a collection of parallel texts from Wikipedia and Europarl. IWSLT includes TED Talks transcriptions and translations.
- **dcterms:title**: "WMT" and "IWSLT 2014".
- **dcterms:issued**: WMT is ongoing, so I'll note it as "Ongoing". IWSLT 2014 was published in 2014.
- **dcterms:language**: Both datasets involve multiple languages, but the paper focuses on EN-DE.
- **dcterms:identifier**: URLs for WMT and IWSLT.
- **dcat:theme**: "Machine Translation" and "Spoken Language Translation".
- **dcat:keyword**: Relevant terms like "Parallel Corpora", "Translation Data".
- **dcat:landingPage**: URLs to access the datasets.
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Not specified for WMT, but IWSLT has a 2014 version.
- **dcterms:format**: Text.
- **mls:task**: "Neural Machine Translation".

I'll ensure each dataset is accurately described based on the paper's usage and the references provided.
