Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Scheduled Sampling for Transformers" by Tsvetomila Mihaylova and Andrė F. T. Martins. It discusses applying scheduled sampling to Transformer models for machine translation tasks.

Looking through the sections, I find that the authors conducted experiments on two language pairs. In the "Experiments" section, they mention:

1. **IWSLT 2017 German-English (DE-EN)**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks. It's a standard benchmark dataset for evaluating translation models.

2. **KFTT Japanese-English (JA-EN)**: Another dataset used for machine translation, specifically for Japanese to English translation.

I should check if these datasets are cited in the references. Scanning the references, I find:

- For **IWSLT 2017**, the citation is:
  > Mauro Cettolo, Marcello Federico, Luisa Bentivogli, Jan Niehues, Sebastian Stärk, Katsuhiro Sudoh, Koichiro Yoshino, and Christian Federmann. 2017. Overview of the IWSLT 2017 evaluation campaign. In International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, pages 2–14.

- For **KFTT**, the citation is:
  > Graham Neubig. 2011. The Kyoto free translation task.

Now, I'll compile the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper and references.
