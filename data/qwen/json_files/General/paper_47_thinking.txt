Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, using sequence-to-sequence models. It mentions experiments on datasets, so I should focus on those.

In the "4.1.1. Datasets" section, the paper explicitly lists two datasets:

1. **CMUDict 0.7b**: This is a publicly available dataset. The paper describes its split into training, validation, and test sets, and mentions the vocabulary sizes for graphemes and phonemes. It also notes that stress markings are removed.

2. **Internal English Dataset**: This is an internal dataset used by the authors. It includes more words and retains stress markings. The vocabulary sizes are larger than CMUDict.

Additionally, the paper mentions using unlabeled data crawled from the web, but this isn't a dataset per se but rather supplementary data used for training.

I should also check the references for any other datasets, but from the provided text, only CMUDict and the internal dataset are explicitly mentioned as datasets used in experiments.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided.

For CMUDict 0.7b:
- **Creator**: The paper doesn't specify the creators, so I'll leave it as an empty list.
- **Description**: As per the paper, it's a public dataset with specific splits and vocabulary sizes.
- **Title**: "CMUDict 0.7b"
- **Issued**: The paper doesn't provide a publication year, so it's empty.
- **Language**: English.
- **Identifier**: No DOI or URL provided.
- **Theme**: Speech Processing, Phonetics.
- **Keywords**: Grapheme-to-phoneme, Phoneme, Vocabulary.
- **Landing Page**: Empty.
- **Version**: 0.7b.
- **Format**: Text.
- **Task**: Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion.

For the Internal English Dataset:
- **Creator**: The authors of the paper, as it's their internal dataset.
- **Description**: Details the splits, vocabulary sizes, and inclusion of stress markings.
- **Title**: "Internal English Dataset"
- **Issued**: Empty.
- **Language**: English.
- **Identifier**: Empty.
- **Theme**: Speech Processing, Phonetics.
- **Keywords**: Grapheme-to-phoneme, Phoneme, Vocabulary.
- **Landing Page**: Empty.
- **Version**: Empty.
- **Format**: Text.
- **Task**: Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion.

I'll ensure that each dataset is accurately represented with the provided metadata fields.
