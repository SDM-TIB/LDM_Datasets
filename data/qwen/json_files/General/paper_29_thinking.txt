Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction. The abstract mentions the DSTC8-track1 challenge, which involves a multi-domain dialogue system. It doesn't specify a dataset yet, but the introduction discusses task-oriented dialogue systems and mentions the MultiWOZ dataset later on.

Moving to the Related Works section, I don't see any datasets mentioned. The Task description section is where I find the first dataset: MultiWOZ. It's described as a large-scale multi-domain dialogue dataset containing seven domains related to traveling. The paper also mentions the ConvLab platform, but that's a tool, not a dataset.

In the HCEDS architecture section, the authors reference BERT, which is a pre-trained model, not a dataset. The Dialogue Management section again doesn't mention any datasets. The Multi-intent NLG section also doesn't reference any datasets.

Looking at the Experiments section, the authors detail their setup and mention the MultiWOZ dataset again, providing statistics like the number of dialogues, turns, and tokens. They also reference the ConvLab platform for evaluation but don't mention any other datasets.

The Results and Conclusion sections focus on their system's performance and don't introduce new datasets. The references at the end include the MultiWOZ dataset, confirming its use in the paper.

So, the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper is MultiWOZ. I'll extract its metadata based on the information provided.
