Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, I'll look through the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections. The paper discusses Visual Question Generation (VQG) and mentions several datasets used for evaluation.

In the introduction, the authors reference the VQG task and mention datasets like V QGCOCO and V QA1.0. These are established datasets in the field of visual question generation.

Looking further into the methodology section, the authors detail their experiments using two datasets: V QGCOCO and V QA1.0. They describe how these datasets are structured and used for training and evaluation.

I'll also check the references section to find the full citations for these datasets. For V QGCOCO, the citation is from Mostafazadeh et al. (2016), and for V QA1.0, it's from Antol et al. (2015).

Now, I'll compile the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper. This includes the creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, themes, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

Finally, I'll structure this information into a JSON format as specified, ensuring all fields are accurately filled based on the dataset details from the paper.
