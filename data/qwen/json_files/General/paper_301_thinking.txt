Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, the paper is titled "French Question Answering Dataset (FQuAD)" and is authored by Martin da Hois, Wacim Belblidia, Tom Brendl, Quentin Heinrich, and Maxime Vidal. The abstract mentions the introduction of FQuAD, a French Reading Comprehension dataset. So, FQuAD is definitely one dataset.

Looking further into the introduction, the authors reference several other datasets in the context of their work. They mention SQuAD1.1 and SQuAD2.0, which are well-known English datasets. Additionally, they reference CoQA, QuAC, HotpotQA, KorQuAD, SberQuAD, CMRC 2018, and PIAF. These are all datasets used in the field of Question Answering.

Next, I'll go through each section to ensure I don't miss any datasets. In the Related Work section, they discuss various datasets like NewsQA, QuAC, HotpotQA, KorQuAD, SberQuAD, CMRC 2018, and PIAF. They also mention XQuAD and MLQA, which are cross-lingual datasets.

In the Dataset Collection section, they describe FQuAD1.0 and FQuAD1.1, which are versions of their dataset. They also mention the PIAF dataset, which is another French dataset released after their work.

In the Experiments section, they discuss using SQuAD1.1 and its French translation for cross-lingual experiments. They also mention the use of CamemBERT and FlauBERT models, but these are models, not datasets.

Finally, in the Results and Discussion sections, they refer back to FQuAD and the other datasets mentioned earlier. They don't introduce any new datasets in these sections.

So, compiling all the datasets mentioned:

1. FQuAD1.0
2. FQuAD1.1
3. SQuAD1.1
4. SQuAD2.0
5. CoQA
6. QuAC
7. HotpotQA
8. KorQuAD
9. SberQuAD
10. CMRC 2018
11. PIAF
12. XQuAD
13. MLQA

Now, I'll create the JSON metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
