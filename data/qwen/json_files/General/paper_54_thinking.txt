Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about a Universal Transforming Geometric Network (UTGN) for protein structure prediction. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned. I notice that in the section "3.1 TRAINING DATA AND BATCHING," the authors mention using the CASP12 ProteinNet dataset. They also mention a thinning of 90%, which results in around 50,000 structures. 

CASP12 stands for the 12th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction. It's a competition where participants submit predictions for protein structures, and their models are evaluated. The ProteinNet dataset is likely a collection of protein structures used for training and testing machine learning models in this domain.

I need to gather metadata about this dataset. The creators of the dataset would be the organizers of CASP12, but since the paper doesn't specify individual creators, I'll note that as an empty list. The description should reflect that it's a dataset used for protein structure prediction, containing around 50,000 structures after thinning. The title is "CASP12 ProteinNet Dataset." 

The issued year isn't explicitly mentioned in the paper, but CASP12 took place in 2016, so I'll use that. The language is English, as it's a scientific dataset. There's no specific identifier or URL provided, so those fields will be empty. The theme is related to bioinformatics and protein structure prediction. Keywords include protein structure prediction, CASP, and ProteinNet. The landing page is also not provided, so it remains empty. The format is likely a structured dataset, possibly in a format like PDB (Protein Data Bank). The task is protein structure prediction.

I should ensure that all the fields are correctly filled based on the information available. Since the paper doesn't provide some details, like the creators or specific URLs, those fields will be left empty as per the instructions.
