Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about the Clued Recurrent Attention Model (CRAM) and its applications in image classification and inpainting tasks. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets are being used. The abstract mentions that CRAM is evaluated on two tasks: image classification and inpainting. It also refers to a dataset used for obtaining rough saliency maps, which is the MSRA10k dataset. 

Next, I'll look into the methodology section. The paper describes using a CNN-DecNN model pre-trained on the MSRA10k dataset to obtain saliency maps. MSRA10k is a large dataset for saliency detection, containing 10,000 annotated images. 

Then, in the experiments section, the paper mentions the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset. SVHN is used for image inpainting tasks, where the model is tested on completing occluded digits. The SVHN dataset contains 73,257 training and 26,032 testing images of house numbers, each 32x32 RGB.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors don't reference any additional datasets beyond MSRA10k and SVHN. 

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided:

1. **MSRA10k Dataset**:
   - **Creators**: The paper cites M.-M. Cheng, N. J. Mitra, X. Huang, P. H. Torr, and S.-M. Hu as the creators.
   - **Description**: It's a dataset for saliency detection with 10,000 images and annotations.
   - **Title**: MSRA10k.
   - **Issued**: 2015.
   - **Theme**: Computer Vision, Saliency Detection.
   - **Keywords**: Saliency detection, image segmentation.
   - **Task**: Image segmentation, saliency detection.

2. **SVHN Dataset**:
   - **Creators**: Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu, and A. Y. Ng.
   - **Description**: Contains 73,257 training and 26,032 testing images of house numbers.
   - **Title**: Street View House Numbers (SVHN).
   - **Issued**: 2011.
   - **Theme**: Computer Vision, Object Recognition.
   - **Keywords**: Image inpainting, digit recognition.
   - **Task**: Image inpainting, object recognition.

I'll ensure that each dataset's metadata is accurately captured based on the paper's description and references.
