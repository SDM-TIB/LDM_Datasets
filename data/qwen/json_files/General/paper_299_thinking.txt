Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Integrating Multimodal Information in Large Pretrained Transformers" and is authored by Wasifur Rahman, Md. Kamrul Hasan, Sangwu Lee, Amir Zadeh, Chengfeng Mao, Louis-Philippe Morency, and Ehsan Hoque. The abstract mentions the use of CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets for multimodal sentiment analysis.

Looking further into the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of modeling face-to-face communication, which involves language, acoustic, and visual modalities. They mention using these datasets to evaluate their proposed framework.

In the experiments section, the authors detail their use of CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets. They describe the features extracted from each modality and the baseline models they compared against. The results section provides performance metrics on these datasets, showing the effectiveness of their approach.

I also check the references to find more details about these datasets. The references for CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI are provided, which include the authors and publication years.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information extracted from the paper and its references.
