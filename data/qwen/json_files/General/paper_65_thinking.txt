Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper introduces LXMERT, a framework for vision-and-language tasks. It mentions datasets used for pre-training and evaluation.

Looking at the sections, I see references to several datasets:

1. **VQA (Visual Question Answering)**: Mentioned in the introduction and results. It's a dataset where models answer questions about images. The paper uses VQA v2.0.

2. **GQA (Grounded Question Answering)**: Another dataset for visual question answering, more complex than VQA. The paper evaluates on GQA.

3. **NLVR2 (Natural Language for Visual Reasoning 2)**: A dataset for visual reasoning tasks, where models determine if a statement about two images is true. The paper shows significant improvements on NLVR2.

4. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: Used for image captioning and pre-training. The paper aggregates data from COCO and others.

5. **Visual Genome**: Another dataset for image captioning and pre-training, used alongside COCO.

6. **ImageNet**: Referenced as a backbone model for visual understanding, but it's more of a model than a dataset used in the paper.

Now, I'll extract each dataset's metadata based on the paper's description.
