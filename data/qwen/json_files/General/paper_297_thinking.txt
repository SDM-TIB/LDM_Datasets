Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions experiments on two ranking tasks: MS MARCO passage reranking and TREC Web Track ad hoc document ranking. So, MS MARCO and TREC Web Track are datasets used in this paper.

Next, I'll check the introduction. It again refers to MS MARCO and TREC Web Track as the benchmarks for their experiments. No new datasets are mentioned here.

Moving on to the experimental methodologies section, the paper details the datasets used. MS MARCO includes question-like queries and candidate passages, with relevance labels. TREC Web Track uses ClueWeb documents and queries from 2009-2012, with relevance judgements.

I should also look for any references or citations that might provide more details about these datasets. The references section mentions the TREC Web Track and MS MARCO, but no specific creators or DOIs are provided in the paper.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information extracted:

1. **MS MARCO**: Used for passage reranking, includes queries and passages with relevance labels.
2. **TREC Web Track**: Used for ad hoc document ranking, includes ClueWeb documents and queries with relevance judgements.

I'll ensure each dataset entry includes the required fields, even if some information isn't explicitly provided in the paper.
