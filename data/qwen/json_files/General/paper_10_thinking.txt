Alright, I'm trying to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about a deep patent landscaping model using Transformer and Graph Embedding. The authors mention several datasets, so I need to identify each one and extract their metadata.

First, I'll read through the paper to find any datasets. The abstract mentions benchmark datasets for patent landscaping. In the introduction, they talk about the lack of well-defined benchmark datasets. Then, in section 3, they describe the KISTA datasets for patent landscaping. They mention four specific datasets: MPUART, MWDFSTechnology, MRRG, and GOCS.

Each of these datasets is built using Google BigQuery and based on search queries from a Korean patent attorney. The datasets are used to evaluate the proposed model. The authors provide details about the number of patents, valid patents, and URLs for each dataset.

I need to create a JSON entry for each dataset. The metadata includes the creator, description, title, issued date, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For the creators, the paper's authors are Seokkyu Choi, Hyeonju Lee, Eunjeong Park, and Sungchul Choi. They are the ones who created the datasets mentioned in the paper.

The description for each dataset should reflect how they were used in the paper, such as the number of patents and valid patents, and their purpose in evaluating the model.

The titles are straightforward: MPUART, MWDFSTechnology, MRRG, and GOCS.

The issued date isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll leave it as an empty string.

The language isn't specified, so it remains empty.

The identifier and landing page URLs are provided in the paper, so I'll include those.

The themes are related to patent landscaping and technology classification.

Keywords include patent landscaping, patent classification, and the specific technology areas of each dataset.

The landing page URLs are provided, so I'll use those.

There's no specific version mentioned, so that field remains empty.

The format is text since the datasets are based on patent documents.

The tasks involve patent classification and patent landscaping.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each dataset with the appropriate metadata.
