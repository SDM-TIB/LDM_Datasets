Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Combating Adversarial Misspellings with Robust Word Recognition" by Danish Pruthi, Bhuwan Dhingra, and Zachary C. Lipton from Carnegie Mellon University. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of the datasets used. The abstract mentions that they propose a word recognition model to handle adversarial misspellings and evaluate it on sentiment analysis and paraphrase detection tasks. They reference the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) and the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC). 

Looking into the sections, the paper discusses experiments on the SST dataset, which is a well-known dataset for sentiment analysis. They also mention the IMDB movie reviews dataset as part of their experiments. Additionally, they reference the BERT model, which is trained on a large corpus, but I'm not sure if that's considered a dataset in this context.

In the "Experiments and Results" section, they specifically mention the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) and the IMDB dataset. The SST is used for sentiment analysis, and IMDB is used for training a background model. They also mention the MRPC dataset for paraphrase detection.

I need to check if these datasets are explicitly mentioned with their creators, descriptions, and other metadata. The paper cites the SST as (Socher et al., 2013) and the IMDB as (Maas et al., 2011). The MRPC is cited as (Dolan and Brockett, 2005). 

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata:
- **dcterms:creator**: The authors of the dataset.
- **dcterms:description**: How the dataset is described in the paper.
- **dcterms:title**: The name of the dataset.
- **dcterms:issued**: The year the dataset was published.
- **dcterms:language**: The language of the dataset.
- **dcterms:identifier**: DOI or URL if available.
- **dcat:theme**: Thematic categories.
- **dcat:keyword**: Keywords related to the dataset.
- **dcat:landingPage**: URL for accessing the dataset.
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Specific version if mentioned.
- **dcterms:format**: Format of the dataset.
- **mls:task**: Tasks the dataset is used for.

I'll make sure to only include datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper and avoid any assumptions about datasets not referenced.
