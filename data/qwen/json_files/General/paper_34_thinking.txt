Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper's title is "Long Distance Relationships without Time Travel: Boosting the Performance of a Sparse Predictive Autoencoder in Sequence Modeling." The authors are Jeremy Gordon, David Rawlinson, and Subutai Ahmad. 

Looking through the abstract, they mention using a predictive autoencoder called bRSM and testing it on two tasks: a non-deterministic version of the MNIST sequence task and next word prediction on the Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset.

In the introduction, they reference N-gram models and their performance on the PTB dataset. They also mention Mikolov et al.'s work on language models using the PTB corpus.

In the experiments section, they detail two tasks:
1. Stochastic Sequential MNIST (ssMNIST): This involves sequences of MNIST digits. They mention a grammar with 8 sub-sequences of 9 digits each.
2. Language modeling on the Penn Treebank dataset: They use preprocessing as per Mikolov et al. and compare their results with other models.

In the references, they cite Mikolov et al. for the PTB dataset and mention the Penn Treebank in their experiments.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. MNIST (used in the ssMNIST task)
2. Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset

Now, I'll extract the metadata for each dataset based on the provided vocabulary.
