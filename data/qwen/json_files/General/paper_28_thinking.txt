Alright, I'm trying to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about adversarial analysis of natural language inference systems. Let me go through the paper step by step to identify the datasets.

First, the abstract mentions SNLI and MNLI datasets. SNLI is the Stanford Natural Language Inference dataset, and MNLI is the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference dataset. These are standard datasets used in NLI tasks.

In the introduction, the paper talks about BERT and MT-DNN models performing well on these datasets. It also mentions that these datasets have annotation artifacts, leading models to use shortcuts. This indicates that SNLI and MNLI are central to the discussion.

Moving to the related work section, the paper references several adversarial datasets. One is from Glockner et al. (2018), which involves modifying SNLI examples with single word replacements based on WordNet. Another is from Naik et al. (2018), which creates a dataset by modifying MNLI examples based on error analysis. The third is from McCoy et al. (2019), which tests syntactic heuristics with examples generated from templates.

In the models section, the paper uses MNLI for evaluation. The overall results and analysis sections discuss performance on these adversarial datasets, particularly focusing on McCoy et al.'s dataset, which tests lexical, subsequence, and constituent heuristics.

The fine-grained comparison and experiments with parses as input further analyze performance on McCoy's dataset. The conclusion reiterates the use of these datasets to probe model understanding.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. SNLI
2. MNLI
3. Glockner et al.'s dataset (2018)
4. Naik et al.'s dataset (2018)
5. McCoy et al.'s dataset (2019)

Each of these datasets is described in the paper, and their creators, descriptions, and other metadata can be extracted from the references and context provided.
