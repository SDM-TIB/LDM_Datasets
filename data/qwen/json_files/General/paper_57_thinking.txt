Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Empirical Evaluation of Sequence-to-Sequence Models for Word Discovery in Low-resource Settings" by Marcely Zanon Boito, Aline Villavicencio, and Laurent Besacier. It discusses the use of different sequence-to-sequence models for word discovery from phoneme sequences in low-resource languages.

Looking through the sections, I find that the datasets used are mentioned in the Experimental Settings section, specifically in subsection 2.2: Parallel Speech Corpora.

The paper mentions two main datasets:
1. **EN-FR (English-French) Corpus**: This is a 33,192 sentences multilingual extension from LibriSpeech, with English audio books automatically aligned to French translations. It's also down-sampled to 5K utterances for comparison.
2. **MB-FR (Mboshi-French) Corpus**: A 5,130 sentences corpus from the language documentation process of Mboshi, an endangered language spoken in Congo-Brazzaville.

I need to extract metadata for each dataset using the specified vocabulary.

For EN-FR Corpus:
- **Creator**: The authors of the dataset are not explicitly mentioned in the paper, but it's an extension of LibriSpeech, which is created by V. Panayotov et al. (reference [20] in the paper).
- **Description**: A multilingual corpus with English and French translations, used for evaluating word discovery models.
- **Title**: EN-FR Corpus
- **Issued**: The year is not explicitly mentioned, but LibriSpeech was introduced in 2015.
- **Language**: English and French
- **Identifier**: No DOI or URL provided in the paper.
- **Theme**: Speech Processing, Language Documentation
- **Keyword**: Parallel corpus, speech translation, low-resource
- **Landing Page**: Not provided.
- **Version**: Not mentioned.
- **Format**: Text, Phoneme sequences
- **Task**: Word discovery, Speech translation

For MB-FR Corpus:
- **Creator**: The authors are P. Godard, G. Adda, M. Adda-Decker, J. Benjumea, L. Besacier, J. Cooper-Leavitt, G.-N. Kouarata, L. Lamel, H. Maynard, M. Mueller, and others (reference [19] in the paper).
- **Description**: A corpus for Mboshi, an endangered language, aligned with French translations, used for evaluating word discovery models.
- **Title**: MB-FR Corpus
- **Issued**: The year is 2017, as per the reference.
- **Language**: Mboshi and French
- **Identifier**: No DOI or URL provided.
- **Theme**: Speech Processing, Language Documentation
- **Keyword**: Endangered language, speech translation, low-resource
- **Landing Page**: Not provided.
- **Version**: Not mentioned.
- **Format**: Text, Phoneme sequences
- **Task**: Word discovery, Speech translation

I need to structure this information into JSON format, ensuring all fields are correctly filled based on the paper's content.
