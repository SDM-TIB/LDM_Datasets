Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions the FEVER challenge, which is a benchmark for evidence-based claim verification. So, FEVER is a dataset used in this paper.

Moving to the introduction, the authors discuss the FEVER task in detail. They mention that the FEVER dataset consists of 185K generated claims labeled as SUPPORTED, REFUTED, or NOT ENOUGH INFO. The claims are based on the introductory sections of 50K Wikipedia pages. This confirms that FEVER is a key dataset used here.

In the related work section, the authors reference other datasets like MS MARCO and MultiNLI. MS MARCO is a dataset for passage re-ranking, and MultiNLI is for natural language inference. These datasets are mentioned as they resemble parts of the FEVER task but are not directly used in this paper. However, since they are referenced, they should be included as datasets mentioned.

The methods section doesn't introduce new datasets but focuses on how BERT is used for evidence retrieval and claim verification. The results section again refers to FEVER, confirming its use.

Looking at the references, I find citations for FEVER, MS MARCO, and MultiNLI. Each has its own creators, descriptions, and themes. I'll need to structure each dataset with the required metadata fields.

For FEVER, the creators are Thorne et al., and it's a benchmark for claim verification. MS MARCO is cited by Nguyen et al. and is used for passage re-ranking. MultiNLI, by Williams et al., is for natural language inference across multiple genres.

I'll structure each dataset with the appropriate fields: creator, description, title, issued year, language, identifier, theme, keyword, landing page, version, format, and task. Since some fields like identifier and landing page aren't provided, they'll be left empty.

Finally, I'll compile all identified datasets into a JSON array, ensuring each entry is correctly formatted according to the metadata vocabulary.
