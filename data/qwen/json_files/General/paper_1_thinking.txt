Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about PAWS-X, a cross-lingual adversarial dataset for paraphrase identification. 

First, I'll read through the abstract to get an overview. It mentions PAWS-X as a new dataset with 23,659 human-translated pairs in six languages. It also references PAWS, which is another dataset. So, I know there are at least two datasets here: PAWS and PAWS-X.

Next, I'll look into the introduction. It talks about existing work, including PAWS, which was introduced by Zhang et al. in 2019. PAWS consists of paraphrase pairs from Wikipedia and Quora. So, PAWS is definitely one dataset.

Then, the paper introduces PAWS-X as an extension of PAWS, translated into six languages. This means PAWS-X is another dataset. I need to note down both.

I'll check the references section to find more details about these datasets. For PAWS, the reference is Zhang et al., 2019. For PAWS-X, it's the same authors but the paper is about PAWS-X specifically.

I should also look for any other datasets mentioned. The paper mentions Multi30k and Opusparcus as existing multilingual datasets for paraphrase identification. So, those are two more datasets.

Now, I'll summarize the datasets:

1. PAWS: Created by Zhang et al., 2019. It's an English dataset with paraphrase pairs from Wikipedia and Quora. It's used for paraphrase identification.

2. PAWS-X: Created by the same authors, it's an extension of PAWS into six languages. It includes human-translated pairs and is used for cross-lingual paraphrase identification.

3. Multi30k: Created by Elliott et al., 2016. It's a multilingual dataset for paraphrase identification, focusing on English-German image descriptions.

4. Opusparcus: Created by Creutz, 2018. It's another multilingual dataset for paraphrase identification, covering six languages.

I need to make sure I capture all the metadata for each dataset as per the given vocabulary. For each, I'll extract the creator, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For PAWS and PAWS-X, the creators are the same. The description for PAWS is about English paraphrase pairs, while PAWS-X is the multilingual extension. The languages for PAWS are English, and for PAWS-X, it's six languages.

Multi30k and Opusparcus are other datasets used for comparison. Their creators and descriptions are as mentioned in the references.

I should also note the URLs if available. The paper provides a GitHub link for PAWS-X, so that's the landing page.

Finally, I'll structure all this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately represented with all the necessary metadata fields.
