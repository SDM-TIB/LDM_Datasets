Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses machine translation systems for the WMT19 Similar Language Translation Task, specifically between Spanish and Portuguese. They mention using the Transformer architecture and a novel 2D alternating RNN model.

Looking into the corpus description in Section 3.1, the training data includes several datasets: JCR, Europarl, news-commentary, and wikititles. Each of these is a corpus used for training the machine translation models.

I need to extract metadata for each dataset. Let's break them down:

1. **JCR Corpus**: I'm not sure about the creators, but it's likely a standard corpus. The description mentions it's used for training. The title is "JCR". The year isn't provided, so it's empty. Language is Spanish and Portuguese. No identifier, landing page, or version. Format is text, and the task is machine translation.

2. **Europarl Corpus**: This is a well-known corpus from the European Parliament. Creators are the European Union. Description is similar to JCR. Title is "Europarl". Year is 2017 as per the reference. Language is Spanish and Portuguese. No identifier or landing page. Format is text, task is machine translation.

3. **News-Commentary Corpus**: This is part of the WMT datasets. Creators are the WMT organizers. Description is for training. Title is "News-Commentary". Year is 2019. Language is Spanish and Portuguese. No identifier or landing page. Format is text, task is machine translation.

4. **Wikititles Corpus**: Another WMT dataset. Creators are WMT organizers. Description is for training. Title is "Wikititles". Year is 2019. Language is Spanish and Portuguese. No identifier or landing page. Format is text, task is machine translation.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring all necessary information is included where available.
