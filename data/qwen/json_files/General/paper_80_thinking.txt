Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Enhancing Machine Translation with Dependency-Aware Self-Attention" and it's authored by Emanuele Bugliarello and Naoaki Okazaki. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of the datasets used. The abstract mentions experiments on standard translation tasks, including WMT English-German, English-Turkish, and WAT English-Japanese. These are likely datasets used for evaluation.

Looking into the introduction, the authors reference several studies and datasets. They mention the News Commentary v11 (NC11) dataset, which is used for English-German and German-English tasks. They also refer to the WMT16, WMT17, and WMT18 datasets for English-German, English-Turkish, and English-Japanese translations, respectively. Additionally, the WAT (Workshop on Asian Translation) dataset is mentioned for English-Japanese tasks.

In the experiments section, the authors detail their use of these datasets. They mention NC11, WMT16, WMT17, WMT18, and WAT datasets. Each of these datasets is used for different language pairs and translation tasks.

I'll need to gather the metadata for each dataset. For each dataset, I'll look for the creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For example, the News Commentary v11 dataset is created by the authors of the paper, but I need to check if it's a standard dataset with known creators. Similarly, WMT datasets are organized by the Workshop on Machine Translation, so the creators would be the organizers or the specific contributors.

I'll also need to determine the language of each dataset, which is typically the language pair used in the translation tasks. The format is text, as these are translation datasets. The themes would be related to machine translation and natural language processing. Keywords would include terms like "machine translation," "parallel corpus," and specific language pairs.

I'll structure each dataset entry with the appropriate metadata fields, ensuring that each field is filled based on the information provided in the paper. If some information isn't explicitly mentioned, I'll leave those fields empty or use placeholders.

Finally, I'll compile all the datasets into a JSON format, making sure each entry is correctly structured and all required fields are included.
