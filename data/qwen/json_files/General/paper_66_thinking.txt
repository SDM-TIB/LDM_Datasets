Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions BERT and a masked translation model, but these are models, not datasets. 

Moving to the sections, I see that the paper evaluates their approach on the WMTa14 English-German translation dataset. This is a well-known dataset in machine translation. The authors mention preprocessing the dataset using Moses and byte pair encoding. 

Additionally, they reference the newstest-2013 and newstest-2014 as validation and test sets. These are subsets of the WMT dataset. 

I also notice that they use a pretrained model trained on 5M monolingual sentences from WMT NewsCrawl 2007-2008. This indicates that the WMT NewsCrawl dataset is another dataset they used, though it's not explicitly named in the paper beyond the reference to NewsCrawl.

I should check if there are any other datasets mentioned. The paper doesn't reference any other datasets beyond these. 

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset:

1. **WMTa14 English-German Translation Dataset**
   - Creator: The WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation) organizers.
   - Description: A dataset containing parallel English-German sentences used for machine translation evaluation.
   - Title: WMTa14 English-German Translation Dataset
   - Issued: 2014
   - Language: English, German
   - Identifier: Not provided in the paper.
   - Theme: Machine Translation, Natural Language Processing
   - Keywords: Machine translation, parallel corpus, WMT
   - Landing Page: Not provided.
   - Version: Not specified.
   - Format: Text
   - Task: Machine Translation

2. **WMT NewsCrawl 2007-2008**
   - Creator: WMT organizers.
   - Description: A monolingual dataset used for pretraining language models.
   - Title: WMT NewsCrawl 2007-2008
   - Issued: 2007-2008
   - Language: English
   - Identifier: Not provided.
   - Theme: Language Modeling, Pretraining
   - Keywords: News crawl, monolingual corpus, WMT
   - Landing Page: Not provided.
   - Version: Not specified.
   - Format: Text
   - Task: Language Modeling, Pretraining

I need to ensure that the creators are correctly identified as the WMT organizers, not the authors of the paper. The datasets are used for evaluation and pretraining, so their tasks are machine translation and language modeling.

I should also note that the newstest-2013 and newstest-2014 are subsets of the WMT dataset, so they don't need separate entries but can be mentioned under the main dataset.

Finally, I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring all fields are filled appropriately based on the information extracted.
