Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract to get an overview. The paper introduces the XQA dataset for cross-lingual OpenQA. So, XQA is definitely one dataset.

Next, I'll look through the introduction and related work sections. The authors mention several other datasets and resources used in their research. For example, they reference DrQA, which uses Wikipedia as a corpus. They also mentionTriviaQA, SQuAD, and others like XNLI and MUC-4 for named entity recognition.

In the methodology section, they discuss using Wikipedia's "Did you know" feature and WikiData for answers. They also mention using THUMT and Google Translate for machine translation, which are tools but not datasets.

Looking at the experimental setup, they reference BERT and its multilingual version, which are models, not datasets. They also mention the use of GloVe and Skip-gram word vectors, which are embeddings but not datasets.

In the results section, they don't introduce new datasets but discuss their own XQA dataset's performance.

Finally, in the references, I see citations for datasets like SQuAD, TriviaQA, XNLI, and others, which were mentioned in the paper.

So, compiling all this, the datasets mentioned are:

1. XQA (their own dataset)
2. Wikipedia (used as a corpus)
3. TriviaQA
4. SQuAD
5. XNLI
6. MUC-4
7. WikiData (used for answers)
8. THUMT and Google Translate (though these are tools, they might be considered as datasets if they include translation data)

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring accuracy based on the paper's descriptions.
