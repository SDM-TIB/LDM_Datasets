Alright, I'm trying to extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "TENER: Adapting Transformer Encoder for Named Entity Recognition" by Hang Yan, Bocao Deng, Xiaonan Li, and Xipeng Qiu. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to understand the context. The paper focuses on Named Entity Recognition (NER) using a modified Transformer encoder. They mention evaluating their model on six NER datasets. 

Looking into the "Experiments" section, I find details about the datasets used. They mention two English datasets: CoNLL2003 and OntoNotes 5.0. For Chinese NER, they use four datasets: OntoNotes 4.0, MSRA, Weibo, and Resume. 

I'll need to gather information about each dataset, such as their creators, descriptions, publication years, languages, and any other relevant metadata. 

For CoNLL2003, the creators are I. S. Sang and F. De Meulder, published in 2003, focusing on English NER with four entity types. 

OntoNotes 5.0, created by Chen et al. in 2019, is an English dataset with various domains and entity types. 

OntoNotes 4.0, by Weischedel in 2011, is a Chinese dataset. 

MSRA, created by Levow in 2006, focuses on Chinese news text. 

Weibo, by Peng and Dredze in 2015, is a Chinese social media dataset. 

Resume, by Zhang and Yang in 2018, is a Chinese dataset for resume analysis. 

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring accuracy based on the paper's references.
