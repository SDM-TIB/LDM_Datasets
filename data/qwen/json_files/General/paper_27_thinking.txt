Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "E-BERT: Efficient-Yet-Effective Entity Embeddings for BERT" by Nina Poerneraa, Ulli Waltingera, and Hinrich Sch A utzeaa. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of Wikipedia2Vec entity vectors and evaluates E-BERT on several tasks. 

In the introduction, the authors reference BERT and other entity-enhanced versions like ERNIE and KnowBert. They mention using LAMA (Language Model Analysis) benchmark for unsupervised QA and FewRel for relation classification. 

Looking at Section 4, they discuss the LAMA benchmark, specifically LAMA-Google-RE and LAMA-T-REx. They also introduce LAMA-UHN as a subset of LAMA. 

In Section 5, they mention FewRel for relation classification and AIDA for entity linking. 

Now, I'll check the references to find more details about these datasets. 

- **LAMA (Language Model Analysis)**: Created by Petroni et al. (2019). It's a benchmark for evaluating factual and commonsense knowledge in LMs. 
- **FewRel**: Compiled by Zhang et al. (2019). It's a subset of the FewRel corpus for relation classification.
- **AIDA**: Compiled by Hoffart et al. (2011). It's a dataset for entity linking in news articles.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields based on the information from the paper and references.
