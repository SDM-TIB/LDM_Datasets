Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of the datasets used. The abstract mentions the British National Corpus (BNC) and LibriSpeech. The introduction also refers to these datasets.

Moving to the Materials and Methods section, specifically section 2.1, the datasets are clearly outlined. The paper uses LibriSpeech for training and BNC for testing out-of-domain behavior. 

LibriSpeech is described as a corpus of read English speech, primarily used for ASR tasks. It's cited from reference [7], which I assume provides more details about its creation and content. The dataset is in English and consists of audio data.

The British National Corpus (BNC) is mentioned as containing spontaneous conversations from UK English speakers. It's cited from reference [8]. This dataset is also in English and includes audio data with word-level alignments.

I need to ensure I capture all metadata fields for each dataset. For LibriSpeech, the creator is the author of reference [7], which is Vassil Panayotov. The description is based on how the paper uses it. The title is "LibriSpeech". The issued year is 2015. The language is English. The identifier is the URL provided in the paper. The theme is "Speech Recognition". Keywords include "Speech corpus", "English", "Read speech". The landing page is the URL. The format is audio. The task is "Automatic Speech Recognition".

For BNC, the creator is from reference [8], which includes John Coleman and others. The description is based on the paper's usage. The title is "British National Corpus". The issued year is 2012. The language is English. The identifier is the URL provided. The theme is "Speech Recognition". Keywords include "Speech corpus", "English", "Spontaneous conversations". The landing page is the URL. The format is audio. The task is "Automatic Speech Recognition".

I should ensure that all fields are correctly filled based on the paper's information and avoid any assumptions beyond what's provided.
