Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about efficient contextual representation learning without a softmax layer. It mentions several datasets used in their experiments and evaluations.

First, I'll go through the paper section by section. In the introduction, they mention ELMo, which is a contextual representation model. ELMo is trained on the One Billion Word Benchmark, so that's one dataset.

Looking at the experiments section, they evaluate their model on several downstream tasks. These include SNLI, Coref, SST-5, NER, and SRL. Each of these tasks uses specific datasets:

1. **SNLI**: The Stanford Natural Language Inference dataset.
2. **Coref**: The CoNLL 2012 shared task dataset.
3. **SST-5**: The Stanford Sentiment Treebank.
4. **NER**: The CoNLL 2003 dataset.
5. **SRL**: The dataset from the CoNLL 2013 shared task.

Additionally, they mention using the Common Crawl corpus for training word embeddings, which is another dataset.

I need to structure each of these datasets with the required metadata fields. For each dataset, I'll extract the creator, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For example, the One Billion Word Benchmark was created by Chelba et al. in 2013. It's a large text corpus used for training language models. The format is text, and it's used for tasks like language modeling.

Similarly, SNLI is a dataset for natural language inference, created by Bowman et al. in 2015. It's used for tasks like text classification and inference.

I'll go through each dataset mentioned, gather the necessary information, and structure them into JSON format as specified.
