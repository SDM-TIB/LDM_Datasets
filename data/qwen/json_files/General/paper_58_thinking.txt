Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let's go through the paper step by step.

First, the paper is about the NICT-2 NMT system at WAT-2019. It describes their neural machine translation system and the strategies they used, like long warm-up and self-training.

Looking through the paper, I see references to several datasets:

1. **ASPEC Corpus**: This is mentioned in the introduction and the system summary. It's used for the ASPEC.en-ja and ASPEC.ja-en tasks. The paper cites Nakazawa et al., 2016, as the source.

2. **TDDC Corpus**: Also mentioned in the system summary, used for the TDDC.ja-en task. The paper refers to it as the Timely Disclosure Documents Corpus.

3. **WAT-2019**: This is the workshop where the paper was presented, but it's not a dataset itself.

I need to check if there are any other datasets mentioned. The paper also mentions using back-translations generated by sampling, but that's a method, not a dataset.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset:

- **ASPEC Corpus**: Created by Nakazawa et al., it's a scientific paper excerpt corpus. It's used for NMT tasks, specifically for English-Japanese and Japanese-English translation. The language is English and Japanese. The format is text.

- **TDDC Corpus**: Created by Nakazawa et al., it's a corpus of timely disclosure documents. Used for Japanese-English translation tasks. The language is Japanese and English. The format is text.

I don't find any specific versions, landing pages, or DOIs mentioned in the paper for these datasets, so those fields will be empty.

Finally, I'll compile this information into the required JSON format.
