Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let's go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper is about a unified language model pre-training for natural language understanding and generation, called UNILM. It mentions several datasets used for evaluation and experiments.

Looking at the sections, I see that datasets are mentioned in the experiments section. Let's list them out:

1. **GLUE Benchmark**: This is a collection of nine language understanding tasks. The paper mentions using it for evaluation.
2. **SQuAD 2.0**: A question answering dataset.
3. **CoQA**: Another conversational question answering dataset.
4. **CNN/DailyMail**: Used for abstractive summarization.
5. **Gigaword**: Another dataset for abstractive summarization.
6. **DSTC7**: Document-grounded dialog response generation task.

Now, I'll go through each dataset to extract the required metadata.
