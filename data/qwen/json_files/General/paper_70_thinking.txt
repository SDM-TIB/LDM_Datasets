Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The abstract mentions analyzing syntactic abstraction in BERT using dependency trees and comparing them to Universal Dependencies (UD) annotations. This suggests that UD datasets are involved.

Moving to the "Models and Data" section (Section 2), the authors detail the datasets used. They mention:

1. **EuroParl**: A multi-parallel sentence dataset used for training syntactic heads. It's cited as (Koehn, 2004).
2. **UDPipe UD 2.0 models**: These are used for automatic annotation. The citation is (Straka and Strakov√°, 2017).
3. **Google Universal Dependency Treebanks (GSD)**: Specifically for Indonesian, Korean, and Japanese. The citation is (McDonald et al., 2013).
4. **UD Turkish Treebank (IMST-UD)**: Cited as (Sulubacak et al., 2016).
5. **PUD treebanks from the CoNLL 2017 Shared Task**: Used for evaluation. Cited as (Nivre et al., 2017).

I'll also check the references section to find the full details for each dataset. For example, EuroParl is a well-known corpus for machine translation, and UD treebanks are part of the Universal Dependencies project.

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields. For each dataset, I'll extract the creator(s), description, title, publication year, language (if applicable), identifier (like DOI or URL), theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For instance, EuroParl is a multilingual corpus used for training, so its theme would be "Natural Language Processing" and "Machine Translation." The format is text, and the task is "Dependency Parsing."

I'll repeat this process for each dataset mentioned, ensuring all fields are accurately filled based on the information provided in the paper.
