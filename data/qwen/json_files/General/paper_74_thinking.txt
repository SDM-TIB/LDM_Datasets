Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about a distantly-supervised neural relation extraction method using BERT and side information. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets are being used. The abstract mentions experiments on Google Distant Supervision (GDS) and Riedel datasets. 

Next, I'll look into the sections where datasets are discussed in detail. In the Introduction, the authors reference the Google Distant Supervision dataset and the Riedel dataset. The Google Distant Supervision dataset is an extension of the Google relation extraction corpus, and the Riedel dataset was created by aligning Freebase with the New York Times corpus. 

In the Experiments section, the authors provide more details about these datasets. The GDS dataset has 5 relations, while the Riedel dataset has 53 relations. They also mention that the Riedel dataset uses sentences from 2005-2006 for training and 2007 for testing. 

I need to extract metadata for each dataset. For each, I'll look for the creator, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks. 

For the Google Distant Supervision (GDS) dataset:
- Creator: The authors of the dataset are not explicitly mentioned in the paper, but it's an extension of Google's work. Since the paper doesn't provide specific creators, I'll leave it as an empty list.
- Description: It's an extension of the Google relation extraction corpus with additional instances from entity pairs.
- Title: Google Distant Supervision (GDS)
- Issued: The year isn't explicitly mentioned, but since the paper was published in 2019, I'll assume the dataset is from around that time or earlier.
- Language: English, as it's based on the Google corpus.
- Identifier: No DOI or URL provided.
- Theme: Relation extraction, Natural Language Processing.
- Keywords: Relation extraction, distant supervision, entity pairs.
- Landing Page: Not provided.
- Version: Not mentioned.
- Format: Text.
- Tasks: Relation extraction.

For the Riedel dataset:
- Creator: The authors are not explicitly mentioned, but it's based on Riedel et al.'s work from 2010.
- Description: Built by aligning Freebase with the New York Times corpus, using sentences from 2005-2006 for training and 2007 for testing.
- Title: Riedel dataset.
- Issued: 2010, as per Riedel et al.'s publication.
- Language: English.
- Identifier: No DOI or URL provided.
- Theme: Relation extraction, Natural Language Processing.
- Keywords: Relation extraction, Freebase, New York Times.
- Landing Page: Not provided.
- Version: Not mentioned.
- Format: Text.
- Tasks: Relation extraction.

I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is properly described with the extracted metadata.
