Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about multi-label categorization of accounts of sexism using a neural framework. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to understand the context. The paper mentions that they crawled data from the Everyday Sexism Project website. This seems like the primary dataset they used. 

Looking further into the dataset construction section, they describe collecting around 20,000 entries from the Everyday Sexism Project, which were then annotated by 10 annotators. They created a dataset with 13,023 accounts of sexism, each tagged with one or more of 23 categories. 

I don't see any other datasets mentioned in the paper. They reference some related work, but those are other studies, not datasets. 

So, the main dataset is from the Everyday Sexism Project. I'll need to structure this information into the required JSON format, including the creator, description, title, etc. 

I should note that the creators are the authors of the paper, but since the dataset is from the Everyday Sexism Project, the creator might be the project itself. However, the paper doesn't specify the creators of the dataset, so I'll leave that as an empty list. 

The description should summarize how the dataset was used and its contents. The title is the name of the dataset, which is the Everyday Sexism Project dataset. The issued date isn't provided, so it's empty. The language is English since the accounts are in English. 

The identifier is the URL provided in the paper: https://everydaysexism.com. The theme is related to gender and social issues. Keywords include sexism, categorization, etc. The landing page is the same as the identifier. 

There's no specific version mentioned, so hasVersion is empty. The format is text since it's textual accounts. The task is multi-label categorization of sexism.

I'll structure all this into the JSON format as specified.
