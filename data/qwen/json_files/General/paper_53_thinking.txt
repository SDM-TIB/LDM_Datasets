Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about propaganda detection using BERT and discusses the Propaganda Techniques Corpus (PTC). 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets. The abstract mentions the PTC, so that's one dataset. The introduction also talks about the PTC and the shared task, which likely uses the same dataset. 

Looking at the methodology section, they mention using the PTC for training, development, and test sets. The dataset includes news articles with sentences labeled as propaganda or not. 

I need to extract metadata for each dataset. The main dataset is the PTC. I'll check the references for more details, but the paper doesn't provide a DOI or URL for the PTC. 

So, the dataset is the Propaganda Techniques Corpus. It's used for propaganda detection tasks, specifically sentence-level and fragment-level classification. The creators are the authors of the paper, but the dataset is cited as Da San Martino et al., 2019. 

The description should include that it's a corpus of news articles with labeled sentences. The language is English, and the format is text. The tasks are sentence-level and fragment-level classification. 

I'll structure this into the required JSON format, including all the necessary fields like creator, description, title, etc. Since the paper doesn't provide a DOI or URL, those fields will be empty.
