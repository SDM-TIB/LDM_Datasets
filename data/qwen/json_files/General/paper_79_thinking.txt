Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about structured pruning of BERT-based question answering models. I need to identify all the datasets used or mentioned in this paper and describe them using the specified metadata vocabulary.

First, I'll read through the paper to spot any dataset names. I notice that the paper mentions SQuAD 2.0 and Natural Questions (NQ). These are both well-known datasets in the field of question answering.

For SQuAD 2.0, I recall that it's a dataset created by Rajpurkar et al. in 2018. It consists of questions generated from Wikipedia passages, with some questions having no answer in the passage. The dataset is used for evaluating machine reading comprehension models.

Natural Questions (NQ) is another dataset, created by Kwiatkowski et al. in 2019. It's based on Google's search queries and provides annotated answers from appropriate passages. This dataset is more natural as the questions were asked by humans without seeing the passages first.

I need to extract metadata for each dataset. For SQuAD 2.0, the creators are Rajpurkar et al., the description is about the dataset's purpose and structure, the title is "SQuAD 2.0", the year is 2018, the language is English, the identifier is the DOI, the theme is NLP and Question Answering, keywords include question answering, machine reading, and the landing page is the official SQuAD website. The format is text, and the task is question answering.

For NQ, the creators are Kwiatkowski et al., the description is about its natural question generation and annotation, the title is "Natural Questions", the year is 2019, the language is English, the identifier is the DOI, the theme is NLP and Question Answering, keywords include natural questions, question answering, and the landing page is the official NQ website. The format is text, and the task is question answering.

I need to ensure that all the metadata fields are correctly filled based on the information from the paper and the datasets' references.
