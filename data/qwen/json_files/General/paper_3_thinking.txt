Alright, I'm trying to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "MULTIQA: An Empirical Investigation of Generalization and Transfer in Reading Comprehension" by Alon Talmor and Jonathan Berant. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of the datasets involved. The abstract mentions that the paper investigates generalization and transfer across ten reading comprehension (RC) datasets. It also introduces MULTIQA, a BERT-based model trained on multiple RC datasets.

Moving to the datasets section, the paper lists ten datasets. The large datasets include SQUAD, NEWSQA, SEARCHQA, TRIVIAQA, and HOTPOTQA. The small datasets are CQ, CWQ, WIKIHOP, COMQA, and DROP. Each dataset is described with details like the source of the context, how questions were generated, and whether it involves multi-hop reasoning.

I'll go through each dataset one by one to extract the required metadata. For each dataset, I'll look for the creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For example, SQUAD is created by Rajpurkar et al., published in 2016, and involves Wikipedia paragraphs. It's used for reading comprehension tasks. Similarly, NEWSQA is created by Trischler et al., published in 2017, and uses CNN articles.

I'll ensure that each dataset's metadata is accurately captured based on the information provided in the paper. If some details aren't explicitly mentioned, I'll leave those fields empty.

Finally, I'll compile all the datasets into a JSON format, making sure each entry is correctly structured according to the specified metadata vocabulary.
