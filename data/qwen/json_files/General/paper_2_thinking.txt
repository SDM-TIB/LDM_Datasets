Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions sarcasm generation and uses a retrieval corpus from Sentencedict.com. That's one dataset.

Next, in the introduction, the authors reference several studies on sarcasm detection and generation. They mention datasets like the one by Ghosh et al. (2020) and Peled and Reichart (2017). These are additional datasets.

Moving to the Related Work section, the authors discuss previous sarcasm generation systems and mention datasets used by Joshi et al. (2015a) and Mishra et al. (2019). These are more datasets.

In the Experimental Setup section, the authors describe their dataset, which is a combination of two existing datasets: one by Ghosh et al. (2020) and another by Peled and Reichart (2017). They merged these datasets to create their test set.

I also note that the authors used the Multi-Genre NLI Corpus (Williams et al., 2018) for training their model. This is another dataset.

Now, I'll list all the datasets identified:

1. Ghosh et al. (2020) dataset
2. Peled and Reichart (2017) dataset
3. Joshi et al. (2015a) dataset
4. Mishra et al. (2019) dataset
5. Multi-Genre NLI Corpus (Williams et al., 2018)
6. Sentencedict.com corpus

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata fields based on the information provided in the paper.
