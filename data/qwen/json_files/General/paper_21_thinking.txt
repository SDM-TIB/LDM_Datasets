Alright, I'm looking at the provided research paper to identify the datasets mentioned. The paper discusses a method for conversational machine comprehension using BERT. 

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction. The abstract mentions two datasets: QuAC and CoQA. These are used to evaluate the proposed method. 

In the introduction, the authors reference QuAC (Choi et al., 2018) and CoQA (Reddy et al., 2018). These are the primary datasets used in their experiments. 

Looking further into the paper, the authors describe their experiments on both QuAC and CoQA. They provide details about the datasets, such as their structure and usage in the context of the research. 

I don't find any other datasets mentioned beyond QuAC and CoQA. The references section confirms the citations for these datasets, providing the necessary details for each.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information extracted from the paper.
