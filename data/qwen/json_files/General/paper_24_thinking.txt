Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions the Transformer architecture and its applications in natural language processing tasks, but doesn't specify any datasets. The introduction also discusses the importance of layer normalization in Transformers without naming specific datasets.

Moving on to the sections, I see that the paper discusses experiments on machine translation tasks. Specifically, it mentions the IWSLT14 German-English (De-En) task and the WMT14 English-German (En-De) task. These are datasets used for evaluating machine translation models.

Additionally, the paper mentions the BERT pre-training task, which uses the English Wikipedia corpus and BookCorpus. These datasets are used for unsupervised pre-training of language models.

I also notice that the paper references other works, such as Vaswani et al. (2017) and Devlin et al. (2018), which are related to the Transformer and BERT models, respectively. However, these references don't introduce new datasets but rather build upon existing ones.

To summarize, the datasets mentioned in the paper are:
1. IWSLT14 German-English (De-En) dataset
2. WMT14 English-German (En-De) dataset
3. English Wikipedia corpus
4. BookCorpus

Each of these datasets is used for different purposes, such as machine translation and language model pre-training. I'll now structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is described with the appropriate metadata.
