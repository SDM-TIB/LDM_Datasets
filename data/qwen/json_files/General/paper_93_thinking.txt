Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses few-shot learning and mentions datasets like MiniImageNet, TieredImageNet, and OfficeHome. These are likely the main datasets used.

Next, I'll look into the sections where experiments and evaluations are described. In Section 5, the authors detail their experimental setups, which include MiniImageNet, TieredImageNet, and OfficeHome. They also mention CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds) in the supplementary material.

Now, I'll gather information about each dataset:

1. **MiniImageNet**: A subset of ImageNet with 100 classes, used for few-shot learning. The authors split it into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **TieredImageNet**: Another subset of ImageNet with more categories, used for large-scale few-shot learning.

3. **OfficeHome**: A dataset with four domains, used for cross-domain few-shot learning.

4. **CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds)**: A dataset for bird species classification, used for few-shot learning tasks.

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata fields based on the information provided in the paper. If specific details like creators or URLs aren't mentioned, I'll leave those fields empty or use placeholders.

Finally, I'll structure the information into JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described according to the metadata vocabulary.
