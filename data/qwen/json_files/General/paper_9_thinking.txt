Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses Visual Question Answering (VQA) and mentions datasets like VQA v2.0 and TDIUC. These are likely the main datasets used.

Next, I'll check the sections where datasets are specifically mentioned. In the "4.1. Dataset" section, the authors clearly state that they conducted experiments on VQA v2.0 and TDIUC datasets. Both are benchmark datasets for VQA tasks.

I should also verify if there are any other datasets mentioned elsewhere in the paper. Scanning through the rest of the document, I don't find any additional datasets. The focus is on these two datasets for their experiments and comparisons.

Now, I'll gather the necessary metadata for each dataset. For VQA v2.0, the creators are Antol et al., and it's a benchmark dataset for VQA. TDIUC is created by Kafke et al. and is another benchmark for diverse question types.

I'll structure the JSON response with the required fields for each dataset, ensuring all metadata points are accurately captured based on the paper's description.
