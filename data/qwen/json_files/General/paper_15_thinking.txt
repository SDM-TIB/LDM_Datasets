Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "VAE-PGN based Abstractive Model in Multi-stage Architecture for Text Summarization" by Hyungtak Choi and others. It discusses their submission to the TL;DR challenge and their proposed model for text summarization.

Looking through the sections, I find that the datasets mentioned are:

1. **TL;DR Reddit Corpus**: This dataset is part of the TL;DR challenge and contains approximately 3 million content-summary pairs from Reddit. It's split into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **CNN/Daily Mail Corpus**: This dataset is used for abstractive summarization tasks. It contains around 287,000 training pairs, 13,368 validation pairs, and 11,490 testing pairs. The non-anonymized version is used here.

I need to extract metadata for each dataset using the specified vocabulary.

For the TL;DR Reddit Corpus:
- **Creator**: The authors are listed as Volkske et al. (2017).
- **Description**: A corpus with 3 million content-summary pairs from Reddit.
- **Title**: TL;DR Reddit Corpus.
- **Issued**: 2017.
- **Language**: English.
- **Theme**: Text Summarization, Social Media.
- **Keywords**: Abstractive summarization, Reddit, TL;DR challenge.
- **Task**: Text Summarization.

For the CNN/Daily Mail Corpus:
- **Creator**: Hermann et al. (2015) and Nallapati et al. (2016).
- **Description**: Contains news articles and their summaries.
- **Title**: CNN/Daily Mail Corpus.
- **Issued**: 2015.
- **Language**: English.
- **Theme**: News Summarization.
- **Keywords**: News articles, Abstractive summarization.
- **Task**: Text Summarization.

I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described with the appropriate metadata.
