Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about fine-tuning BERT for joint entity and relation extraction in Chinese medical text. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets are being used. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on coronary angiography texts collected from Shuguang Hospital. That seems like the main dataset used in the paper.

Looking further into the paper, the authors describe their dataset in section IV.A. They mention that the dataset is collected from coronary arteriography reports in Shanghai Shuguang Hospital. The dataset includes five types of entities and six relations. They also mention that 85% of the "No Relation" instances were discarded for balance purposes. 

I don't see any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The references section lists various sources, but they don't appear to be datasets used in the experiments. 

So, the only dataset mentioned is the one from Shuguang Hospital. I'll need to extract its metadata based on the information provided.
