Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about the Insertion Transformer, which is a model for sequence generation using insertion operations. The task is to identify all datasets mentioned in the paper and describe them using the specified metadata vocabulary.

First, I'll read through the paper to find any mentions of datasets. The paper's abstract mentions the WMT 2014 English-German machine translation task. That's a dataset used for evaluating machine translation models. 

Looking further into the paper, the authors discuss experiments on the WMT 2014 English-German translation dataset. They specifically mention using newstest2013 for development and newstest2014 for testing. These are parts of the WMT dataset.

I need to check if there are any other datasets mentioned. The paper doesn't reference any other datasets beyond the WMT 2014 English-German. It focuses on their model's performance on this specific task.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for the WMT 2014 English-German dataset. The creators are the WMT organizers, but since the paper doesn't specify individual creators, I'll leave that as an empty list. The description will reflect that it's used for machine translation evaluation. The title is straightforward. The issued year is 2014. The language is English and German. There's no specific identifier provided, so that's empty. The theme is machine translation, and keywords include machine translation, WMT, and evaluation. The landing page is the WMT website. The format is text, and the task is machine translation.

I need to ensure that all fields are correctly filled based on the information available. Since the paper doesn't provide detailed references for the dataset beyond its use, some fields might remain empty.
