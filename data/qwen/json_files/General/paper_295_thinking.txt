Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract talks about participating in the WMT18 News Translation Shared Task, which is a dataset. So, WMT18 News Translation Shared Task is one dataset.

Next, I'll check the sections where data and preprocessing are discussed. In section 4, the authors mention using the news.2016.i corpus for backtranslation. This seems like another dataset.

They also mention the news.20{14-17}.et corpora, which is another dataset used for backtranslation.

Additionally, the paper references the WMT16 constrained settings, indicating the use of the WMT16 dataset.

I should also check if there are any other datasets mentioned, such as any other shared tasks or corpora used for training or evaluation. From the provided text, these are the main datasets identified.

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields based on the information extracted from the paper.
