Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Literary Event Detection" and is authored by Matthew Sims, Jong Ho Park, and David Bamman. The main focus of the paper is on developing a new dataset for literary event annotations and comparing various models for event detection.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to understand the context. The abstract mentions the creation of a new dataset for literary events, which is part of LitBank and available on GitHub. This is the primary dataset I need to note.

Next, I'll look into the "Data" section (Section 3) of the paper. It describes the corpus used for annotation, which consists of approximately the first 2000 words of 100 literary works from Project Gutenberg. These works are from the public domain, published before 1923, and include canonical novels and popular genre fiction. The dataset is part of LitBank and is available under a Creative Commons license.

In the "Event annotations" section (Section 4), the authors detail the annotation guidelines and the process. They mention that the dataset includes 7,849 events among 210,532 tokens across 100 books. This dataset is used to train and evaluate models for event detection.

The "Analysis" section (Section 6) uses this dataset to analyze literary prestige and popularity, further emphasizing the dataset's role in the research.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper besides the one they created. They reference Project Gutenberg as the source of their literary works but don't present it as a separate dataset in their work.

So, the only dataset mentioned is their newly created literary event dataset, part of LitBank.
