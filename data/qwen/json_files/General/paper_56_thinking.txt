Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Regularized Context Gates on Transformer for Machine Translation" by Xintong Li and others. It discusses the use of context gates in the Transformer architecture for machine translation tasks.

Looking through the sections, I find that the experiments were conducted on four benchmark datasets. These are mentioned in the introduction and the methodology sections.

1. **NIST IWSLT 2014 ZH-EN**: This dataset is used for Chinese to English translation. It's a standard benchmark in machine translation.

2. **WMT14 EN-DE**: This is the English-German dataset from the 2014 Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT). It's widely used for evaluating translation models.

3. **IWSLT17 FR-EN**: This dataset is for French to English translation, part of the 2017 IWSLT evaluation campaign.

4. **IWSLT14 ZH-EN**: Another Chinese to English dataset from the 2014 IWSLT campaign.

I also check the references to see if there are any additional datasets, but it seems these four are the primary ones used in the experiments.

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields based on the information provided in the paper.
