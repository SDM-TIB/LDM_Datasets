Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Learning Scene Geometry for Visual Localization in Challenging Conditions" by Nathan Piasco, DAsirA SidibA, ValArie Gouet-Brunet, and Cedric Demonceaux. It's about image-based localization using scene geometry information.

Looking through the sections, I find that the authors mention the Oxford RobotCar dataset. This dataset is used for training and testing their method. It's a well-known dataset in the field of robotics and computer vision, containing various data like images, lidar scans, and GPS data.

I check the references section to confirm the details of the Oxford RobotCar dataset. The citation provided is:

- H. Maddern, G. Pascoe, C. Linegar, and P. Newman. "1 year, 1000 km: The Oxford RobotCar dataset." The International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR), 2016.

From this, I gather that the dataset was created by H. Maddern, G. Pascoe, C. Linegar, and P. Newman, and it was published in 2016. The dataset is used for evaluating image-based localization methods, particularly under challenging conditions like cross-season, cross-weather, and night/day scenarios.

The dataset includes images, depth maps, and other sensor data. It's formatted as images and depth maps, and it's used for tasks like visual localization and scene understanding.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper, so the only dataset to include is the Oxford RobotCar dataset.
