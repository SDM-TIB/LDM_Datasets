Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper focuses on Named Entity Recognition (NER) using Twitter data. It mentions introducing a new dataset and referencing existing ones.

Looking through the paper, I find that the authors created a new dataset called the "Temporal Twitter Corpus." They also reference the Broad Twitter Corpus (BTC) by Derczynski et al. (2016). 

For the Temporal Twitter Corpus:
- **Creators**: The authors of the paper, Shruti Rijhwania and Daniel PreotA iuc-Pietro.
- **Description**: 12,000 English tweets annotated with named entities, spanning six years from 2014 to 2019.
- **Title**: "Temporal Twitter Corpus."
- **Issued**: 2020, as the paper was published in 2020.
- **Language**: English.
- **Identifier**: The GitHub URL provided.
- **Theme**: Natural Language Processing, Named Entity Recognition.
- **Keywords**: Twitter, NER, temporal data.
- **Landing Page**: The GitHub link.
- **Format**: Text.
- **Task**: Named Entity Recognition.

For the Broad Twitter Corpus (BTC):
- **Creators**: Leon Derczynski, Kalina Bontcheva, and Ian Roberts.
- **Description**: Contains tweets from 2009 to 2014, with a focus on named entity recognition.
- **Title**: "Broad Twitter Corpus."
- **Issued**: 2016.
- **Language**: English.
- **Identifier**: The paper's reference.
- **Theme**: Natural Language Processing, Named Entity Recognition.
- **Keywords**: Twitter, NER, corpus.
- **Landing Page**: The paper's reference.
- **Format**: Text.
- **Task**: Named Entity Recognition.

I need to ensure that the creators are correctly identified and that all metadata fields are filled based on the information provided in the paper.
