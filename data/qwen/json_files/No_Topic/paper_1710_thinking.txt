Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about detecting racist tweets using demographic word embeddings. I need to identify all the datasets mentioned and describe them using the specified metadata vocabulary.

First, I'll read through the paper to spot any datasets. The paper mentions several studies and datasets used for their research. Let me go through each section carefully.

In the introduction, they reference studies by Xu and Zhu (2010), Kwok and Wang (2013), Warner and Hirschberg (2012), Burnap and Williams (2016), and Waseem and Hovy (2016). These are likely datasets or studies that their work builds upon.

Looking at the Related Work section, they mention datasets used by these authors. For example, Kwok and Wang used tweets from self-identified racist accounts, and Warner and Hirschberg used Yahoo! data for anti-Semitic detection. Burnap and Williams worked on a broader range of hate speech, and Waseem and Hovy focused on demographic features.

In the Data Sets section, the authors describe their own unlabeled and classification datasets. The unlabeled dataset consists of tweets crawled from Twitter, and the classification dataset was created through crowdsourcing to manually annotate tweets as racist or not.

So, the datasets mentioned are:

1. Xu and Zhu's dataset (2010)
2. Kwok and Wang's dataset (2013)
3. Warner and Hirschberg's dataset (2012)
4. Burnap and Williams' dataset (2016)
5. Waseem and Hovy's dataset (2016)
6. The authors' unlabeled dataset
7. The authors' classification dataset

Now, I'll extract the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
