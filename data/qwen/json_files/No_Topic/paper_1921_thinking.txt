Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "T3-Vis: a visual analytic framework for Training and ine-Tuning Transformers in NLP" by Raymond Li and others. The abstract mentions that the framework is available on GitHub, but no datasets are explicitly listed there.

Moving to the introduction, the authors discuss the success of Transformer models like BERT, RoBERTa, and others. They reference datasets such as the Yahoo Answers dataset and the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. These are likely the datasets used in their experiments.

In the case studies section, the authors mention using the Yahoo Answers dataset for topic classification and the CNN/Daily Mail dataset for summarization tasks. These datasets are crucial for their analysis and evaluation of the T3-Vis framework.

I should check the references section to find more details about these datasets. The Yahoo Answers dataset is cited as Zhang et al., 2015, and the CNN/Daily Mail dataset is cited as Hermann et al., 2015.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
