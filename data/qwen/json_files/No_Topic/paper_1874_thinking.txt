Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about multilingual summarization using a polytope model. Let me go through it step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract to get an overview. It mentions that the method was applied to both single-document (MSS) and multi-document (MMS) tasks in three languages: English, Hebrew, and Arabic. They participated in the MultiLing contest of SIGDial 2015. So, the datasets used are likely the ones from the MultiLing 2015 contest.

Looking into the introduction, they talk about summarization tasks and mention their participation in the MultiLing contest. This confirms that the datasets are from that contest. The paper also mentions that they evaluated their system on English, Hebrew, and Arabic corpora.

In the experiments section, they provide tables showing results for MSS and MMS tasks in these three languages. They compare their system with others, including Oracles and Lead as baselines. The datasets used here are the ones provided by the MultiLing 2015 contest for summarization tasks.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The focus is on their summarization model and its performance on the MultiLing datasets. So, the main dataset is the MultiLing 2015 summarization corpus, which includes English, Hebrew, and Arabic documents.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for this dataset based on the information extracted.
