Alright, I'm looking at the provided research paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper is about detecting informative COVID-19 tweets using RoBERTa. 

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction. The abstract mentions a public dataset used for validation with an F1-score of 0.89. The introduction talks about the dataset used in the shared task, which includes informative and uninformative tweets.

In the dataset section (Section 3), it's specified that the training data has 7000 samples, validation 1000, and test 12000. The test set's labels weren't revealed. The preprocessing steps are detailed, but no specific dataset name is given beyond referring to it as the "public dataset."

Looking through the references, I don't see any specific dataset cited beyond the shared task. The paper doesn't mention external datasets like Twitter's API or any other named corpus.

So, the dataset used is the one from the W-NUT 2020 Task 2, which is the COVID-19 tweet classification dataset. It's described in the paper but not given a specific name beyond the task reference.
