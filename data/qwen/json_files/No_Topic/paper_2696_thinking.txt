Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about using self-supervised learning to develop a feature distance metric for MRI image quality assessment. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets are involved. The abstract mentions MRI datasets but doesn't specify any particular ones. Moving on to the introduction, it talks about deep learning algorithms for MRI reconstruction and mentions metrics like PSNR and SSIM. It also references prior work using VGG-16 and other methods, but again, no specific datasets are named here.

Next, I'll look at the methods section. In section 2.1, it explicitly mentions the "fastMRI knee dataset." This is a key point. The fastMRI dataset is a well-known dataset in the MRI reconstruction field, often used for benchmarking deep learning models. The paper splits this dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, which indicates that it's the primary dataset used for their experiments.

I'll check the references to confirm the details of the fastMRI dataset. The reference [14] in the paper points to the fastMRI dataset, which is publicly available and contains raw k-space data and DICOM images of knee scans. This dataset is crucial for their self-supervised learning approach and for evaluating their SSFD metric.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors don't reference any additional datasets for their experiments or comparisons. They focus solely on the fastMRI knee dataset for their study.

So, the only dataset extracted from this paper is the fastMRI knee dataset. I'll gather the necessary metadata for this dataset based on the information provided in the paper and its reference.
