Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about a system submitted to the FinTOC-2020 shared task on financial document structure extraction. The authors describe their approach, which involves a two-step method using transfer learning. 

First, I need to identify any datasets mentioned in the paper. The abstract mentions the FinTOC-2020 shared task, which likely involves a dataset. The introduction also refers to the FinTOC-2020 shared task, indicating that the dataset is central to their work. 

Looking through the sections, the Data section (Section 3) provides more details. It states that the training data consists of 52 English and 47 French financial PDF documents. Each document page has annotations including text and depth for each title. The authors mention the heterogeneity of the documents, showing the complexity of the task.

I should check if there are any other datasets mentioned. The references include other works, but the main dataset used is from the FinTOC-2020 shared task. 

Now, I need to extract the metadata for this dataset. The creators would be the authors of the dataset, but since the paper doesn't explicitly list them, I might infer that the dataset is created by the organizers of the FinTOC-2020 task. The description should include the details from the paper: 52 English and 47 French documents, annotations for titles and their depths, and the challenges in document structure. The title is "FinTOC-2020 Dataset." The issued year is 2020. The language is both English and French. The format is PDF documents. The themes are financial document analysis and structure extraction. Keywords include financial documents, table of contents, title detection, etc. The tasks are title detection and TOC generation.

I need to structure this into the required JSON format, ensuring all fields are filled appropriately based on the information extracted.
