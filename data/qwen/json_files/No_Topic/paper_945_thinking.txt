Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper focuses on building Catalan-English MT resources, emphasizing quality over quantity. They mention compiling existing resources and creating a new high-quality corpus. They also provide new evaluation datasets in three domains.

Looking at the sections, Section 3 details the compiled parallel corpora, including datasets like CCAligned, WikiMatrix, Paracrawl, and others. They also introduce GEnCaTa, a new high-quality corpus. Section 4 discusses the human audit of these datasets. Section 5 talks about the filtering process and the use of GEnCaTa for training a classifier. Section 6 mentions evaluation datasets like Flores-101, Catalan United Nations test set, and WMT20 Biomedical Shared Task.

I'll list all the datasets mentioned:

1. CCAligned
2. WikiMatrix
3. Paracrawl
4. OPUS
5. GEnCaTa
6. CoVost ca-en
7. CoVost en-ca
8. Eubookshop
9. Europarl
10. Global Voices
11. Gnome
12. JW300
13. KDE4
14. Memories Lliures
15. Open Subtitles
16. Opus Books
17. QED
18. Tatoeba
19. Tedtalks
20. Ubuntu
21. Wikimedia
22. Flores-101
23. Catalan United Nations test set
24. WMT20 Biomedical Shared Task test set
25. CyberMT
26. TaCon
27. WMT13-ca

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata fields. I'll check the references for creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, languages, identifiers, themes, keywords, landing pages, versions, formats, and tasks.

Some datasets might not have all the information, so I'll leave those fields empty if not found. For example, many datasets don't have specific versions or landing pages mentioned.

I'll structure each dataset as a JSON object with the specified fields, ensuring consistency and accuracy based on the paper's descriptions.
