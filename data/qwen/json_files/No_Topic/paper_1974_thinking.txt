Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about using BERT and ensembling for COVID-19 tweet identification tasks. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper mentions two datasets: DeepADEMiner and another stance detection dataset from Davydova and Tutubalina. 

For each dataset, I need to extract specific metadata fields. Let's start with DeepADEMiner. The paper says it's Version 2 from Magge et al. (2021b). So, the creators would be the authors of that reference, which I assume are Arjun Magge, Elena Tutubalina, Zulfat Miftahutdinov, Ilseyar Alimova, Anne Dirkson, Suzan Verberne, Davy Weissenbacher, and Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez. The description should reflect that it's used for pharmacovigilance tasks, specifically ADE classification. The title is "DeepADEMiner Dataset Version 2". The issued year is 2021. The language is English since it's about tweets. The identifier is empty as there's no DOI or URL provided. The theme is Health and Pharmacovigilance. Keywords include COVID-19, tweets, adverse drug events, and classification. The landing page is empty. The version is 2. The format is text. The task is ADE classification.

Next, the stance detection dataset from Davydova and Tutubalina (2022). The creators are Vera Davydova and Elena Tutubalina. The description is about tweets related to health mandates. The title is "SMM4H 2022 Stance Detection Dataset". The issued year is 2022. Language is English. Identifier is empty. Theme is Health and Public Sentiment. Keywords include stance detection, health mandates, and COVID-19. Landing page is empty. Version is empty. Format is text. Task is stance detection.

I need to make sure I'm not including any other information from the paper, just the datasets. Also, I should format this into JSON as specified, without any extra text.
