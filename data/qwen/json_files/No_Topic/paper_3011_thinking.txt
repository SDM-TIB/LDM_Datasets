Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, the paper's title is "Facial Expression Recognition by De-expression Residue Learning" by Huiyuan Yang, Umur Ciftci, and Lijun Yin. The abstract mentions that seven public facial expression databases are employed in their experiments. Specifically, they mention BU-4DFE and BP4D-spontaneous for pre-training, and evaluate on CK+, Oulu-CASIA, MMI, BU-3DFE, and BP4D+.

Looking through the paper, the datasets are listed in the abstract and further detailed in the experiments section. Each dataset is used for either pre-training or evaluation. I need to extract each of these datasets and provide their metadata.

For each dataset, I'll need to determine the creator, description, title, issued year, language, identifier, theme, keyword, landing page, version, format, and task. 

Starting with BU-4DFE: It's a 3D facial expression database. The creators are Yin et al., published in 2008. It contains 60,600 images from 101 subjects. The format is image, and the task is facial expression recognition.

Next, BP4D-spontaneous: This is a spontaneous expression database. Created by Zhang et al., published in 2014. It's a multimodal dataset with 2D, 3D, thermal, and physiological data. The format is image, and the task is facial expression recognition.

CK+ is a well-known dataset with 593 video sequences from 123 subjects. Created by Lucey et al., published in 2010. The format is video, and the task is facial expression recognition.

Oulu-CASIA is a dataset with 480 video sequences from 80 subjects under different illumination conditions. Created by Zhao et al., published in 2011. The format is video, and the task is facial expression recognition.

MMI is a dataset with 236 video sequences from 31 subjects. Created by Pantic et al., published in 2005. The format is video, and the task is facial expression recognition.

BU-3DFE is a 3D dataset with 2,500 pairs of static 3D face models and texture images from 100 subjects. Created by Yin et al., published in 2006. The format is image, and the task is facial expression recognition.

BP4D+ is an extension of BP4D, focusing on spontaneous expressions. Created by Zhang et al., published in 2016. The format is image, and the task is facial expression recognition.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring accuracy based on the paper's descriptions and references.
