Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is titled "LRE Map, a Song of Resources and Evaluation" by Riccardo Del Gratta and others. It's about the LRE Map, which is a tool for documenting and analyzing language resources used in conferences like LREC and COLING.

First, I need to understand what the LRE Map is. From the abstract, it's described as a tool introduced at LREC 2010 to monitor and represent the wealth of data and technologies in the field of NLP. It collects metadata about language resources, such as corpora, lexicons, tools, etc., from conference submissions.

The paper mentions that the LRE Map contains data from 17 different conferences, including LREC, COLING, INTERSPEECH, and others. The metadata collected includes Resource Type, Name, Production Status, Use, Language, Modality, Availability, Size, License, Documentation, URL, and Description. The authors analyzed this data to understand trends in the use and creation of language resources over time.

Now, I need to identify datasets mentioned in this paper. The main dataset discussed is the LRE Map itself, which is a collection of metadata about various language resources. However, the paper doesn't reference other datasets beyond the LRE Map. It discusses the structure and analysis of the data collected through the LRE Map but doesn't mention specific datasets like corpora or tools beyond their categorization within the LRE Map.

Therefore, the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper is the LRE Map. It's a comprehensive dataset of language resources, but it's not a traditional dataset in the sense of raw data or specific collections of text, audio, etc. Instead, it's a metadata repository that aggregates information about various language resources used in NLP research.

In summary, the paper focuses on the LRE Map as a tool and dataset for tracking and analyzing language resources, but it doesn't reference other specific datasets beyond their inclusion in the LRE Map's metadata.
