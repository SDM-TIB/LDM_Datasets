Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions using BERT for masked word prediction but doesn't specify a dataset. The introduction discusses BERT and its applications but doesn't reference any specific datasets yet.

Moving on to the "Experimental Setup" section, I find a mention of the STREUSLE 4.4 corpus. This seems to be the primary dataset used in the study. The paper describes it as a corpus of web reviews with rich annotations, including multiword expressions.

Next, I check the references section to find more details about STREUSLE. The references point to works by Schneider et al. (2018) and Schneider and Smith (2015), which are the sources of the STREUSLE corpus.

I also scan the rest of the paper for any other datasets. The paper focuses on BERT and its layers, using STREUSLE for their experiments. No other datasets are mentioned beyond this.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for STREUSLE based on the information provided. The creators are identified from the references, the description is taken from how the paper uses it, and other fields like language, format, and tasks are filled in accordingly.

I ensure that all fields are correctly populated, especially noting that the dataset is in English and is used for linguistic analysis tasks. Since no specific version is mentioned beyond 4.4, I include that as the version.

Finally, I compile all this information into the required JSON format, making sure to follow the specified metadata vocabulary and structure.
