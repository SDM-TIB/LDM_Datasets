Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about Native Language Identification using Phonetic Algorithms. Let me go through it step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract to get an overview. It mentions the NLI Shared Task 2017 and the TOEFL11 corpus. So, that's one dataset: TOEFL11.

Next, I'll look through the introduction. It talks about the NLI task and mentions the TOEFL11 corpus again. No new datasets here.

Moving on to the related work section. It references the 2013 BEA workshop and the TOEFL11 corpus. Still, only TOEFL11 is mentioned.

In the data section, the paper details the 2017 shared task data, which includes essays from 11 L1s. This is the same as the TOEFL11 corpus but with additional speech transcripts and i-vectors. So, the dataset is still TOEFL11, but with more data.

The methods section discusses phonetic algorithms like Soundex, Double Metaphone, NYSIIS, and the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary. These are tools used on the dataset, not datasets themselves.

The results and discussion sections don't mention any new datasets. They focus on the performance of different features.

Looking at the references, the paper cites several works, but the only dataset mentioned is the TOEFL11 corpus.

So, the only dataset mentioned in the paper is the TOEFL11 corpus. It's used for the NLI task, consists of essays from 11 languages, and includes speech data in 2017. The creators are from the NLI Shared Task, and it's in English. The format is text, and the task is Native Language Identification.
