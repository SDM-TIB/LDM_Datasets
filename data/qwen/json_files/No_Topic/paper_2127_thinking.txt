Alright, I'm trying to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about multilingual auxiliary tasks for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer of hate speech detection models. It's an anonymous submission to ACL, so I don't have the authors' names, but I can look for datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I'll go through the paper section by section to identify any datasets. The abstract mentions datasets used for hate speech detection, but it doesn't name them specifically. Moving to the introduction, the authors reference several studies and datasets, including:

1. **Hateval**: This is mentioned in the context of hate speech detection. It's a dataset used in previous work.
2. **HaSpeeDe**: Another dataset used for hate speech detection, likely from EVALITA.
3. **SemEval 2017**: This is a sentiment analysis task dataset.
4. **Intertass 2017**: Another dataset, possibly related to sentiment analysis.
5. **SentipolC 2016**: A Spanish sentiment analysis dataset.

In the datasets overview section (Appendix A), the paper lists several datasets:

- **Hate speech datasets**: These include datasets for immigrants and women in English, Italian, and Spanish.
- **Sentiment analysis datasets**: These are from Twitter in English, Italian, and Spanish.
- **Universal Dependencies (UD) datasets**: These include treebanks for English, Spanish, and Italian.
- **NER WikiANN dataset**: A multilingual named entity recognition dataset.
- **WNUT 2016 NER dataset**: A Twitter-based NER dataset.

Each of these datasets is used for different tasks in the paper, such as hate speech detection, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. I'll need to extract each of these datasets, gather their metadata, and structure them in JSON format as per the specified vocabulary.

I'll start by identifying the creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, languages, identifiers, themes, keywords, landing pages, versions, formats, and tasks for each dataset. If some information isn't explicitly provided, I'll make educated guesses based on the context or leave fields empty if unsure.

For example, the Hateval dataset is likely created by the authors of the Hateval challenge, but since the paper doesn't specify, I'll note it as unknown. Similarly, the SemEval 2017 dataset is created by Rosenthal et al., as referenced in the paper.

I'll ensure that each dataset is accurately described based on how it's used in the paper, including its purpose and the languages it covers. I'll also include the URLs or DOIs if they're provided, which they are for some datasets like SemEval and WNUT.

Finally, I'll compile all this information into a JSON array, making sure each dataset entry is correctly formatted and includes all the necessary metadata fields.
