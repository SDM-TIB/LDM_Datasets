Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract to get an overview. It talks about reducing infrequent-token perplexity using variational corpora. They mention using Jane Austen's complete works as a corpus. So, that's one dataset: Jane Austen's works.

Next, I'll look through the introduction. They reference the Brown corpus, which is a well-known dataset in linguistics. They also mention the Brown corpus again when discussing hapax legomena. So, Brown corpus is another dataset.

In the methodology section, they talk about using a pre-training corpus W, which is larger than the target corpus X. They mention using Jane Austen's complete works as X and her contemporaries' novels as W. So, the pre-training corpus includes works from Dickens and the Bronte sisters, which are part of the same dataset as Jane Austen's works.

They also mention using WordNet for synonym and hyponym extraction. WordNet is another dataset, but it's more of a lexical resource rather than a corpus. However, since it's mentioned, I should include it.

In the experiments section, they use Pinterest captions, which is another dataset. They applied their model to locate URLs in these captions.

So, the datasets I've identified are:
1. Jane Austen's complete works
2. Brown corpus
3. WordNet
4. Pinterest captions

Now, I'll extract the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
