Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe them using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses shape from shading, using a discriminative learning approach with regression forests. It mentions datasets used for training and evaluation.

In the "4. Data for Analysis and Training" section, the authors describe their dataset of 100 artist-created 3D models. This dataset is used for training and analysis. They also reference other datasets like the MIT Intrinsic Image Dataset and synthetic data from previous works.

Looking further, in the "8. Experiments" section, they mention the MIT Intrinsic Image Dataset, the dataset from Xiong et al. (2014), and their own real-world dataset captured using multi-view stereo.

I'll list each dataset, extract the relevant metadata, and structure them in JSON format as required.
