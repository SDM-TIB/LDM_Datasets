Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Automatic Classification of Communicative Functions of Deiniteness" by Archna Bhatia and others. It discusses the classification of communicative functions of deiniteness in English NPs using a supervised classifier. 

In the abstract, they mention using a corpus developed in prior work, specifically referencing Bhatia et al. (2014). This suggests that the dataset is from that prior work.

Looking at the introduction, they mention the CFD (Communicative Functions of Deiniteness) annotation scheme and the corpus developed in Bhatia et al. (2014). They also refer to the English deiniteness corpus, which is the same as the one from Bhatia et al. (2014).

In the data section (Section 3), they explicitly state that they use the English deiniteness corpus of Bhatia et al. (2014). This corpus consists of texts from multiple genres annotated with the CFD scheme. The data includes 17 documents across genres like TED talks, news articles, and fictional narratives, totaling 3,422 NPs.

They also mention that the data can be obtained from a specific URL: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ytsvetko/definiteness_corpus. This URL is the landing page for the dataset.

The dataset is in English, as it's an English deiniteness corpus. The format is text, as it's a corpus of annotated texts. The tasks it's used for include supervised classification of communicative functions of deiniteness.

So, the dataset mentioned is the English Deiniteness Corpus from Bhatia et al. (2014). The creators are the authors of that prior work, which includes Archna Bhatia, Mandy Simons, Lori Levin, Yulia Tsvetkov, Chris Dyer, and Jordan Bender. The description is based on how the paper uses it for classification tasks. The title is the English Deiniteness Corpus. It was issued in 2014. The language is English. The identifier is the URL provided. The theme is computational linguistics and deiniteness. The keywords include deiniteness, communicative functions, and corpus. The landing page is the URL. There's no specific version mentioned. The format is text. The tasks include supervised classification.

I need to structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring all metadata fields are correctly filled based on the dataset's description and usage in the paper.
