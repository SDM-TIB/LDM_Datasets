Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about semantic relation extraction from a cultural database. Let me go through it step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract. It mentions that they used a cultural database derived from the Thai Cultural Information Center website. So, that's one dataset: the Thai Cultural Information Center database.

Next, I'll look through the introduction. They mention that the cultural database has grown to around 80,000 records. This confirms that the dataset is the Thai Cultural Information Center database.

In the methods section, they talk about using Apache Solr for indexing and searching the database. They also mention using a character cluster generator and a morphological analyzer. However, these are tools, not datasets.

They reference the ORCHID corpus and the TCLas lexicon for word boundaries and POS tags. ORCHID is a Thai corpus used for part-of-speech tagging, so that's another dataset.

They also mention the Thai-Nest framework for named entity tagging, which is another dataset or resource, but it's more of a tool than a dataset.

In the references, they cite several works, including the ORCHID corpus and the Thai-Nest framework. These are additional datasets used in their research.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. Thai Cultural Information Center database
2. ORCHID corpus
3. Thai-Nest framework

I'll need to extract metadata for each of these datasets based on the information provided in the paper.
