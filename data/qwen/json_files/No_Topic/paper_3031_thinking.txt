Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Name-aware Machine Translation" and is authored by Haibo Li, Jing Zheng, Heng Ji, Qi Li, and Wen Wang. It discusses a novel approach to integrating name processing into machine translation systems.

Looking through the sections, I find that the authors mention several datasets and resources:

1. **Chinese-English Parallel Treebank**: This is mentioned in the context of word alignment experiments. It's a resource used for evaluating word alignment accuracy.

2. **ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) data**: Referenced in the context of Chinese name tagging performance comparison. It's a dataset used for evaluating named entity recognition systems.

3. **BOLT (Broad Operational Language Translation) corpus**: The authors used this corpus for training their MT system. It's a large dataset containing various genres of text.

4. **NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) MT evaluations**: These are datasets used for evaluating machine translation systems, particularly in the context of government evaluations.

5. **GALE (Global Autonomous Language Exploitation) program**: Another dataset used for training, focusing on broadcast news and conversations.

6. **TIDES (Translingual Information Detection, Extraction, and Summarization) program**: A dataset used for training, likely containing various types of text for MT purposes.

7. **DARPA's BOLT Phase 1 data**: This includes discussion forums and other text genres used for training the MT system.

8. **English Gigaword Fifth Edition**: A monolingual corpus used for training language models.

9. **Quick transcripts and rich transcripts from LDC**: These are audio-derived transcripts used for training language models.

10. **Chinese-English Parallel Treebank (Li et al., 2010)**: Specifically mentioned for word alignment experiments.

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields based on the information provided in the paper.
