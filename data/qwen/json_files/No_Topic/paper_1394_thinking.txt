Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "An Assessment of the Accuracy of Automatic Evaluation in Summarization" by Karolina Owczarzak and others. It discusses the use of automatic evaluation metrics like ROUGE for summarization tasks, specifically using data from the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) organized by NIST.

Looking through the paper, I see references to the TAC 2008-2011 Summarization Track. This dataset is used to evaluate the performance of summarization systems. The paper mentions that the data includes summaries produced by both human and automatic systems, along with manual evaluations using Pyramid and Responsiveness metrics.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The focus is on the TAC datasets from these years, which are used to assess the accuracy of automatic evaluation methods.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for the TAC 2008-2011 Summarization Track dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
