Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about comparative graph-based summarization of scientific papers guided by comparative citations. The authors built a dataset called CSSC (Comparative Scientific Summarization Corpus) and used DUC2006 and DUC2007 datasets for experiments.

First, I'll look for mentions of datasets. The CSSC dataset is described in detail. It's created by the authors, so the creators are Jingqiang Chen, Chaoxiang Cai, Xiaorui Jiang, and Kejia Chen. The description mentions it's built from 32 papers in AI, with 40 comparative citations. The language is English, and it's used for summarization tasks.

Next, DUC2006 and DUC2007 are mentioned. These are standard datasets for summarization tasks. They were created by NIST, so the creators are listed as such. The descriptions note they're used for evaluating summarization methods, with domains like news and scientific papers. The tasks involve multi-document summarization.

I need to structure each dataset with the required metadata. For CSSC, the title is "Comparative Scientific Summarization Corpus (CSSC)", creators are the authors, description as per the paper, issued year 2022, language English, format text, themes like NLP and summarization, keywords including scientific papers and comparative summaries.

For DUC2006 and DUC2007, titles are straightforward. Creators are NIST. Descriptions mention their use in summarization evaluations. Issued years are 2006 and 2007. Themes include NLP and text summarization. Keywords focus on multi-document summarization.

I'll ensure each dataset entry is accurate, capturing all necessary details from the paper. No additional datasets are mentioned, so only these three are included.
