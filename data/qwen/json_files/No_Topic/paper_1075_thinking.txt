Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions the task of emotion inference in multi-turn conversations and refers to three benchmark datasets: IEMOCAP, MELD, and EmoryNLP. These are likely the datasets used in the study.

Next, I'll check the methodology section to see if these datasets are described in more detail. The paper mentions that experiments were conducted on these three datasets, which are standard benchmarks for emotion recognition in conversations.

Looking at the references section, I can find more details about each dataset:

1. **IEMOCAP**: Cited as Busso et al., 2008. It's an interactive emotional dyadic motion capture database.
2. **MELD**: Cited as Poria et al., 2019. It's a multimodal, multi-party dataset for emotion recognition.
3. **EmoryNLP**: Cited as Zahir et al., 2018. It's used for emotion detection in TV show transcripts.

Now, I'll gather the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper and the references.

For each dataset, I'll extract the creator(s), description, title, publication year, language (if applicable), identifier (DOI or URL if available), theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and the tasks they're used for.

Since the paper doesn't provide DOIs or URLs for these datasets, I'll leave those fields empty. The themes and keywords are based on the context in which the datasets are used in the paper.

Finally, I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately represented with the appropriate metadata.
