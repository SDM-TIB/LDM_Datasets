Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction. The abstract mentions two datasets: FFHQ and CelebA-HQ. These are face datasets used in the study. 

Next, I'll check the introduction and other sections for any additional datasets. The paper discusses experiments using these two datasets, FFHQ and CelebA-HQ, and mentions pre-trained GAN models like StyleGAN and PGGAN. However, the datasets themselves are FFHQ and CelebA-HQ.

Now, I'll look for any references or citations related to these datasets. The paper cites Karras et al., 2017 and 2019 for these datasets. 

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata fields:
- **dcterms:creator**: The authors from the dataset's reference.
- **dcterms:description**: A brief description based on how the paper uses the dataset.
- **dcterms:title**: The name of the dataset.
- **dcterms:issued**: The year the dataset was published.
- **dcterms:language**: Not applicable for image datasets.
- **dcterms:identifier**: DOI or URL if available.
- **dcat:theme**: Thematic categories like Computer Vision, Faces.
- **dcat:keyword**: Relevant keywords.
- **dcat:landingPage**: URL if available.
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Not mentioned.
- **dcterms:format**: Image.
- **mls:task**: Tasks like face generation, attribute manipulation.

I'll structure this information into JSON format for each dataset.
