Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is titled "Can the Transformer Learn Nested Recursion with Symbol Masking?" and it's authored by Jean-Philippe Bernardy, Adam Ek, and Vladislav Maraev from the University of Gothenburg. 

First, I'll read through the abstract to get a sense of what the paper is about. It seems they're investigating whether transformer models can learn nested structures, specifically using languages with nested parentheses. They mention using encoder-only models trained to predict randomly masked symbols in a BERT-like fashion. The experiments involve testing the model's ability to generalize to deeper nesting levels and longer distances between parentheses.

Next, I'll look into the Data Sets section (Section 2) to find any datasets mentioned. The authors define a language Dn, which is a context-free language involving nested parentheses. They generate strings using a random walk on a grid, ensuring that the model doesn't cross the diagonal, which corresponds to valid nested structures. They mention controlling the maximum distance and depth by discarding certain strings, creating distributions D[MaxDist=d] and D[MaxDepth=d]. 

They also mention that in all experiments, N is set to 10, which is enough to illustrate their points. The datasets are synthetic, generated for the purpose of testing the model's ability to handle nested recursion. 

I don't see any references to external datasets or citations to other works where datasets are used. The datasets are internally generated within the paper's experiments. 

So, the datasets mentioned are synthetic and created specifically for this study. They don't reference any external datasets, so there are no creators other than the authors of the paper. The description of the datasets is based on the context-free language with nested parentheses, generated using a random walk method. 

I'll structure the JSON response accordingly, noting that the datasets are synthetic, created by the authors, and describe their characteristics as per the paper.
