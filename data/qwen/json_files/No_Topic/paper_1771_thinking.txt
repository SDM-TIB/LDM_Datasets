Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Deep Supervised Hashing with Anchor Graph" by Yudong Chen and others. It discusses deep hashing methods for image retrieval. In the experiments section, the authors mention three datasets: CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, and NUS-WIDE.

First, I'll look for details about each dataset. CIFAR-10 is a well-known dataset of images divided into 10 classes. The paper uses it for training and testing, with specific splits mentioned. Fashion-MNIST is another dataset, similar to MNIST but with fashion items, also split into training and testing sets. NUS-WIDE is a multi-label dataset used for cross-modal retrieval, focusing on 21 classes.

Next, I'll gather metadata for each dataset. For CIFAR-10, the creators are Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. It's described as a collection of labeled images. The title is "CIFAR-10", published in 2009. It's in English, has no specific identifier mentioned, the theme is computer vision, keywords include image classification, and it's used for tasks like image retrieval.

Fashion-MNIST was created by Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. It's a dataset of fashion items, described similarly to MNIST. Published in 2017, it's in English, with themes in computer vision and keywords like clothing classification. Tasks include image retrieval.

NUS-WIDE's creators are Tat-Seng Chua, Jinhui Tang, Richang Hong, Hengjian He, Kaiyong Li, and Xian Wu. It's a multi-label dataset for cross-modal retrieval, published in 2011. Themes include computer vision and multi-label classification, with keywords like image-text retrieval. Tasks involve cross-modal retrieval.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring all information is accurate based on the paper's description.
