Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction. The abstract mentions "TheSoz multilingual thesaurus" and "EuroVoc and AGROVOC thesauri." These seem like datasets used in the experiments.

Moving to the introduction, the paper discusses RDF datasets and mentions DBpedia and XLore. DBpedia is a well-known dataset, and XLore is another RDF dataset, so these are additional datasets.

In the related work section, the authors reference several thesauri: EARTh, GEMET, AGROVOC, EUNIS, GBA, and EuroVoc. These are all datasets used in the context of multilingual vocabularies.

The evaluation section details two experiments. The first uses TheSoz, and the second uses EuroVoc and AGROVOC. This confirms these datasets are central to the paper.

Now, I'll compile the metadata for each dataset:

1. **TheSoz**: Created by GESIS, it's a multilingual thesaurus in English, French, and German. It's used for interlinking concepts. The paper references it as version 0.93 from 2013.

2. **EuroVoc**: A multilingual thesaurus in 23 languages, covering EU activities. It's cited from 2013.

3. **AGROVOC**: A multilingual agricultural thesaurus, cited from 2014.

4. **DBpedia**: A large dataset extracting structured information from Wikipedia, cited from 2009.

5. **XLore**: A Chinese knowledge base, cited from 2013.

6. **EARTh**: An environmental thesaurus, cited from 2014.

7. **GEMET**: An environmental thesaurus, cited from 2014.

8. **EUNIS**: A biodiversity thesaurus, cited from 2014.

9. **GBA**: A bilingual geodata thesaurus, cited from 2014.

Each dataset's metadata is extracted based on the paper's description, including creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, languages, themes, keywords, and landing pages where available.
