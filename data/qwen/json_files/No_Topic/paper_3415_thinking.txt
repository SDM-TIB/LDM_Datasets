Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let's start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, I'll look through the abstract and introduction. The abstract mentions tasks like paraphrase identification, natural language inference, and answer sentence selection. It also references datasets such as Quora Question Pairs, SNLI, MultiNLI, and SQuAD. These are the primary datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I'll examine the sections where experiments are described. In the "Experiment" section, the paper details experiments conducted on three tasks using four standard benchmark datasets: Quora Question Pairs, SNLI, MultiNLI, and SQuAD. Each of these datasets is used for different tasks, such as paraphrase identification, natural language inference, and answer sentence selection.

I'll now gather information about each dataset:

1. **Quora Question Pairs**: This dataset is used for paraphrase identification. It contains over 400,000 question pairs, each labeled as paraphrase or not. The paper splits this dataset into training, development, and test sets.

2. **SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is used for natural language inference. It contains sentence pairs labeled with entailment, contradiction, or neutral. The paper uses it for evaluating the model's performance in understanding sentence relationships.

3. **MultiNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is similar to SNLI but includes a broader range of genres. It's used for both matched and mismatched test examples to evaluate the model's generalization ability.

4. **SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)**: This dataset is used for answer sentence selection. It contains question-answer pairs, and the paper evaluates the model's ability to select the correct answer sentence from a passage.

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata fields:

- **dcterms:creator**: The authors or creators of the dataset as mentioned in the paper's references.
- **dcterms:description**: A brief description based on how the dataset is used in the paper.
- **dcterms:title**: The name of the dataset.
- **dcterms:issued**: The year the dataset was published, if available.
- **dcterms:language**: The language of the dataset content.
- **dcterms:identifier**: A unique identifier like a DOI or URL if provided.
- **dcat:theme**: Thematic categories relevant to the dataset.
- **dcat:keyword**: Keywords describing the dataset.
- **dcat:landingPage**: A URL providing access to the dataset.
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Specific version if mentioned.
- **dcterms:format**: The format of the dataset (e.g., text, image).
- **mls:task**: The tasks for which the dataset is used.

I'll ensure that each dataset is accurately described based on the information provided in the paper and its references.
