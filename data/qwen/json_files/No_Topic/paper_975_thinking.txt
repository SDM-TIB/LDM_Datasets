Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about the MeasEval task, which focuses on extracting counts, measurements, and their related contexts from scientific documents. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the MeasEval task, but that's the task itself, not a dataset. 

Looking at the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of measurements in scientific discourse. They reference previous work, such as Foppiano et al. (2019a), but those are papers, not datasets. 

In the Related Work section, they mention ontologies like QUDT and OM, but those are frameworks, not datasets. They also reference databases like LITTERBASE, NeuroElectro, and ZFIN, which are knowledge bases but not datasets in the traditional sense. 

The Corpus and Annotations section is crucial. The authors mention that the MeasEval dataset is built from 110 CC-BY licensed articles from Elsevier Labs. These articles were used in a previous SemEval task in 2017. The dataset includes 428 paragraphs with 1663 quantities, split into training and evaluation sets. 

So, the main dataset here is the MeasEval dataset. It's created by the authors of the paper, so the creators are the same as the paper's authors. The description is about extracting measurements and their contexts. The title is "MeasEval Dataset." It was issued in 2021, as that's when the paper was published. The language is English since the articles are in English. The identifier is the GitHub repository link provided. The themes are scientific measurements and knowledge graphs. Keywords include measurements, entities, properties, and contexts. The landing page is the GitHub link. The format is text, and the task is measurement extraction.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The references to other works or databases are not datasets used in this paper but rather related resources.
