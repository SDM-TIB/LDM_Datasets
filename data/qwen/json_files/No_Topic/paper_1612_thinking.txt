Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Proposition methodologique pour la detection automatique de Community Manager. Etude multilingue sur un corpus relatif Ã  la Junk Food" by Johan Ferguth and others. It discusses a methodology for automatically detecting Community Managers in internet forums, focusing on the fast-food industry. The study uses a multilingual corpus.

Looking through the paper, I see that they mention four corpora: French, English, Chinese, and Russian. These are used for their study on detecting Community Manager messages. The paper provides details on the size and composition of each corpus, including the number of messages and words.

For each dataset, I need to extract the metadata fields as specified. Let's go through each corpus:

1. **French Corpus**: The paper mentions it's used for detailed methodology description. It has 61,205 words, with 249 non-suspect messages and 61 suspect messages. The language is French, and it's used for text analysis tasks like classification.

2. **English Corpus**: It has 32,588 words, with 251 non-suspect messages and 25 suspect messages. The language is English, and it's used similarly for classification tasks.

3. **Chinese Corpus**: This corpus has 8,051 words, with 516 non-suspect messages and 184 suspect messages. The language is Chinese, and it's used for the same classification tasks.

4. **Russian Corpus**: Although mentioned, the results were insufficient, so it's not detailed further. However, it's still a dataset used in the study.

Each dataset's description includes the language, the number of messages, and the context of their use in the study. The tasks involve classification of messages as suspect or non-suspect, which relates to text analysis and sentiment detection.

Now, I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is properly described with the relevant metadata fields.
