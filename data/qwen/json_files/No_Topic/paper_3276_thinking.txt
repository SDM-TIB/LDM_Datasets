Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses a contour-constrained superpixel algorithm and its applications. It mentions datasets used for evaluation, such as the BSDS500 dataset and the SegTrack dataset.

Next, I'll look into the sections where experiments and evaluations are described. In Section 5.1, the authors evaluate their algorithm on the BSDS500 dataset, which is a standard dataset for image segmentation tasks. They also mention the LIBSVX 3.0 benchmark, which is used for temporal superpixel evaluation.

In Section 5.2, the SegTrack dataset is referenced for evaluating temporal superpixels. Additionally, the paper mentions the NTT dataset in the context of saliency detection applications.

I'll also check the references section to find more details about these datasets. The BSDS500 dataset is cited as Martin et al., 2001, and the SegTrack dataset is cited as Tsai et al., 2010. The LIBSVX 3.0 benchmark is cited as Xu and Corso, 2012, and the NTT dataset is cited as Akamine et al., 2012.

Now, I'll compile the metadata for each dataset based on the information found in the paper and its references.
