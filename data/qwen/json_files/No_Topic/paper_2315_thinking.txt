Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about Chinese shape classifiers and their metaphorical extensions, and it's authored by Francesca Quattri. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the study is based on a selection of classifiers derived from extensive literature, but it doesn't specify any datasets. 

Looking at the introduction, the authors reference previous work by Mok, Huini, Bond, Paik, and others, but these are just citations of studies, not datasets. 

In the second section, the authors discuss classifiers and their functions. They mention the SUMO ontology (www.ontologyupperontologyportal.com) but that's more of a knowledge base than a dataset. They also reference the Chinese-English dictionary CEDICT (http://cdict.net/), which is a dataset. 

Further down, they mention Hantology (http://hantology.sinica.edu.tw/), which is another dataset. 

In the references, they cite several studies, but none of these are datasets. The key datasets identified are CEDICT and Hantology. 

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided. For CEDICT, it's a Chinese-English dictionary, so the creator is the CEDICT project, the title is CEDICT, the description is about the dictionary, the landing page is the URL, and the language is Chinese and English. 

For Hantology, it's a database of Chinese characters, created by Chou and Huang, with a landing page URL and language as Chinese. 

I'll format this information into the required JSON structure, ensuring all fields are filled appropriately based on the paper's content.
