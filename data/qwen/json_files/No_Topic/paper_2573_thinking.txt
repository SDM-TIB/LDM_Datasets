Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Distributed Representations of Words and Documents for Discriminating Similar Languages" by Marc Franco-Salvador, Paolo Rosso, and Francisco Rangel. It discusses language identification tasks, particularly focusing on similar languages and varieties.

In the abstract, they mention the DSL (Discriminating Similar Languages) 2015 shared task. This suggests that the DSL dataset is a key dataset used in their work.

Looking further into the introduction, they reference the HispaBlogs dataset. This dataset is described as a collection of Spanish blogs from five different countries: Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Spain. It's mentioned in the context of their previous work and is used for evaluating language variety identification.

In the methodology section, they detail their approach using the DSL Corpus Collection (DSLCC v.2.0). This dataset includes sentences in various languages and language groups, such as Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Czech, Slovak, Argentinian Spanish, Peninsular Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, Malay, and Indonesian. The dataset is divided into training, development, and test sets, with specific numbers of sentences per language.

Additionally, they mention the use of the word2vec toolkit for training distributed representations, but this is a tool, not a dataset.

To summarize, the datasets mentioned are:
1. DSL Corpus Collection (DSLCC v.2.0)
2. HispaBlogs dataset

Now, I'll extract the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
