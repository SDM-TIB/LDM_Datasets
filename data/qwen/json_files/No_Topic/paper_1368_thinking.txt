Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses LEXFIT, a method for lexical fine-tuning of pretrained language models. It mentions using external lexical resources like WordNet and the Paraphrase Database (PPDB). These are likely datasets.

In the methodology section, the authors reference WordNet and PPDB again, confirming their use as datasets. They also mention using fastText embeddings, which are based on Wikipedia data, so that's another dataset.

Looking further, the evaluation section mentions several benchmarks: Multi-SimLex, SimVerb-3500, SimLex-999, and others. These are all datasets used for evaluating lexical semantic similarity.

Additionally, the authors use BERT models pretrained on Wikipedia data, which is another dataset source.

I'll list each dataset, extract the required metadata, and format them into JSON as specified.
