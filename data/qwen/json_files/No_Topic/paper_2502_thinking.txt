Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "DIVERSITY AUGMENTED CONDITIONAL GENERATIVE ADVERSARIALENHANCED NETWORK MULTIMODAL IMAGE-TO-IMAGE TRANSLATION FOR" and is authored by anonymous authors. It's under review for ICLR 2021.

Looking through the introduction and related work sections, I notice several datasets mentioned in the context of experiments and evaluations. 

First, the paper mentions the "catdog" dataset, which is commonly used for image-to-image translation tasks. It's often cited in works related to GANs and image translation.

Next, the "summerwinter" dataset is referenced. This dataset is typically used for seasonal image translation, where the goal is to translate images from one season to another, like summer to winter.

The "alps seasonal transfer" dataset is also mentioned. This seems to be another dataset focused on seasonal changes, possibly similar to summerwinter but specific to the Alps region.

The "image weather condition" dataset is referenced as well. This dataset likely contains images under different weather conditions, used to test the model's ability to translate images across various weather scenarios.

The "AFHQ" dataset is another one mentioned. AFHQ stands for "Animal Faces in the Wild," and it's a dataset used for generating high-quality animal face images, often in GAN research.

Lastly, the "WikiArts" dataset is cited. WikiArts is a dataset containing fine art images, used for tasks like style transfer and image generation.

Now, I need to gather metadata for each of these datasets. However, the paper doesn't provide detailed information about each dataset's creators, descriptions, publication dates, etc. Since the paper only mentions these datasets in passing, I can't extract specific metadata beyond their names and the tasks they're used for.

Given the instructions, I'll format the datasets into JSON, including only the information available from the paper. Each dataset will have its title, and if possible, the task it's used for. Other fields like creator, description, etc., will be left empty as they're not provided in the paper.
