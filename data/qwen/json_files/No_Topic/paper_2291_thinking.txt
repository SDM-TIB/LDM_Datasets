Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract talks about Open Information Extraction (Open IE) for Spanish based on syntactic constraints. It mentions comparing their system, EXTRHECH, with REVERB on a parallel dataset. That's one dataset: the parallel English-Spanish dataset from the News Commentary Corpus.

Next, in the introduction, they discuss Open IE systems and their performance on various datasets. They mention using a dataset of grammatically correct sentences and another of random texts from the Web. These are two more datasets: the News Commentary Corpus and the Raw Web dataset.

Moving to the related work section, they reference several systems like TEXTRUNNER, WOEpos, WOEparse, FES-2012, DEPOE, and OLLIE. However, these are systems, not datasets, so I won't include them.

In the experiments section, they describe two main experiments. The first uses a parallel dataset of 300 sentences from the News Commentary Corpus. The second experiment uses a dataset of 159 sentences extracted from the CommonCrawl 2012 corpus. These are the same datasets mentioned earlier.

I also need to check the references for any additional datasets. The references include works by Banko, Etzioni, Fader, Gamallo, Padr√≥n, and others, but none of these are datasets used in the paper.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided:

1. **News Commentary Corpus (English-Spanish Parallel Dataset)**
   - Used for comparing EXTRHECH with REVERB.
   - Contains 300 parallel sentences.
   - Language: English and Spanish.
   - Themes: Text Processing, Machine Translation.
   - Keywords: Parallel corpus, News, Open IE.

2. **CommonCrawl 2012 Web Corpus**
   - Used for extracting random texts from the Web.
   - Contains 159 sentences after filtering.
   - Language: Spanish.
   - Themes: Web Text, Open IE.
   - Keywords: Web corpus, Random texts.

I'll ensure each dataset is described with the appropriate metadata fields as specified.
