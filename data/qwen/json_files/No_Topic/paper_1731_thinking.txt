Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses Flooding-X, a method to improve BERT's resistance to adversarial attacks. It mentions experiments on various NLP tasks and datasets. 

In the introduction, the authors reference several datasets used in their experiments. Specifically, they mention SST-2, MRPC, QNLI, IMDB, and AG News. These are standard datasets in NLP for tasks like sentiment analysis, paraphrase detection, question answering, and news classification.

Next, I'll check the sections where experiments are described. The authors detail their experiments on five datasets: SST-2, MRPC, QNLI, IMDB, and AG News. They provide statistics for each dataset, including the number of training and test samples and average word counts.

Now, I need to gather metadata for each dataset. The creators are the authors who originally published each dataset. For example, SST-2 was created by Socher et al., MRPC by Dolan and Brockett, QNLI by Rajpurkar et al., IMDB by Maas et al., and AG News by Zhang et al.

Descriptions for each dataset should reflect their purpose as mentioned in the paper. For instance, SST-2 is for sentiment analysis, MRPC for paraphrase detection, and so on.

The titles are straightforward, using the official names of each dataset. The issued years are taken from the references provided in the paper. All datasets are in English, so the language field is "English".

Since the paper doesn't provide DOIs or URLs for these datasets, the identifier and landingPage fields will be empty. The themes are based on the tasks each dataset is used for, such as sentiment analysis, paraphrase detection, etc.

Keywords are generated based on the dataset's purpose and usage in the paper. For example, SST-2 might have keywords like "sentiment analysis," "text classification," etc.

The format for all datasets is "Text" since they are all text-based. The tasks each dataset is used for are listed, such as "Sentiment Analysis" for SST-2 and "Question Answering" for QNLI.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring accuracy and completeness based on the information provided in the paper.
