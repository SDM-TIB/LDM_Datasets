Alright, I'm trying to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about self-supervised learning using video sequences to learn motion-informed representations. The authors used two main datasets: Objectron and UCF101. 

First, I'll look for mentions of datasets in the abstract and introduction. The abstract mentions Objectron and UCF101 as the datasets used for evaluation. 

In the introduction, the authors reference ImageNet, but that's more of a general dataset used in many vision tasks, not specific to this paper's experiments. 

Moving to the methodology section, the authors detail their use of Objectron and UCF101. Objectron is described as an object-centric dataset with videos and 3D bounding box annotations. UCF101 is an action recognition dataset with diverse human-centric videos.

I'll need to gather metadata for each dataset. For Objectron, the creators are listed in the references as Adel Ahmadyan, Liangkai Zhang, etc. The description is about object-centric videos with pose annotations. It was published in 2020. The format is video, and the tasks include pose estimation and re-identification.

For UCF101, the creators are Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah, published in 2012. It's a video dataset for action recognition, with a human-centric focus. The format is video, and the tasks include action recognition.

I'll structure this information into JSON format, ensuring each dataset has the required metadata fields.
