Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is titled "ReVal: A Simple and Effective Machine Translation Evaluation Metric Based on Recurrent Neural Networks" by Rohit Gupta, Constantin OrEasan, and Josef van Genabith. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions WMT-14 and WMT-13, which I recognize as part of the Workshop on Machine Translation. These are likely datasets used for evaluating machine translation systems.

Next, I'll look into the sections where datasets are discussed. In the introduction, the authors mention using WMT-13 and WMT-14 datasets for training and evaluation. They specifically talk about the WMT-13 human evaluation rankings and how they converted these into similarity scores for their model.

In the Methods section, the authors describe how they used the WMT-13 corpus to compute training data. They mention that this corpus is the largest among WMT workshops, containing a significant number of ranked translations. They also refer to the SICK dataset, which is used for evaluating semantic similarity, and combine it with their own data for training.

Looking at the Results section, the authors evaluate their approach on WMT-14 and WMT-12 datasets, showing how their model performs compared to other metrics. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their evaluation.

In the References, I find citations for WMT-13 and WMT-14, which confirm that these are standard datasets in machine translation evaluation. The SICK dataset is also cited, providing more details about its use in semantic similarity tasks.

Putting it all together, the datasets mentioned are WMT-13, WMT-14, and SICK. Each is used for different purposes: WMT-13 for training, WMT-14 and WMT-12 for evaluation, and SICK for enhancing semantic similarity assessment.

Now, I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset includes all the specified metadata fields based on the paper's description.
