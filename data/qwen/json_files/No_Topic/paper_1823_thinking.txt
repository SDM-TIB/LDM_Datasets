Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about building a monolingual word alignment corpus for the Greater China Region. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, the abstract mentions two datasets: a 11,623-triple GCR word dictionary corpus and a 12,000 sentence pairs GCR word alignment corpus. Both are derived from Wikipedia and news websites. So, these are the main datasets discussed.

Looking into the introduction, the authors talk about constructing these two corpora. The first is a word dictionary corpus with 11,623 triples, and the second is a word alignment corpus with 12,000 sentence pairs. They mention using Wikipedia and news websites as sources.

In Section 4, they describe the GCR word dictionary corpus. They generated initial triples using an algorithm and then manually annotated them. The final corpus has 11,623 triples. The data is in Chinese, specifically in simplified and traditional scripts.

Section 5 discusses the GCR word alignment corpus. They manually annotated 12,000 sentence pairs from Wikipedia and news websites. This corpus is used to evaluate their word alignment model.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors don't reference external datasets beyond their own constructed ones. They used Wikipedia and news data, but these aren't datasets per se but sources from which they built their corpora.

So, the two datasets are:

1. GCR Word Dictionary Corpus (11,623 triples)
2. GCR Word Alignment Corpus (12,000 sentence pairs)

Both are created by the authors for their research, so the creators are the authors of the paper. The description should reflect how they were built and used. The language is Chinese, and the format is text. The themes are computational linguistics and word alignment. The keywords include word alignment, corpus, Chinese, etc. The tasks involve word alignment and dictionary construction.

I need to structure this into JSON format with the specified metadata fields.
