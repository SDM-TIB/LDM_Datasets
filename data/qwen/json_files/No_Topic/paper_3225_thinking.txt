Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract talks about CHRF scores and their correlation with human rankings, but doesn't mention specific datasets. The introduction references previous work by Popović and Stanojević, but these are authors, not datasets.

Moving on to the methodology section, the paper discusses experiments using data from the WMT14 and WMT15 shared tasks. These are likely datasets. WMT stands for Workshop on Machine Translation, so these are standard datasets in machine translation research.

In the results section, the paper mentions experiments on three datasets with direct human scores. These include:
1. A dataset described in Specia et al., 2010, which is about post-editing effort.
2. An Irish SMT dataset rated for overall quality.
3. A Serbian SMT dataset rated for adequacy and fluency.

Additionally, the paper references the WMT14 and WMT15 datasets, which are used for evaluating machine translation systems across multiple languages.

I'll now compile the metadata for each of these datasets based on the information provided in the paper.
