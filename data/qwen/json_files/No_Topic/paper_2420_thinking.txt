Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) in low-resource settings, focusing on Somali, Swahili, and Tagalog documents retrieved by English queries. They mention using ASR and MT systems, but I'm looking for datasets.

In the Data section (5.1), they refer to the IARPA MATERIAL project's OpenCLIR Evaluation (2018). This seems like a dataset used for their experiments. It includes speech and text documents in Somali, Swahili, and Tagalog with English queries.

Looking further, in section 5.2, they mention using parallel corpora from the MATERIAL project, which includes news, topical, and blog texts. They also used crawled data and monolingual data for training MT systems. However, the primary dataset used for evaluation is the OpenCLIR Evaluation from the MATERIAL project.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned. The references include various works, but they don't point to additional datasets used in this paper.

So, the main dataset is from the OpenCLIR Evaluation, part of the IARPA MATERIAL project. It's used for testing CLIR performance with speech and text documents in low-resource languages.
