Alright, I'm looking at the provided paper text, which is the proceedings from the 4th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Code Switching (CALCS) at LREC 2020. My task is to extract all datasets mentioned in this paper and describe them using the specified metadata vocabulary.

First, I'll go through the paper to identify any datasets. The paper's table of contents lists several papers, each potentially mentioning datasets. I'll examine each paper's title and abstract to find dataset names.

1. **An Annotated Corpus of Emerging Anglicisms in Spanish Newspaper Headlines** by Elena Alvarez-Mellado. This paper mentions a corpus of Spanish newspaper headlines annotated for Anglicisms. The dataset is about code-switching between Spanish and English in formal genres.

2. **A New Dataset for Natural Language Inference from Code-mixed Conversations** by Simran Khanuja, Sandipan Dandapat, Sunayana Sitaram, and Monojit Choudhury. This dataset is for natural language inference tasks involving code-mixed conversations, likely in informal genres.

3. **When is Multi-task Learning Beneficial for Low-Resource Noisy Code-switched User-generated Algerian Texts?** by Waia Adouane and Jean-Philippe Bernardy. This paper uses a dataset of Algerian texts that code-switch between Arabic and French, focusing on low-resource scenarios.

4. **Evaluating Word Embeddings for Indonesian-English Code-Mixed Text Based on Synthetic Data** by ArraaDi Nur Rizal and Sara Stymne. This dataset involves synthetic data for evaluating word embeddings in Indonesian-English code-mixed texts.

5. **Understanding Script-Mixing: A Case Study of Hindi-English Bilingual Twitter Users** by Abhishek Srivastava, Kalika Bali, and Monojit Choudhury. This dataset consists of Twitter data from Hindi-English bilingual users, focusing on script-mixing.

6. **Sentiment Analysis for Hinglish Code-mixed Tweets by means of Cross-lingual Word Embeddings** by Pranaydeep Singh and Els Lefever. This dataset is about Hinglish (Hindi-English) code-mixed tweets used for sentiment analysis.

7. **Semi-supervised acoustic and language model training for English-isiZulu code-switched speech recognition** by Astik Biswas, Febe De Wet, Ewald Van der westhuizen, and Thomas Niesler. This dataset involves speech data for English-isiZulu code-switched speech recognition.

8. **Code-mixed parse trees and how to find them** by Anirudh Srinivasan, Sandipan Dandapat, and Monojit Choudhury. This dataset includes parse trees for code-mixed text, likely focusing on syntactic structures.

9. **Towards an Efficient Code-Mixed Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion in an Agglutinative Language: A Case Study on To-Korean Transliteration** by Won Ik Cho, Seok Min Kim, and Nam Soo Kim. This dataset is about transliteration between Korean and another language, focusing on grapheme-to-phoneme conversion.

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata fields. However, the paper doesn't provide detailed information like creators, publication dates, or URLs for each dataset. Therefore, I'll note that some fields might be empty or inferred based on the context provided.

Now, I'll structure each dataset into the JSON format as specified, ensuring that each field is appropriately filled based on the information available in the paper.
