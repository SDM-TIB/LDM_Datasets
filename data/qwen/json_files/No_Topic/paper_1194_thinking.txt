Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about a semantic parsing system called PERIN that participated in the CoNLL 2020 shared task, MRP 2020. The task involved parsing sentences into graph-structured meaning representations across different frameworks and languages.

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that PERIN was evaluated on five different frameworks: AMR, DRG, EDS, PTG, and UCCA across four languages. These frameworks are datasets themselves, each representing a specific type of meaning representation.

Looking further into the introduction, the paper details each framework:

1. **AMR (Abstract Meaning Representation)**: Mentioned as a framework with a specific structure and examples like "ARG01".
2. **DRG (Discourse Representation Graphs)**: Another framework used in the evaluation.
3. **EDS (Elementary Dependency Structures)**: A framework that's part of the evaluation.
4. **PTG (Prague Tectogrammatical Graphs)**: One of the frameworks evaluated.
5. **UCCA (Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation)**: Another framework used.

Each of these frameworks is a dataset in the context of the shared task. The paper also mentions that the system was evaluated across four languages, but the datasets themselves are the frameworks, not the languages.

I need to extract metadata for each of these datasets. The creators are the authors of each framework, but since the paper doesn't provide specific creators for each framework, I'll note that as empty. The descriptions are based on how the paper uses or describes each framework. The titles are the names of the frameworks. The issued year isn't provided, so it's empty. The language isn't specified for the datasets, so that's empty. Identifiers, landing pages, versions, formats, and tasks are also not provided, so they remain empty.

I'll structure each dataset with the available information, ensuring that each framework is listed as a separate dataset with its respective details.
