Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about automatic processing of metrical forms in verse texts, specifically focusing on French poetry and drama from the early 17th to the early 20th century. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper talks about a corpus of poetic and dramatic texts. It mentions that the corpus includes 8900 poems and 75 plays by 56 authors, totaling 540,000 verses. This corpus is stored in a database that includes results from metrical, rhyme, and strophic analysis.

I also notice that the paper references the work of B. de Cornulier, who has done significant work on French metrics. The authors mention that they compare their results with manually analyzed data from Cornulier's work. However, the paper doesn't provide a specific name for this dataset or a URL or DOI, so I can't include it as a separate dataset.

The main dataset mentioned is the corpus used in the AnamA tre project. It's described in detail in the paper, so I can extract its metadata. The creators are the authors of the paper, Aliane Delente and Richard Renault. The description is based on how they used the corpus. The title is "AnamA tre Corpus." The issued year isn't explicitly mentioned, but since the paper was presented in 2015, I'll use that as the issued year. The language is French. There's no specific identifier like a DOI or URL provided, so that field remains empty. The theme is "French Poetry and Drama." The keywords include "metrical analysis," "poetic corpus," "rhyme schemes," and "strophic analysis." The landing page is also empty as no URL is provided. There's no version mentioned, so that's empty. The format is text, and the task is "metrical analysis."

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The references at the end include works by Cornulier, but they aren't datasets in the context of this paper. Therefore, the only dataset extracted is the AnamA tre Corpus.
