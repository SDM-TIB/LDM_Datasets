Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "A Graph Based Semi-Supervised Approach for Analysis of Derivational Nouns in Sanskrit" by Amrith Krishna, Pavankumar Satuluri, Harshavardhan Ponnada, Muneeb Ahmed, Gulab Arora, Kaustubh Hiware, and Pawan Goyal. It's about a semi-supervised approach to identify derivational nouns in Sanskrit using graph-based methods.

Looking through the abstract, the authors mention that they used a small labeled dataset (5% of the entire dataset) and a semi-supervised approach. However, they don't explicitly name any datasets. 

In the introduction, they reference the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit, The Sanskrit Library, and GRETIL as examples of digitized ancient manuscripts. These are likely the datasets they used.

In the methodology section, they mention using multiple lexicons and corpora to obtain their vocabulary, including IndoWordNet, a digitized version of the Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English dictionary, the Apte Sanskrit-Sanskrit Dictionary, and the Sanskrit Heritage Engine. These are additional datasets they used.

In the experiments section, they mention obtaining ground truth data from the Apte Sanskrit-Sanskrit dictionary and using it to manually tag some word pairs. This indicates that the Apte dictionary is another dataset they used.

So, the datasets mentioned in the paper are:
1. Digital Corpus of Sanskrit
2. The Sanskrit Library
3. GRETIL
4. IndoWordNet
5. Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English dictionary
6. Apte Sanskrit-Sanskrit Dictionary
7. Sanskrit Heritage Engine

Now, I'll extract the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
