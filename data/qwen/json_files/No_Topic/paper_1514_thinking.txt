Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "A Decade of Automatic Content Evaluation of News Summaries: Reassessing the State of the Art" by Peter A. Rankel and others. It discusses the evaluation of automatic summarization systems using ROUGE metrics over four years of data from the Text Analysis Conference (TAC).

Looking through the paper, I notice that the datasets mentioned are related to the TAC evaluations from 2008 to 2011. Specifically, the paper refers to the summarization tasks (task A and task B) and the manual evaluation methods like the pyramid method and responsiveness.

I should check if these are considered datasets. The TAC datasets are collections of documents and summaries used for evaluating summarization systems. Each year's TAC data can be considered a separate dataset.

Now, I'll extract the metadata for each dataset:

1. **TAC 2008**: Includes task A (query-focused summaries) and task B (update summaries). The manual evaluations used pyramid and responsiveness metrics.
2. **TAC 2009**: Similar to 2008, with task A and B, and manual evaluations.
3. **TAC 2010**: Task A becomes guided summarization, focusing on specific domains. Task B remains update summaries.
4. **TAC 2011**: Continues with guided summarization and update summaries.

Each dataset's metadata includes the creators (the authors of the paper), description, title, year, language (English), and themes related to summarization and evaluation. The format is text, and the tasks involve summarization evaluation.

I'll structure each year's TAC data as a separate dataset in the JSON response.
