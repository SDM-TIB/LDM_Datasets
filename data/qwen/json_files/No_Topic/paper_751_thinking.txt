Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about discourse annotation for Chinese text, inspired by the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB). 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to understand the context. The paper describes a discourse annotation scheme for Chinese, adapting the PDTB approach. It mentions that their scheme is similar to other PDTB-style schemes for languages like English, Turkish, Hindi, and Czech. 

Looking for datasets, I notice that the paper references the PDTB, specifically versions 2.0 and 2.0. The authors also mention the Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005) as their dataset. 

I need to extract metadata for each dataset mentioned. For the PDTB, the creators are the authors listed in the references, which include Prasad, Miltsakaki, Joshi, and Webber. The description should reflect that it's a discourse treebank for English. The title is "Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB)", and it was issued in 2008. The language is English, and the format is text. The theme is discourse analysis, and keywords include discourse relations, connectives, and annotation. 

For the Chinese Treebank, the creators are Xue, Xia, Chiou, and Palmer. It's a syntactically annotated corpus of Chinese text. The title is "Chinese Treebank", issued in 2005. The language is Chinese, and the format is text. The theme is syntactic analysis, with keywords like syntactic annotation and Chinese corpus.

I should ensure that each dataset's metadata is accurate based on the paper's references and descriptions. I'll structure this information into JSON format as required.
