Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions a corpus created through a game-with-a-purpose, which is the main focus of the paper. This corpus is referred to as the "Phrase Detectives corpus" or "PD corpus." It's described as one of the largest for coreference in English and includes a large number of judgments per markable.

Next, I'll check the introduction and background sections. The paper references several other datasets in the field of coreference resolution. These include:

1. **ONTONOTES**: Mentioned as a widely used dataset for coreference resolution.
2. **PRECO**: Another large dataset for coreference.
3. **ARRAU**: A corpus that includes various anaphoric phenomena.
4. **Groningen Meaning Bank (GMB)**: Created through the Wordrobe platform.
5. **Phrase Detectives corpus**: The main dataset discussed, which is the focus of the paper.

I'll also note that the paper discusses the use of MPA (a probabilistic model) to aggregate annotations from the Phrase Detectives corpus, creating a silver standard dataset.

Now, I'll gather the necessary metadata for each dataset:

- **Phrase Detectives corpus (PD corpus)**: Created by the authors of the paper. Description includes its size, annotation scheme, and use of MPA for aggregation. Themes include coreference resolution, anaphora, and NLP. Keywords are related to coreference, anaphora, and crowdsourcing.

- **ONTONOTES**: Created by the original authors of the dataset. Description focuses on its use in coreference tasks, with themes in NLP and coreference.

- **PRECO**: Created by its authors, described as a large dataset for coreference, with themes similar to ONTONOTES.

- **ARRAU**: Created by its authors, includes various anaphoric phenomena, with themes in coreference and anaphora.

- **Groningen Meaning Bank (GMB)**: Created through the Wordrobe platform, focusing on collaborative annotation, with themes in NLP and collaborative annotation.

Each dataset's metadata will be structured according to the specified vocabulary, ensuring all relevant fields are filled based on the information provided in the paper.
