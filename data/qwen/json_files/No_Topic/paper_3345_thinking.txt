Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about multi-task learning for cause-of-death classification using key phrase prediction. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions using verbal autopsy narratives, but it doesn't specify a dataset name. 

Looking at the introduction, the authors reference the Million Death Study (MDS) in the data section. They mention that their dataset consists of 12,045 records from the MDS. The MDS is a program that collects and codes verbal autopsies from India. 

I need to check if the MDS is a dataset or just a program. From the context, it seems like the MDS is the source of their dataset. They don't mention any other datasets, so the only dataset used in this paper is the one from the MDS.

Now, I'll extract the metadata for this dataset. The creators are the authors of the MDS, but the paper doesn't provide their names. The description is that it's a dataset of verbal autopsy records from India, grouped into 18 CoD categories. The title is "Million Death Study (MDS)". The issued year isn't explicitly mentioned, but the paper cites Westly (2013) and others, so I'll note that. The language is English. There's no DOI or URL provided, so those fields will be empty. The theme is public health, and the keywords include verbal autopsy, cause of death, and multi-task learning. The landing page is empty. The format is text. The task is cause of death classification.

I think that's all the information I can gather from the paper. There's only one dataset mentioned, which is the MDS dataset.
