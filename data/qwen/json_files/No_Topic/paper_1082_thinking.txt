Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "An Exact Penalty Method for Locally Convergent Maximum Consensus" by Huu Le, Tat-Jun Chin, and David Suter. It discusses a novel algorithm for maximum consensus estimation in computer vision tasks. 

Looking through the abstract and introduction, I don't see any specific datasets mentioned. The focus is more on the algorithm and its theoretical foundations. 

In the sections discussing experiments and results, the authors mention several datasets used to test their method. For example, they reference the VGG dataset for image pairs and the Notre Dame dataset for triangulation. Additionally, they use synthetic data for linear regression experiments.

I'll need to extract these datasets and provide their metadata as per the given vocabulary. However, the paper doesn't provide detailed references for these datasets, so some fields might remain empty.

Now, I'll structure the JSON response with the identified datasets, filling in the available information and leaving other fields empty where necessary.
