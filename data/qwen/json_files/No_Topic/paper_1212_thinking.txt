Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses predicting the compositionality of German multi-word expressions using distributional semantic models. It mentions using gold standards for evaluation.

Looking through the sections, I find references to two gold standards: GS-NN and GS-PV. These are datasets used for evaluating the model's performance on noun-noun compounds and particle verbs, respectively.

In the "Gold Standards" section, it's mentioned that GS-NN contains 868 German noun-noun compounds annotated by native speakers on a scale of 1 to 6 for compositionality. GS-PV includes 354 particle verbs, annotated using Amazon Mechanical Turk on a scale of 1 to 6.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors don't reference external datasets beyond these two gold standards. Therefore, the datasets to extract are GS-NN and GS-PV.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided.
