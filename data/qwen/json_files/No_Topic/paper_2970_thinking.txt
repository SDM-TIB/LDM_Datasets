Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Glyph2Vec: Learning Chinese Out-of-Vocabulary Word Embedding from Glyphs" by Hong-You Chen, Sz-Han Yu, and Shou-De Lin. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the model is tested across different applications, but doesn't specify datasets. 

Looking at the introduction, the authors reference the Sinica Corpus 4.0, which is a large-scale Chinese corpus. They mention that it includes about 10 million tokens. This seems like a key dataset used in their work.

In the experiments section, they mention using the Wikipedia Title dataset by Liu et al. (2017). This dataset is used for evaluating their model on real-world scenarios with rare words. 

Additionally, they reference the Polyglot dataset by Al-Rfou et al. (2013), which is used for sanity checks and visualizing embeddings. 

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors don't reference any other specific datasets beyond these three. 

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
