Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Lingua Custodia's Participation at the WMT 2021 Machine Translation Using Terminologies Shared Task" by Melissa Ailem, Jinghsu Liu, and Raheel Qader. It describes their submission to the WMT21 shared task, focusing on machine translation with terminologies in English to French, Russian, and Chinese.

Looking through the sections:

1. **Abstract**: Mentions the use of terminologies but doesn't specify datasets.
2. **Introduction**: Discusses the challenge of handling terminologies in MT but doesn't name datasets.
3. **Method**: Describes their approach using training data augmentation and masking but doesn't reference specific datasets.
4. **Data**: This section details the datasets used. They mention:
   - **Monolingual and Parallel Data**: For each language pair (English-French, English-Russian, English-Chinese), they use monolingual and parallel corpora.
   - **News Crawl 2020**: A dataset used for training.
   - **Medline Titles and Abstracts**: Used for English-French training.
   - **ParaCrawl, Wikimatrix, UN, Common Crawl, Yandex, CCMT**: Various datasets used across different language pairs.
5. **Results and Conclusion**: No new datasets mentioned.

Now, I need to extract metadata for each dataset mentioned. However, the paper doesn't provide detailed metadata like creators, publication dates, or URLs for these datasets. Most are referred to by their names and purposes but lack specific details.

Given the instructions, I should only include datasets explicitly mentioned. Since the paper doesn't provide enough metadata for each dataset, I'll list them with the available information, noting that some fields are empty.

The datasets identified are:
- News Crawl 2020
- Medline Titles and Abstracts
- ParaCrawl
- Wikimatrix
- UN Corpus
- Common Crawl
- Yandex
- CCMT

Each of these is used for training in different language pairs, but without specific creators, dates, or URLs, the metadata will be sparse.
