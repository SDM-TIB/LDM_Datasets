Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses a method for partial signature matching using graphical models. It mentions datasets used for evaluation.

In the introduction, the authors reference previous work on signature matching, citing datasets like the DS-I Tobacco dataset and the DS-II UMD dataset. These are likely the main datasets used in their experiments.

Moving to the experiments section, the authors detail their evaluation on three datasets derived from the DS-I and DS-II datasets. Specifically, they mention:

1. **DS-I Tobacco signature dataset**: Contains 189 clean signatures from 63 authors, three per author. Used for both full and partial signature matching.
2. **DS-II UMD signature dataset**: Contains 26,661 signatures from 887 authors, including partial and full signatures with various degradations.

The authors also mention creating partial datasets from these for testing their method. They reference other datasets like the MNIST dataset for comparison but focus on the signature datasets for their experiments.

I'll check the references section for more details on these datasets. The DS-I and DS-II datasets are cited in the paper, providing creators and descriptions.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information extracted.
