Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction sections. The abstract mentions datasets like Flickr30K, MS-COCO, and Conceptual Captions. These are likely the main datasets used in the study.

Next, I'll check the methodology and experiments sections for more details. The paper describes experiments on three datasets: Flickr30K, MS-COCO, and Conceptual Captions (CC152K). Each of these datasets is used to evaluate the proposed method.

Now, I'll gather information about each dataset:

1. **Flickr30K**: This dataset contains images with captions. The paper mentions it's used for image-text matching tasks. I'll note the creators, description, and other metadata.

2. **MS-COCO**: A well-known dataset for image captioning and retrieval. The paper uses it for evaluating cross-modal matching under noisy conditions.

3. **Conceptual Captions (CC152K)**: A large-scale dataset with noisy image-text pairs. The paper uses this to test real-world noisy correspondence scenarios.

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata fields such as creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

I'll ensure that the creators are correctly identified from the references or citations in the paper. If the dataset's creators aren't explicitly mentioned, I'll leave that field empty.

Finally, I'll structure the information into JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described according to the provided metadata vocabulary.
