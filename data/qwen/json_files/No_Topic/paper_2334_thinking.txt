Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract talks about extracting sentential patterns from a corpus for academic writing assistance. It mentions using a corpus but doesn't specify which one yet.

Moving to the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of academic writing and mention using a corpus. They reference the Citeseerx corpus as their source for extracting sentential patterns. So, Citeseerx is one dataset.

In the related work section, they mention the Argumentative Zoning (AZ) corpus, which is used for evaluating their method. This is another dataset.

Looking further, the authors also reference the Macmillan English Dictionary, which they used for examples and patterns. This is a third dataset.

I should check if there are any other datasets mentioned. The paper also mentions using GeniaTagger, but that's a tool, not a dataset. The AZ corpus is manually annotated by Teufel and collaborators, so it's a separate dataset.

Now, I'll gather the metadata for each dataset:

1. **Citeseerx Corpus**:

   - Language: English.
   - Identifier: URL is http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu.

3. **Macmillan English Dictionary**:

I need to ensure that each dataset's metadata is accurately captured based on the paper's description. I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, making sure to include all relevant fields.
