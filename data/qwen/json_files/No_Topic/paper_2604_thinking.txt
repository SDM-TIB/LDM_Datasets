Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about a machine translation system for the LoResMT Shared Task at MT Summit 2021. The authors built statistical translation systems for English and Marathi. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to understand the context. The paper mentions using various tokenization schemes and synthetic data created through back translation. They also reference the LoResMT shared task, which likely provides the datasets they used.

Looking at the sections, the Data section in the paper details the datasets. They mention that the organizers provided parallel and monolingual corpora. For English, they combined data from both English-Marathi and English-Irish language pairs. The Marathi data includes training and development sets. 

I need to identify the datasets mentioned. The main ones are the parallel and monolingual corpora provided by the LoResMT organizers. The paper doesn't cite external datasets beyond these, so I'll focus on these.

For each dataset, I'll extract the metadata. The creators would be the organizers of LoResMT, but since the paper doesn't specify, I'll leave it as an empty list. The description will be based on how the authors used the data. The title is "LoResMT Shared Task Dataset." The issued year is 2021. The language is English and Marathi. The landing page is the LoResMT website. The format is text, and the tasks are machine translation and data augmentation.

I'll structure this into a JSON format, ensuring all required fields are included. Since there's only one dataset mentioned, the JSON will reflect that.
