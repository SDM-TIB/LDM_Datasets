Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about a GPU-based constituency parser, and I need to identify any datasets mentioned in it. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract mentions the Berkeley Parser Grammar and the Penn Treebank, which are likely datasets used in their experiments.

Looking further into the introduction, the authors reference the Penn Treebank, specifically section 22, which is a well-known dataset in NLP. They also mention the Berkeley Parser Grammar, which is another dataset used for parsing tasks.

In the sections discussing experiments, the authors refer to the Penn Treebank again, specifically the first 1000 sentences of section 22. This indicates that the Penn Treebank is a key dataset they used for evaluation.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors don't reference any other corpora or datasets beyond the Berkeley Parser Grammar and the Penn Treebank. 

So, the datasets identified are:
1. Berkeley Parser Grammar
2. Penn Treebank (specifically section 22)

I'll need to extract metadata for each of these datasets based on the information provided in the paper.
