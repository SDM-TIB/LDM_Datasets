Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions experiments being performed on two benchmarks: PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO. These are likely the datasets used.

Next, I'll check the introduction and related work sections. The introduction refers to PASCAL VOC 2007 and MSCOCO datasets. The methods section also mentions these datasets in the context of experiments and evaluation.

In the experiments section, the datasets are clearly stated. PASCAL VOC 2007 is used for evaluation, and MSCOCO is another benchmark used. The paper provides details on how these datasets are used, such as training on combined sets and evaluating on specific subsets.

I'll also check the references for any additional datasets, but it seems the main datasets are PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO.

Now, I'll gather the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.

For PASCAL VOC:
- Creators: The authors of the dataset are not explicitly mentioned in the paper, but the creators are known to be the PASCAL VOC team.
- Description: It's a dataset for object detection with 20 categories.
- Title: PASCAL VOC 2007
- Issued: 2007
- Theme: Computer Vision, Object Detection
- Keywords: Object detection, benchmark, 20 categories
- Landing Page: The official VOC website
- Format: Images and annotations

For MSCOCO:
- Creators: The authors of the dataset are not explicitly mentioned, but it's known to be created by the COCO team.
- Description: A large-scale dataset with 80 object categories.
- Title: MSCOCO
- Issued: 2014
- Theme: Computer Vision, Object Detection
- Keywords: Object detection, benchmark, 80 categories
- Landing Page: The official COCO website
- Format: Images and annotations

I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring all metadata fields are filled appropriately.
