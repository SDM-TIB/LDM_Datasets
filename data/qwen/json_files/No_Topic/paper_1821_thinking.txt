Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses offensive language detection in multiple languages using an ensemble approach. It mentions datasets used for each language task.

Looking at the methodology section, specifically section 3.1, the datasets are listed for each language: Arabic, Turkish, Danish, Greek, and English. Each language has its own dataset, and for English, there are two datasets mentioned: OLID and SOLID.

Now, I'll identify each dataset and extract the required metadata.

1. **Arabic Dataset**:
   - Cited as (Mubarak et al., 2020).
   - Description: Comprised of offensive and non-offensive tweets.
   - Language: Arabic.
   - Tasks: Offensive language identification.

2. **Turkish Dataset**:
   - Cited as (A oltekin, 2020).
   - Description: Tweets classified as offensive or non-offensive.
   - Language: Turkish.
   - Tasks: Offensive language identification.

3. **Danish Dataset**:
   - Cited as (Sigurbergsson and Derczynski, 2020).
   - Description: Collected from social media platforms.
   - Language: Danish.
   - Tasks: Offensive language identification.

4. **Greek Dataset**:
   - Cited as (Pitenis et al., 2020).
   - Description: Product reviews and tweets.
   - Language: Greek.
   - Tasks: Offensive language identification.

5. **English OLID Dataset**:
   - Cited as (Zampieri et al., 2019).
   - Description: Offensive language identification dataset.
   - Language: English.
   - Tasks: Offensive language identification.

6. **English SOLID Dataset**:
   - Cited as (Rosenthal et al., 2020).
   - Description: Semi-supervised labeled dataset.
   - Language: English.
   - Tasks: Offensive language identification.

For each dataset, I'll fill in the metadata fields based on the information provided in the paper. If a field isn't mentioned, I'll leave it empty or as an empty list.

Now, I'll structure each dataset into the required JSON format, ensuring all fields are correctly populated.
