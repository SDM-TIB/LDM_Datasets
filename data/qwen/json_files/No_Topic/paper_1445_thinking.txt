Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses a self-supervised joint training framework for document reranking, using models like BERT. It mentions datasets used for evaluation.

In the "Experiments and Results" section, the authors specify the datasets they used: MS MARCO Passage Ranking and TREC Robust 2004. 

For MS MARCO, the paper states it's a large-scale dataset with real questions and passages from Bing search. It includes training, development, and evaluation sets. The creators are listed as Nguyen et al., and it was published in 2016.

The TREC Robust 2004 dataset is described as a newswire collection used in the TREC 2004 Robust track. It has 250 queries and half a million documents. The creator is Voorhees, and it was published in 2004.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring accuracy based on the paper's descriptions.
