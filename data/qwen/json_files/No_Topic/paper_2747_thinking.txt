Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Facial Emotion Distribution Learning by Exploiting Low-Rank Label Correlations Locally" by Xiuyi Jia and colleagues. The abstract mentions experiments on benchmark facial expression datasets, but doesn't specify which ones. 

Looking at the introduction, the authors discuss facial expression recognition and mention datasets like JAFFE and BU 3DFE. They later refer to s-JAFFE and SBU 3DFE as the datasets used in their experiments. 

In the experiments section (Section 4), the authors detail their use of two datasets: s-JAFFE and SBU 3DFE. They provide characteristics of these datasets in Table 1, which includes the number of images, features, and labels. 

I need to extract metadata for each dataset. For each, I'll look for the creator, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For s-JAFFE:
- The creators are the authors of the original JAFFE dataset, which is cited in the paper as [15], referring to M. Lyons, S. Akamatsu, M. Kamachi, and J. Gyoba.
- The description is a subset of JAFFE with emotion distributions from 60 raters.
- The title is s-JAFFE.
- The year is 2002, as per the citation.
- Language is Japanese, as the dataset involves Japanese female models.
- Identifier is empty as no DOI or URL is provided.
- Themes are Computer Vision and Facial Expression Recognition.
- Keywords include facial expressions, emotion distribution, and facial recognition.
- Landing page is empty.
- Version is empty.
- Format is Image.
- Tasks include facial expression recognition and emotion distribution learning.

For SBU 3DFE:
- The creators are the authors of the original BU 3DFE dataset, cited as [29], referring to Lijun Yin, Xiaozhou Wei, Yi Sun, Jun Wang, and Matthew J. Rosato.
- The description is a 3D facial expression dataset with emotion distributions from 60 raters.
- The title is SBU 3DFE.
- The year is 2006, as per the citation.
- Language is English.
- Identifier is empty.
- Themes are Computer Vision and Facial Expression Recognition.
- Keywords include 3D facial expressions, emotion distribution, and facial recognition.
- Landing page is empty.
- Version is empty.
- Format is Image.
- Tasks include facial expression recognition and emotion distribution learning.

I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described based on the paper's content.
