Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Neural Graph Evolution: Towards Efficient Automatic Robot Design" by Tingwu Wang, Yuhao Zhou, Sanja Fidler, and Jimmy Ba. It was published in ICLR 2019.

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors propose a method called Neural Graph Evolution (NGE) for automatic robot design. They compare their method with previous approaches and mention environments like MuJoCo.

Looking into the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges in automatic robot design and reference works by Sims (1994), Joachimczak et al. (2014), Cheney et al. (2014), and others. They also mention the use of MuJoCo for simulations.

In the background section, they discuss reinforcement learning and graph neural networks. They reference works by Todorov et al. (2012) on MuJoCo and mention environments like MuJoCo's XML files for robot design.

In the experiments section, they evaluate their method on environments such as a fish and a walker, using MuJoCo for simulations. They also reference human-engineered designs from Tassa et al. (2018).

From this, I can gather that the primary dataset or environment used is MuJoCo, which is a physics engine used for simulating robotic environments. The authors don't explicitly mention other datasets, but they do reference environments created using MuJoCo, such as the fish and walker environments.

I'll check the references section to confirm. The references include MuJoCo by Todorov et al. (2012) and works by Tassa et al. (2018) on human-engineered designs. There's no mention of other datasets like ImageNet or CIFAR-10, which are common in other domains.

Therefore, the main dataset or environment used in this paper is MuJoCo, which is a simulation environment rather than a traditional dataset. However, since the paper uses MuJoCo for evaluating their method, it's relevant to mention it as the environment used.

I'll structure the JSON response accordingly, noting that MuJoCo is the environment used for simulations and evaluations in the paper.
