Alright, I'm looking at the provided paper text, which is the proceedings from the EMNLP 2013 conference. My task is to extract all the datasets mentioned in this paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. 

First, I'll scan through the table of contents and the individual paper titles to identify any mentions of datasets. I notice several papers that reference datasets, such as "MCTest: A Challenge Dataset for the Open-Domain Machine Comprehension of Text" by Matthew Richardson, Christopher J.C. Burges, and Erin Renshaw. This seems to be a primary dataset used in one of the conference papers.

Another dataset mentioned is "Building Event Threads out of Multiple News Articles" by Xavier Tannier and VÃ©ronique Moriceau. This dataset involves news articles and event threading, which is relevant for event extraction tasks.

Additionally, there's a mention of "A Dataset for Research on Short-Text Conversations" by Hao Wang, Zhengdong Lu, Hang Li, and Enhong Chen. This dataset focuses on short-text conversations, which is useful for dialogue systems and conversation analysis.

I'll also check if there are any other datasets referenced in the papers listed. For example, "Harvesting Parallel News Streams to Generate Paraphrases of Event Relations" by Congle Zhang and Daniel S. Weld might use a dataset of news streams, but it's not explicitly named as a dataset in the provided text.

After identifying these datasets, I'll extract their metadata as per the guidelines. For each dataset, I'll note the creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, themes, keywords, landing page, version, format, and relevant tasks.

I need to ensure that the creators are correctly identified as the authors of the dataset, not the authors of the conference paper. If the dataset's creators aren't explicitly mentioned, I'll leave that field empty. Similarly, if there's no specific identifier like a DOI or URL, I'll leave that field empty as well.

Finally, I'll structure each dataset's information into the required JSON format, making sure to include all the necessary metadata fields. If any information isn't available, I'll leave the corresponding field empty or as an empty list.
