Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about smoothing structured conditional probability matrices, particularly in the context of language modeling. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets might be mentioned. The abstract talks about bigram models and language processing, but doesn't mention specific datasets. 

Moving on to the introduction, the authors discuss probability estimation and conditional probability matrices, but again, no specific datasets are named. They mention applications like word frequencies and bacterial species, but these are more about the methodology than datasets.

In the related work section, they reference other studies, but these are more about methods and models rather than datasets. For example, they mention Latent Dirichlet Allocation and non-negative matrix factorization, but no datasets are cited here.

The problem statement and main results sections delve into the mathematical framework and algorithms, without referencing any datasets. 

When I get to the experiments section, that's where datasets might be mentioned. The authors describe synthetic models and real data. They mention using synthetic data generated with uniformly sampled rows and power law distributions. For real data, they reference several datasets:

1. **tartuffe**: A French text dataset with training and test sizes of 9.3k words and a vocabulary size of 2.8k words.
2. **genesis**: An English version dataset with training and test sizes of 19k words and a vocabulary size of 4.4k words.
3. **brown**: A shortened Brown corpus with training and test sizes of 20k words and a vocabulary size of 10.5k words.

These datasets are used to evaluate their algorithms, comparing performance metrics like cross-entropy. The authors also mention using model selection techniques, like cross-validation, to choose the best rank parameter.

I don't see any references to external datasets beyond these three. The paper doesn't provide DOIs or URLs for these datasets, so the identifiers will be empty. The themes are related to natural language processing and language modeling. The keywords include language modeling, cross-entropy, and smoothing techniques.

So, the datasets mentioned are tartuffe, genesis, and brown. Each is described in terms of their use in experiments, their sizes, and the languages they're in. The tasks involve language modeling and evaluation of smoothing techniques.
