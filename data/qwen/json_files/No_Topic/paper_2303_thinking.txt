Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper focuses on RGB-D action recognition using a deep bilinear learning framework. It mentions experiments on two public datasets: NTU RGB+D and SYSU 3D HOI.

Next, I'll check the sections where these datasets are described. The NTU RGB+D dataset is detailed in section 4.2, and the SYSU 3D HOI dataset is described in section 4.3. Both datasets are used to evaluate the proposed method under different evaluation settings.

For each dataset, I need to extract the required metadata fields. Let's start with NTU RGB+D:

- **dcterms:creator**: The authors of the dataset are mentioned in the paper's references. From the reference, the creators are J. Wang, Z. Liu, and G. Wang.
- **dcterms:description**: The dataset is described as a large-scale RGB-D human action recognition dataset with 40 subjects performing 60 actions, captured from three views.
- **dcterms:title**: "NTU RGB+D Dataset"
- **dcterms:issued**: The year is 2016, as per the reference.
- **dcterms:language**: Not applicable, as it's a video dataset.
- **dcterms:identifier**: The URL provided in the reference is http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~liao/RGBDActionDataset.html.
- **dcat:theme**: Computer Vision, Action Recognition.
- **dcat:keyword**: RGB-D, Action Recognition, Human Actions.
- **dcat:landingPage**: The URL from the identifier.
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Not mentioned.
- **dcterms:format**: Video.
- **mls:task**: Action Recognition.

Now, for the SYSU 3D HOI dataset:

- **dcterms:creator**: The authors are J. F. Hu, W. S. Zheng, L. Ma, G. Wang, and J. Lai, as mentioned in the paper.
- **dcterms:description**: A dataset for studying human-object interactions with 480 samples across 6 interaction pairs.
- **dcterms:title**: "SYSU 3D HOI Dataset"
- **dcterms:issued**: The year is 2016, based on the reference.
- **dcterms:language**: Not applicable.
- **dcterms:identifier**: The URL is http://www.cse.ust.hk/~zhangjia/3DHOI/.
- **dcat:theme**: Computer Vision, Human-Object Interaction.
- **dcat:keyword**: RGB-D, Human-Object Interaction, Action Recognition.
- **dcat:landingPage**: The URL from the identifier.
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Not mentioned.
- **dcterms:format**: Video.
- **mls:task**: Action Recognition, Human-Object Interaction.

I need to ensure that all fields are correctly filled based on the information provided in the paper. If any information is missing, I'll leave the corresponding field empty.
