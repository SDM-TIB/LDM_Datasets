Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about using social media posts, specifically from Facebook, to generate life stories. The authors describe their approach to sourcing storytelling knowledge from these posts, classifying them, and generating events.

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper doesn't explicitly reference external datasets, but it does describe the data they collected and used. They mention gathering 21,412 social media posts from 216 user accounts using Facebook's Graph API. This data was then annotated and classified into categories like Celebrating, Travelling, Eating, and Drinking.

Since the paper doesn't cite external datasets, the main dataset here is the one they collected themselves. I'll need to describe this dataset using the provided metadata vocabulary.

The creators of this dataset are the authors of the paper: Robee Khyra Mae J. Te, Janica Mae M. Lam, and Ethel Ong. The description should include the purpose of the dataset, which is to generate life stories from social media posts. The title can be something like "Facebook Life Stories Dataset." The issued year isn't explicitly mentioned, but the paper was published in 2018, so I'll use that. The language is English, and the format is text. The themes are Social Media and Life Stories, and the keywords include Social Media Posts, Life Events, Story Generation, etc. The landing page isn't provided, so it remains empty.

I'll structure this information into a JSON format as specified, ensuring all required fields are included.
