Alright, I'm looking at the provided research paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper discusses a framework for semantic role assignment using extended lexical conceptual structures, comparing it with VerbNet and FrameNet. 

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract mentions PropBank and FrameNet as resources for semantic parsing. 

In the introduction, the paper again refers to PropBank and FrameNet as widely accepted resources. It also mentions the Kyoto University Text Corpus (KTC) as a resource used in their analysis. 

Looking further, the paper discusses the construction of an LCS dictionary for 60 Japanese verbs, using KTC and other resources. It doesn't mention any other datasets beyond PropBank, FrameNet, and KTC.

Now, I'll check the references section for any additional datasets. The references include works on FrameNet, PropBank, and other linguistic resources, but no new datasets beyond those already mentioned.

So, the datasets identified are PropBank, FrameNet, and KTC. I'll extract their metadata based on the information provided in the paper.
