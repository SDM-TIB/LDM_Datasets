Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract mentions using a supervised topic modeling approach on central bank speeches and Greenbook data. The Greenbook data is mentioned as being released with a five-year delay, covering sections on GDP, CPI, and unemployment forecasts.

Next, I'll examine the sections detailing the methodology and data sources. In the "3 Data" section, the paper describes two datasets: the FED's Greenbook data and the speeches of central bankers. The Greenbook data spans from 1990 to 2013 and includes both numerical and text data. The speeches dataset comprises over 3000 transcripts from 1993 to 2013.

I'll check the references for any additional datasets, but the paper doesn't cite external datasets beyond the Greenbook and speeches. The authors created their own monetary policy shock series based on these datasets, so no external datasets are mentioned.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the metadata fields:

1. **Greenbook Data**:
   - **Creator**: The Federal Reserve (FED).
   - **Description**: Contains numerical and text data from the Greenbook reports, including forecasts and explanations.
   - **Title**: FED Greenbook Data.
   - **Issued**: 1990-2013.
   - **Language**: English.
   - **Identifier**: Not provided.
   - **Theme**: Economics, Monetary Policy.
   - **Keywords**: Greenbook, forecasts, monetary policy.
   - **Landing Page**: Not provided.

   - **Task**: Monetary policy analysis, forecasting.

2. **Central Bank Speeches**:
   - **Creator**: The Federal Reserve (FED).
   - **Description**: Transcripts of speeches by central bankers from 1993 to 2013.
   - **Title**: Central Bank Speeches.
   - **Issued**: 1993-2013.
   - **Language**: English.
   - **Identifier**: Not provided.

   - **Keywords**: Speeches, monetary policy communication.
   - **Landing Page**: Not provided.

I'll ensure that each field is accurately filled based on the information provided in the paper. If any details are missing, I'll leave the corresponding field empty.
