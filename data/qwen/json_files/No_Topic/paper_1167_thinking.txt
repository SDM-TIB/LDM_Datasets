Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, the paper is about unsupervised hyperalignment for multilingual word embeddings. It discusses aligning word vectors across multiple languages without supervision. 

Looking through the paper, I notice references to datasets used for evaluation. In the "Experimental Results" section, they mention using the MUSE benchmark. MUSE is a dataset for evaluating bilingual word embeddings, containing various language pairs and their translations.

Additionally, the paper uses fastText word vectors trained on the Wikipedia Corpus. This dataset is used as the source of word embeddings for their experiments.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors primarily rely on MUSE for evaluation and fastText for their word vectors.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset as per the given vocabulary.
