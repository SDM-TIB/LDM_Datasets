Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract talks about providing writing feedback to English language learners and mentions using crowdsourcing on Amazon Mechanical Turk. It doesn't reference any specific datasets yet.

Moving on to the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of feedback types and mention that their study is preliminary. They reference previous studies but don't mention datasets here.

In the related work section, they discuss various studies on feedback, including those by Criterion, Biber et al., and Nagata and Nakatani. Nagata and Nakatani's study uses an automated error detection system, but no specific dataset is named here.

The experimental setup section is where I find the first mention of a dataset. They mention using the CLC-FCE corpus, which was manually annotated for preposition errors by professional English language instructors. This seems like a key dataset used in their study.

Looking further, they describe how they selected sentences from this corpus, ensuring suitability and dividing them into HITs for Mechanical Turk. The CLC-FCE corpus is clearly the main dataset they used for their experiments.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the rest of the paper. The references section lists various studies but doesn't provide additional datasets beyond the CLC-FCE corpus.

So, the only dataset identified in this paper is the CLC-FCE corpus. I'll extract its metadata based on the information provided.
