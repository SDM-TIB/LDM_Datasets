Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The abstract mentions experiments on the noisy CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Clothing1M datasets. These are the primary datasets used in the paper.

Next, I'll check the sections where these datasets are described in more detail. The paper mentions that CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are clean datasets except for Clothing1M, which is a real-world dataset with noisy labels. The authors manually corrupt CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using a label transition matrix for symmetric and asymmetric flipping.

For each dataset, I need to extract the required metadata fields. Let's break them down:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   - **Creator**: The original authors are Krizhevsky et al., but the paper's authors used it.
   - **Description**: A clean dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images with 10 classes, manually corrupted for experiments.
   - **Title**: CIFAR-10
   - **Issued**: 2010
   - **Theme**: Computer Vision, Image Classification
   - **Keywords**: Image classification, noisy labels, benchmark
   - **Format**: Image
   - **Task**: Image classification

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   - **Creator**: Same as CIFAR-10.
   - **Description**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, used for experiments with noisy labels.
   - **Title**: CIFAR-100
   - **Issued**: 2010
   - **Theme**: Computer Vision, Image Classification
   - **Keywords**: Image classification, noisy labels, benchmark
   - **Format**: Image
   - **Task**: Image classification

3. **Clothing1M**:
   - **Creator**: Xiao et al.
   - **Description**: A large-scale dataset with 1 million clothing images and noisy labels, used for real-world noisy label experiments.
   - **Title**: Clothing1M
   - **Issued**: 2015
   - **Theme**: Computer Vision, Image Classification, Noisy Labels
   - **Keywords**: Noisy labels, clothing classification, real-world dataset
   - **Format**: Image
   - **Task**: Image classification

I'll ensure each dataset is accurately described based on the paper's usage and the provided references. Now, I'll structure this information into the required JSON format.
