Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, the paper is titled "Design of BCCWJ-EEG: Balanced Corpus with Human Electroencephalography" by Yohei Oseki and Masayuki Asahara. The abstract mentions the creation of BCCWJ-EEG, which is a corpus annotated with EEG data. 

Looking further into the paper, the authors discuss related work and other datasets. In Section 2, they review several language resources annotated with human language processing data. These include:

1. **Dundee Corpus**: An eye-tracking corpus with English newspaper articles.
2. **Potsdam Sentence Corpus**: An eye-tracking corpus with German sentences.
3. **Natural Stories Corpus**: Contains English stories with self-paced reading and fMRI data.
4. **Ghent Eye-Tracking Corpus (GECO)**: Includes English and Dutch data.
5. **UCL Corpus**: An EEG corpus with English sentences.
6. **Alice Corpus**: An EEG and fMRI corpus with English text.
7. **Zurich Cognitive Language Processing Corpus (ZuCo)**: Combines EEG and eye-tracking data.

Additionally, the paper mentions the **BCCWJ-EyeTrack** corpus, which is an eye-tracking version of the BCCWJ corpus, and the **BCCWJ** itself, which is a balanced corpus of contemporary written Japanese.

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields. For each dataset, I'll extract the creator(s), description, title, publication year, language, identifier, themes, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For example, the Dundee Corpus is created by Kennedy and Pynte, published in 2005, and involves eye-tracking data. Similarly, the BCCWJ-EEG is created by the paper's authors, published in 2020, and includes EEG data.

I'll ensure that each dataset's metadata is accurate based on the information provided in the paper. If a field isn't specified, I'll leave it empty or use an appropriate placeholder.
