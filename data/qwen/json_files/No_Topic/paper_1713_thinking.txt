Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract to get an overview. It mentions a system for event extraction across documents and languages, using a Wikinews corpus of 120 English articles translated into Spanish and Dutch. So, the main dataset here is the Wikinews corpus.

Next, I'll look through the introduction. It talks about using a corpus of English Wikinews articles translated into Spanish and Dutch. This confirms the Wikinews corpus as the primary dataset.

Moving to the related work section, I don't see any new datasets mentioned. It references UIMA, OntoNotes, and other frameworks, but these aren't datasets.

In the section about the representation of event mentions and instances, the paper continues to discuss the Wikinews corpus, emphasizing its use across languages and documents.

The evaluation section mentions processing 120 articles in each language, which again points to the Wikinews corpus as the dataset used.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the rest of the paper. The focus is on the Wikinews corpus and its translations into Spanish and Dutch.

So, the only dataset mentioned is the Wikinews corpus. I'll extract its metadata based on the information provided in the paper.
