Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions using dependency annotations for linguistic description, comparing linear and syntactic n-grams. No specific datasets are named here.

Moving to the introduction, the authors discuss the use of linear n-grams and their limitations, especially in languages like German. They reference related work but don't mention specific datasets.

In section 2, they describe syntactic n-grams and reference Sidorov et al. (2012) and Goldberg and Orwant (2013). These are methodological references, not datasets.

Section 3 discusses related work, citing studies that use syntactic features but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Section 4.2 mentions the Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks. This is a key point. UD treebanks are datasets of annotated sentences for various languages. The authors use these to compare distances between heads and dependents across languages.

In section 5, they describe their study using a corpus of 60 German PhD theses, split between linguistics and literary studies. This is another dataset they created or used for their analysis.

Section 6 discusses the results and methods, including the use of MATE dependency parser trained on the TIGER Corpus. The TIGER Corpus is another dataset used for parsing.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks
2. The corpus of 60 German PhD theses
3. TIGER Corpus

Now, I'll extract metadata for each dataset based on the paper's description.
