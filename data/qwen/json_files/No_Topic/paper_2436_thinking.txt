Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses federated learning and mentions several datasets in the context of experiments and evaluations. 

Looking at the "5. Experiments" section, the authors mention several datasets:
1. MNIST
2. Federated Extended MNIST (FEMNIST)
3. FMNIST*
4. Sentiment140 (Sent140)
5. The Complete Works of William Shakespeare

Each of these datasets is used to evaluate the performance of the FedProx framework. 

Now, I'll extract metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.

For MNIST:
- It's a well-known dataset of handwritten digits.
- The authors use it for image classification tasks.
- The dataset is created by Yann LeCun and colleagues.
- It's published in 1998.
- The format is image data.

For FEMNIST:
- It's an extension of MNIST for handwritten letters.
- Created by G. Cohen and colleagues.
- Published in 2017.
- Format is image data.

FMNIST* is a variation of FEMNIST, focusing on a subset of characters, but the creators and details are the same as FEMNIST.

Sentiment140:
- A dataset for sentiment analysis on tweets.
- Created by Go et al. in 2009.
- Format is text data.

Shakespeare dataset:
- Contains text from William Shakespeare's works.
- Used for next character prediction tasks.
- The exact creators aren't specified in the paper, but it's referenced from McMahan et al., 2017.
- Format is text data.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring accuracy based on the information provided in the paper.
