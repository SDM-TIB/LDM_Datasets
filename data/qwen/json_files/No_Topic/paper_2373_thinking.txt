Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Self-Interpretable Model with TransformationEquivariant Interpretation" by Yipei Wang and Xiaoqian Wang. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets they might have used. The abstract mentions that they propose a model called SITE (Self-Interpretable model with Transformation Equivariant Interpretation) and validate it on various datasets. 

Looking at the introduction, they discuss the importance of data augmentation, especially geometric transformations, in training deep learning models. They mention applications in medical image analysis and reinforcement learning, but I don't see any specific datasets mentioned here.

Moving on to the related work section, they talk about different interpretation methods and models, but again, no specific datasets are cited. 

In the experiments section, they mention conducting experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. MNIST is a well-known dataset of handwritten digits, and CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 10 classes of small images. They also refer to the TorchRay toolkit for implementing post-hoc methods, but that's a tool, not a dataset.

In the results, they provide accuracy comparisons on MNIST and CIFAR-10, which are standard datasets. They don't mention any other datasets, so I can conclude that the datasets used are MNIST and CIFAR-10.

Now, I need to extract the metadata for each dataset. For MNIST, the creators are Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. It's a dataset of handwritten digits, published in 1998. The format is image, and it's used for classification tasks. The landing page is the official MNIST website.

For CIFAR-10, the creator is Alex Krizhevsky. It's a dataset of 10 classes of small images, published in 2009. The format is image, and it's used for classification tasks. The landing page is the official CIFAR website.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper, so these are the only two datasets to include.
