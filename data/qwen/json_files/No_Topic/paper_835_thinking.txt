Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about disfluences in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease, focusing on segmental, suprasegmental, and gestural markers. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors describe their own study, where they collected data from 10 patients with Alzheimer's and 10 controls. They mention using a corpus of their own creation, which includes audiovisual recordings of participants performing repetition tasks with and without gestures. 

I don't see any references to external datasets in the paper. The datasets mentioned are their own, so I need to describe them using the provided metadata vocabulary. 

The dataset is created by the authors, so the creators are Diane Caussade, Nathalie Vallée, Nathalie Henrich Bernardoni, Jean-Marc Colletta, Silvain Gerber, Frédérique Letué, and Marie-José Martinez. The description should include that it's a corpus of audiovisual data from participants performing specific tasks. The title is "Disfluences Corpus in Alzheimer's Disease." It was issued in 2016. The language is French, as the participants were French speakers. The format is audio and video. The themes are linguistics, cognitive science, and Alzheimer's disease. The keywords include disfluences, Alzheimer's, segmental, suprasegmental, and gestures. The task is analyzing disfluences in speech and gestures.

I need to structure this into JSON format, ensuring all fields are filled appropriately. Since there's only one dataset mentioned, the JSON will have one entry.
