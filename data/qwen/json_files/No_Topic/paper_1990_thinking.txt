Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "A Low Power, Fully Event-Based Gesture Recognition System" and is authored by a team from IBM Research, UC San Diego, and other institutions. The abstract mentions the use of a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) and a newly collected dataset called DvsGesture.

Looking through the introduction, the authors discuss event-based computation and gesture recognition. They reference previous work on gesture recognition systems but don't mention specific datasets used in those works.

In the related work section, they mention several gesture recognition datasets, such as the one used by [20], which is the first to use a DVS for gesture recognition. However, the authors state that this dataset is not large enough for training a CNN, leading them to create their own dataset.

The dataset collection section (5.1) describes the creation of the DvsGesture dataset. It includes 1,342 instances of 11 hand gestures from 29 subjects under three lighting conditions. The dataset is available at a specific URL.

No other datasets are mentioned in the paper. The authors only reference their own dataset and briefly mention another dataset from previous work without providing details.

So, the only dataset explicitly mentioned and described in the paper is DvsGesture.
