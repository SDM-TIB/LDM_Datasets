Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Discourse Sense Classification from Scratch using Focused RNNs" by Gregor Weiss and Marko Bajec. It discusses their approach to discourse sense classification using neural networks, specifically focusing on the CoNLL 2016 Shared Task.

In the abstract, they mention the CoNLL 2016 Shared Task, which focuses on multilingual shallow discourse parsing based on the English Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) and the Chinese Discourse TreeBank (CDTB). They also mention evaluation on separate test and blind datasets on the remote TIRA evaluation system.

Looking further into the introduction, they elaborate on the CoNLL 2016 Shared Task, which uses the PDTB for English and CDTB for Chinese. They also mention the blind test datasets from Wikinews.

In the evaluation section, they discuss the datasets used: PDTB for English, CDTB for Chinese, and two unknown blind test datasets from Wikinews. They provide details about the number of documents and discourse relations in each dataset.

Additionally, the references section includes citations for the PDTB and CDTB, providing more context about these datasets.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) for English
2. Chinese Discourse TreeBank (CDTB)
3. Blind test datasets from Wikinews

Now, I'll extract the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
