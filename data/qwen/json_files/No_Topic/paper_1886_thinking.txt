Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses handling noisy labels in supervised learning using a framework called RICI. It mentions experiments on several benchmark datasets and a real-world noisy dataset.

Looking at the methodology section, I don't see any datasets mentioned there. The experiments section is where datasets are likely referenced. Scanning through, I find mentions of MNIST, CIFAR10, SVHN, and ANIMAL10 datasets.

For each dataset, I need to extract the metadata fields. Let's start with MNIST. It's a well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification. The creators are Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, and P. Haffner. The description should reflect its use in the paper, which is for evaluating the framework under noisy labels. The title is "MNIST," published in 1998. It's in English, no specific identifier mentioned, the theme is computer vision, keywords include handwritten digits and benchmark. The landing page is the official website. The format is image, and the task is classification.

Next, CIFAR10. Created by A. Krizhevsky, G. Hinton, and others. It's used for image classification with 10 classes. Published in 2009. Themes and keywords similar to MNIST. Landing page is the official site. Format is image, task is classification.

SVHN is another dataset, created by Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu, and A. Y. Ng. It's for digit recognition in natural images. Published in 2011. Themes and keywords focus on digits and real-world images. Landing page is the official site. Format is image, task is classification.

Lastly, ANIMAL10. Created by C. Song, M. Kim, and J. G. Lee. It's a real-world dataset with noisy labels, used to evaluate the framework's robustness. Published in 2019. Themes include animal classification and noisy labels. Keywords are animal images and noisy labels. Landing page is the official site. Format is image, task is classification.

I need to ensure each dataset's metadata is accurate based on the paper's description. No additional datasets are mentioned, so I'll stop here.
