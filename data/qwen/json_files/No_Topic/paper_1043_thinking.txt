Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about adapting the PULS framework to analyze Russian text. It mentions several tools and resources used in the process, such as the AOT toolkit, GeoNames, and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). 

First, I need to identify which of these are datasets. The AOT toolkit is a software tool, not a dataset. GeoNames is a database of geographical names, so that's a dataset. ICD-10 is a classification system for diseases, which also qualifies as a dataset. 

Next, I should look for any other datasets mentioned. The paper discusses using a corpus of Russian documents for evaluation, but it doesn't provide a specific name for this corpus. It also mentions using a comparable news corpus from Klementiev and Roth (2006), which is another dataset. 

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields. For GeoNames, the creator is the GeoNames project, the description is about geographical information, and the language is English. The ICD-10 dataset is maintained by the World Health Organization, and it's in English. The comparable news corpus from Klementiev and Roth is in English and Russian, focusing on news content.

I need to ensure that each dataset's metadata is accurate based on the paper's description. I'll avoid including any tools or software as datasets. Only the resources that provide structured data qualify.
