Alright, I'm looking at the provided paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper is about a search engine called fokas that uses named entity evolution recognition. 

In the abstract, they mention using the New York Times corpus. That's one dataset. 

Looking through the introduction, they again refer to the New York Times corpus, noting its 20-year span and various name changes, which makes it suitable for their method. 

In the references, I see a mention of a dataset by Tahmasebi et al. (2012a), specifically the "Named entity evolution dataset." This is another dataset they used.

So, I've identified two datasets: the New York Times corpus and the Named entity evolution dataset. 

For each, I'll extract the metadata as per the instructions. The creators are the authors listed in the references. The descriptions are based on how the paper describes their use. The titles are straightforward. The issued year for the New York Times corpus isn't explicitly given, so I'll leave it empty. The language is English. The landing page for the named entity dataset is provided in the reference. Themes, keywords, and tasks are based on the context in the paper.
