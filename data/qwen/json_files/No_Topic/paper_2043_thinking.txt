Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, I'll look through the abstract and introduction. The abstract mentions evaluating distributional semantic models (DSMs) on four datasets for English and French. It specifically names the Reddy dataset, which is a well-known resource for compositionality prediction. 

Moving to the Related Work section, the paper discusses several datasets. It mentions the Reddy dataset again, which includes 90 English nominal compounds with compositionality scores. Additionally, it refers to an extended version called Reddy++ with 180 entries. The Farahmand dataset is also mentioned, containing 1042 English compounds with binary non-compositionality judgments. Lastly, the FR-comp dataset is introduced, which includes 180 French nominal compounds.

In the Materials and Methods section, the paper details the use of these datasets for evaluating the performance of various DSMs. It provides further information on how each dataset was constructed and used, which helps in describing them accurately.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the metadata fields:

1. **Reddy Dataset**: Created by Reddy et al., it contains 90 English compounds with compositionality scores. The description should include its purpose and structure. The year is 2011, and it's in English. The theme is linguistics, and keywords include compositionality and nominal compounds.

2. **Reddy++ Dataset**: An extension of Reddy's work by Ramisch et al., it includes 180 compounds. The details are similar to Reddy but with a larger scope. The year is 2016.

3. **Farahmand Dataset**: Created by Farahmand et al., it has 1042 compounds with binary judgments. The year is 2015, and the language is English. The theme and keywords are similar to Reddy's datasets.

4. **FR-comp Dataset**: Also by Ramisch et al., it focuses on French compounds. The year is 2016, and the language is French. The theme and keywords reflect its focus on French nominal compounds.

I'll ensure each dataset's metadata is accurate, including creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, languages, themes, keywords, and tasks. Since the paper doesn't provide DOIs or URLs for these datasets, those fields will remain empty.
