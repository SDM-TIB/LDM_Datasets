Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about the acoustic cues of Thai verbal irony, specifically sarcasm. The authors conducted a study where they measured various acoustic parameters from Thai speakers reading sentences neutrally and sarcastically.

First, I'll go through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that four Thai speakers participated in reading tasks, but that's about the participants, not a dataset. The methodology section describes the data collection process: they recorded 30 sentences with and without biasing contexts. They used Praat software for acoustic analysis and R for statistical analysis. 

Looking at the references, I see they cited several studies, but those are sources, not datasets. The datasets mentioned in the paper are the ones they created or used for their analysis. The main dataset seems to be the recordings of the participants reading the sentences, which they analyzed for various acoustic cues.

I need to structure this into the required metadata fields. The creators would be the authors of the paper since they created the dataset. The description would include the details of the study, like the number of participants, sentences, and the acoustic parameters measured. The title could be something like "Thai Sarcasm Acoustic Dataset." The issued year isn't explicitly mentioned, but the paper was published in 2023. The language is Thai. The format is audio. The themes would be linguistics and acoustic analysis. Keywords include Thai, sarcasm, acoustic cues, etc. The tasks involve speech analysis and acoustic parameter measurement.

I should make sure not to include any references or other papers, just the datasets mentioned in this specific paper. Since the dataset isn't published elsewhere, the landing page and identifier might be empty.
