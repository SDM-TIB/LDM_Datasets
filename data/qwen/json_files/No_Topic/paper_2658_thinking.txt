Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Sampling via Controlled Stochastic Dynamical Systems" and is authored by Benjamin J. Zhang, Tuhin Sahai, and Youssef M. Marzouk. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to understand the context. The paper presents a framework for constructing controlled stochastic dynamical systems to sample from probability distributions with Gaussian tails. They mention using a reference stochastic differential equation (SDE) and the Doob h-transform to achieve exact sampling. 

In the background section, they discuss controlled diffusion processes and the use of eigenfunctions of the Markov generator. They reference the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process as a linear SDE with known eigenfunctions. 

Moving to the numerical examples section, they describe experiments using Gaussian mixture models. Specifically, they mention a 1-D Gaussian mixture model target with two components and a 2-D example. These are synthetic datasets created for testing their method. 

Looking through the references, I don't see any citations to external datasets. The datasets used are synthetic, generated for the purpose of evaluating their sampling method. 

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. A 1-D Gaussian mixture model.
2. A 2-D non-Gaussian distribution.

These datasets are described in the paper but are not external datasets with creators or identifiers. Therefore, the metadata fields like creator, identifier, landing page, etc., would be empty or not applicable.
