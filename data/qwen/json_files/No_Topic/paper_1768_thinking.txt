Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, the paper is about InstaHide, a method for collaborative training of neural networks using mixed images. The authors discuss their theoretical framework and mention several datasets used in their experiments.

Looking through the paper, I see references to MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. These are all well-known datasets in machine learning.

- **MNIST**: This dataset is used for handwritten digit classification. It's mentioned in the context of InstaHide's application.
- **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**: These are datasets of small images used for object recognition. CIFAR-10 has 10 classes, while CIFAR-100 has 100 classes.
- **ImageNet**: A large dataset of images with thousands of classes, used for image classification tasks.

Each of these datasets is described in the paper as being used with InstaHide for training neural networks. The authors don't provide specific versions or URLs, so I'll note that as empty fields.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the metadata vocabulary provided.
