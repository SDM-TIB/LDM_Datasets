Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper focuses on early rumour detection using Twitter and Weibo datasets. 

In the introduction, the authors mention using Twitter and Weibo datasets for their experiments. They reference Ma et al. (2016) and Zubiga et al. (2016) for these datasets. 

Moving to the methodology section, they describe their experiments on WEIBO and TWITTER datasets. The statistics table (Table 1) provides details about the number of posts, events, rumours, etc., for both datasets.

In the experiment section (4.1), they explicitly state that they use two datasets: WEIBO and TWITTER, developed by Ma et al. (2016) and Zubiga et al. (2016) respectively. 

I should note the creators, descriptions, titles, and other metadata for each dataset. 

For WEIBO:
- Created by Ma et al. (2016)
- Description: A dataset for rumour detection on Weibo, focusing on microblog data.
- Title: Weibo Rumour Dataset
- Issued year: 2016
- Language: Chinese
- Format: Text
- Theme: Social Media, Rumour Detection
- Keywords: Rumour detection, Weibo, Microblogs
- Tasks: Rumour detection

For TWITTER:
- Created by Zubiga et al. (2016)
- Description: A dataset for rumour detection on Twitter, focusing on microblog data.
- Title: Twitter Rumour Dataset
- Issued year: 2016
- Language: English
- Format: Text
- Theme: Social Media, Rumour Detection
- Keywords: Rumour detection, Twitter, Microblogs
- Tasks: Rumour detection

I need to ensure that the creators are correctly identified from the references. Ma et al. (2016) and Zubiga et al. (2016) are the creators of the respective datasets.

Now, I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring all metadata fields are filled appropriately.
