Alright, I'm looking at the provided paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper is about a study using DeBERTa for identifying plausible clarifications in instructional texts. 

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction. The introduction mentions WikiHow as the source of instructional articles. WikiHow is a how-to website with articles, but it's not a dataset per se. However, the paper refers to SemEval-2022 Task 7, which is a dataset used for evaluating NLP systems in distinguishing plausible clarifications.

Looking further, the paper details their experiments using SemEval-2022 Task 7 data. This dataset includes articles from WikiHow, with contexts and possible filler options labeled as plausible, neutral, or implausible. The authors used this dataset for their multi-class classification task.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned beyond SemEval-2022 Task 7. WikiHow is the source of the articles but isn't a dataset in the traditional sense. The key dataset here is SemEval-2022 Task 7, which is specifically used for evaluating plausibility detection in clarifications.

So, the only dataset to extract is SemEval-2022 Task 7. I'll gather the metadata for this dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
