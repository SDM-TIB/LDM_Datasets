Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "YZU-NLP Team at SemEval-2016 Task 4: Ordinal Sentiment Classification Using a Recurrent Convolutional Network." It discusses sentiment analysis of tweets, specifically using a five-point scale for ordinal classification.

Looking through the sections:

1. **Abstract**: Mentions the use of SemEval-2016 Task 4 datasets for sentiment classification.

2. **Introduction**: Talks about sentiment analysis in general but doesn't mention specific datasets beyond the SemEval task.

3. **Methodology**: Describes the use of word embeddings from GloVe and an additional dataset from the Vader corpus.

4. **Experiments and Evaluation**: Details the SemEval-2016 Task 4 datasets, including gold training, gold development, and gold development-test datasets. Also mentions the Vader corpus.

5. **References**: Lists several datasets, including GloVe and Vader.

From this, the datasets mentioned are:

- **SemEval-2016 Task 4**: Used for sentiment classification.
- **GloVe**: Pre-trained word vectors used for word embeddings.
- **Vader corpus**: Additional dataset for training word embeddings.

Now, I'll extract metadata for each dataset based on the provided vocabulary.
