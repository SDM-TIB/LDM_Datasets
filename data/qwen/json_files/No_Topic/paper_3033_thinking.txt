Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Adapting Predicate Frames for Urdu PropBanking" and discusses the creation of predicate frames for Urdu PropBanking by adapting frames from Hindi and Arabic PropBanks. It also mentions the use of a classifier to identify the origin of Urdu vocabulary.

Looking through the sections, I notice that the paper references several resources and datasets:

1. **Hindi PropBank**: This is mentioned in the context of adapting frames for Urdu. The paper discusses how the Hindi PropBank's frame files are used to create Urdu frames.

2. **Arabic PropBank**: Similarly, the paper uses the Arabic PropBank to adapt frames for Urdu, especially for predicates of Arabic origin.

3. **Urdu Treebank**: The paper refers to the Urdu treebank, which is used to identify the source of Urdu vocabulary and to create predicate frames.

4. **Online Urdu Dictionary (OUD)**: This is used to prepare etymological data for classifying the origin of Urdu words.

Now, I need to extract metadata for each of these datasets.

For the **Hindi PropBank**, the creators are Martha Palmer and her team. The description is about the Hindi PropBank's frame files. The title is "Hindi PropBank". It was published in 2008. The language is Hindi. The identifier is the URL provided in the references. The theme is "Natural Language Processing". Keywords include "Predicate frames", "Hindi", "PropBank". The landing page is the URL. The format is "Text". The task is "Predicate Frame Adaptation".

For the **Arabic PropBank**, the creators are Martha Palmer and her team. The description is about adapting frames from the Arabic PropBank. The title is "Arabic PropBank". Published in 2008. Language is Arabic. Identifier is the URL. Theme is "Natural Language Processing". Keywords include "Predicate frames", "Arabic", "PropBank". Landing page is the URL. Format is "Text". Task is "Predicate Frame Adaptation".

The **Urdu Treebank** is created by the authors of the paper. The description is about the Urdu treebank used for creating predicate frames. The title is "Urdu Treebank". Published in 2012. Language is Urdu. Identifier is the URL. Theme is "Natural Language Processing". Keywords include "Treebank", "Urdu", "Predicate frames". Landing page is the URL. Format is "Text". Task is "Predicate Frame Creation".

The **Online Urdu Dictionary (OUD)** is created by the e-government Directorate of Pakistan. The description is about using OUD for etymological data. The title is "Online Urdu Dictionary". Published in 2012. Language is Urdu. Identifier is the URL. Theme is "Lexical Resources". Keywords include "Dictionary", "Urdu", "Etymology". Landing page is the URL. Format is "Text". Task is "Word Origin Classification".

I need to ensure that each dataset's metadata is accurately captured based on the information provided in the paper.
