Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images based on a modified DarkCovidNet model." It discusses the use of chest X-ray images for COVID-19 detection using a modified CNN model.

In the methodology section, the authors mention that they collected over 10,000 X-ray images. They reference several sources for their dataset:

1. **COVID-19 X-ray Image Database by Cohen JP**: This dataset contains X-ray images of COVID-19 cases.
2. **COVID-19 Radiography Database**: This dataset includes images of COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia cases.
3. **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)**: This dataset is used for normal and pneumonia cases.

I need to extract metadata for each of these datasets. Let me go through each one.

For the **COVID-19 X-ray Image Database by Cohen JP**, the creators are listed as the authors of the dataset. The description mentions it's a database of COVID-19 X-ray images. The title is straightforward. The issued year isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll leave it empty. The language isn't specified, so it's empty. The identifier is the GitHub URL. The theme is medical imaging. Keywords include COVID-19, X-ray, and chest imaging. The landing page is the GitHub URL. No version is mentioned, so it's empty. The format is images. The task is COVID-19 detection.

Next, the **COVID-19 Radiography Database** is cited as another source. The creators are the authors of this dataset. The description includes COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia images. The title is clear. The issued year isn't provided. The language isn't specified. The identifier is the Kaggle URL. The theme is medical imaging. Keywords are similar to the first dataset. The landing page is the Kaggle URL. No version is mentioned. The format is images. The task is COVID-19 detection.

Lastly, the **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)** dataset is referenced. The creators are the authors of this dataset. The description focuses on normal and pneumonia cases. The title is straightforward. The issued year isn't provided. The language isn't specified. The identifier is the GitHub URL. The theme is medical imaging. Keywords include pneumonia, X-ray, and chest imaging. The landing page is the GitHub URL. No version is mentioned. The format is images. The task is pneumonia detection.

I need to ensure that each dataset is correctly attributed with the right metadata. I'll structure each dataset as a JSON object with the specified fields.
