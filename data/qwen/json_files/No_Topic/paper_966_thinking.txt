Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses the use of external corpora for the 2013 NLI shared task. It mentions several corpora, including TOEFL-11, ICLE, Lang-8, FCE, ICCI, ICANLE, and others.

Looking at the sections, Section 4 specifically details the external corpora used. The corpora mentioned are:

1. **TOEFL-11**: Used for the shared task, focusing on non-native English texts.
2. **ICLE (International Corpus of Learner English)**: A corpus of college student essays.
3. **Lang-8**: A corpus of journal entries from language learners.
4. **FCE (First Certificate in English)**: A small sample from the Cambridge Learner Corpus.
5. **ICCI (International Corpus of Crosslinguistic Interlanguage)**: Essays from young learners.
6. **ICANLE (International Corpus Network of Asian Learners of English)**: Essays from Asian college students.
7. **Indian Corpora**: Includes news, Twitter, and blogs in Hindi and Telugu.

Each of these corpora is described in the paper, so I'll extract their metadata based on the information provided.

For each dataset, I'll identify the creator, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

I'll ensure that the creators are correctly identified from the references or context. If the creator isn't explicitly mentioned, I'll leave it as an empty list. The description will be based on how the paper uses or describes each corpus. The themes and keywords will reflect the nature of the data and its use in the paper.

Finally, I'll compile all this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately represented.
