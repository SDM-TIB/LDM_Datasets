Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about the MaCoCu project, which focuses on collecting and curating monolingual and bilingual data for under-resourced European languages. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to understand the context. The project aims to build large corpora for languages like Maltese, Bulgarian, Slovenian, Croatian, Icelandic, Turkish, Albanian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, and Serbian. They mention using a web crawling approach and a curation pipeline.

Looking for specific datasets, I notice references to Paracrawl and Oscar. Paracrawl is cited in the introduction as a related initiative, and Oscar is mentioned as another existing resource. These are likely datasets used or compared against in the project.

Next, I check the references section for more details. Paracrawl is cited with authors including BaEnAon et al., and Oscar is cited with Abadji et al. These references provide the creators, titles, and publication years of the datasets.

I also look for any other datasets mentioned, but the paper primarily focuses on their own project's corpora, which aren't explicitly named as separate datasets beyond the languages they cover. Therefore, the main datasets extracted are Paracrawl and Oscar.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information found. Paracrawl is a web-scale parallel corpus, and Oscar is a document-oriented multilingual corpus. Their creators, descriptions, and publication years are extracted from the references.

Finally, I'll format this information into the required JSON structure, ensuring all specified metadata fields are included accurately.
