Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "CI-AVSR: A Cantonese Audio-Visual Speech Dataset for In-car Command Recognition" and it's authored by several researchers from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. 

First, I'll read through the abstract to get an overview. The abstract mentions the creation of a new dataset called CI-AVSR, which stands for Cantonese In-car Audio-Visual Speech Recognition. It's a multimodal dataset with both audio and video data, containing 4,984 samples of 200 in-car commands recorded by 30 native Cantonese speakers. They also augmented this dataset with common in-car background noises, making it 10 times larger.

Next, I'll look into the introduction and related work sections to see if any other datasets are mentioned. The introduction talks about the challenges in building ASR systems for low-resource languages and mentions the use of audio-visual speech recognition. It references datasets like LRS2-BBC and MuSe-CaR, but these are not the focus of the current paper. The paper's main contribution is the CI-AVSR dataset.

In the dataset collection and statistics section, the authors describe how they created the CI-AVSR dataset. They mention using a dedicated website for data recording, ensuring high-quality audio and video. They also detail the augmentation process with 10 types of background noises, which are downloaded from freesound.org. However, these noises aren't datasets themselves but are used to enhance the CI-AVSR dataset.

The experiments section evaluates the CI-AVSR dataset using two baseline models, showing the effectiveness of audio-visual speech recognition. The results highlight the dataset's utility in improving ASR performance under noisy conditions.

Throughout the paper, the only dataset explicitly mentioned and described in detail is CI-AVSR. Other datasets like LRS2-BBC and MuSe-CaR are referenced in the related work but aren't the focus here. The authors don't mention any other datasets they used or created beyond CI-AVSR.

So, the main dataset to extract is CI-AVSR. I'll gather the metadata as per the instructions: the creators are the authors of the paper, the description is based on the dataset's purpose and contents, the title is CI-AVSR, the issued year is 2022 (since the paper was published in 2022), the language is Cantonese, the identifier is the GitHub URL provided, the theme is audio-visual speech recognition, the keywords include Cantonese, in-car commands, etc., the landing page is the GitHub URL, the format is audio and video, and the task is speech recognition.

I need to ensure that all the metadata fields are correctly filled based on the information provided in the paper. The creators are the authors listed in the paper, the description is a concise summary of the dataset, and the other fields are filled accordingly.
