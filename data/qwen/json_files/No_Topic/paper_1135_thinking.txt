Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Google Books N-gram Corpus used as a Grammar Checker" by Rogelio Nazar and Irene Renau. The abstract mentions the use of the Google Books N-gram Corpus for detecting and correcting grammatical errors. 

In the introduction, the authors elaborate on their methodology, stating that they used the Google Books N-gram Corpus, compiled by Michel et al. (2011). This corpus is described as containing n-grams of sequences up to 5 words, recording frequency distributions from 1500 onwards, with a focus on data starting from 1970.

The paper also references other datasets, such as the CEDEL2 corpus, which is a corpus of essays in Spanish written by non-native speakers. This dataset is used for testing the grammar checker's performance on real errors made by learners.

Additionally, the authors mention the use of a Spanish grammar book by MontolA Ao (2000) as a source for exercises, though this is more of a resource than a dataset.

I should structure the datasets as per the metadata vocabulary provided. The main dataset is the Google Books N-gram Corpus, and the secondary one is the CEDEL2 corpus.

For each dataset, I'll extract the required fields:

1. **Google Books N-gram Corpus**:
   - Creator: Michel et al. (2011)
   - Description: Large n-gram corpus used for detecting grammatical errors.
   - Title: Google Books N-gram Corpus
   - Issued: 2011
   - Language: Spanish (as per the paper's focus)
   - Identifier: Not provided in the paper.
   - Theme: Computational Linguistics, Grammar Checking
   - Keywords: N-gram, Corpus, Grammar, Spanish
   - Landing Page: Not provided.
   - Version: Not mentioned.
   - Format: Text
   - Task: Grammar Checking, Error Detection

2. **CEDEL2 Corpus**:
   - Creator: Lozano (2009)
   - Description: Corpus of essays by non-native Spanish speakers.
   - Title: CEDEL2 Corpus
   - Issued: 2009
   - Language: Spanish
   - Identifier: Not provided.
   - Theme: Language Learning, Error Analysis
   - Keywords: Non-native, Essays, Spanish
   - Landing Page: Not provided.
   - Version: Not mentioned.
   - Format: Text
   - Task: Error Detection, Grammar Checking

I need to ensure that the creators are correctly identified as the authors of the datasets, not the paper's authors. The Google Books N-gram Corpus is created by Michel et al., and CEDEL2 by Lozano.

Now, I'll format this information into the required JSON structure.
