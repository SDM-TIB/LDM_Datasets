Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses HDR and HFR video reconstruction using RMB spikings. It mentions datasets used for experiments, including synthetic and real-synthetic data.

Looking into the experiments section, the authors conducted tests on synthetic data and real-synthetic data. They also reference datasets from other works, like GC20 and MG20, which are used for comparison.

I need to identify each dataset, extract the required metadata, and format them into JSON. For each dataset, I'll note the creators, description, title, publication year, keywords, and other relevant details.

I'll make sure to only include datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper and avoid any assumptions about datasets not referenced here.
