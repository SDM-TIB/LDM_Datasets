Alright, I'm looking at the provided research paper to identify all the datasets mentioned. The paper is about a dataset called ViQuAE, which stands for Visual Question Answering about Named Entities. 

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to understand the context. The paper mentions that ViQuAE is a new dataset with 3,700 questions paired with images. It's the first of its kind to cover a wide range of entity types and uses a knowledge base of 1.5 million Wikipedia articles. 

Next, I'll check the references section to see if any other datasets are cited. I notice that the paper references TriviaQA, which is another dataset used for question answering. TriviaQA is mentioned as a source for generating questions and answers. 

I'll also look for any other datasets mentioned in the methodology or experiments. The paper uses Wikipedia as a knowledge base, but since it's a general resource and not a specific dataset, it might not qualify. However, the 1.5 million Wikipedia articles are part of the ViQuAE dataset's construction, so they are integral to it.

So, the main datasets identified are ViQuAE and TriviaQA. I'll extract the metadata for each based on the information provided in the paper.
