Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Simultaneous Object Detection and Ranking with Weak Supervision" by Matthew B. Blaschko, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman. It discusses their approach to object detection using weak supervision and evaluates their method on two datasets.

In the abstract, they mention using the INRIA pedestrian detection dataset and the PASCAL VOC dataset. These are the primary datasets they used for their experiments.

Looking into the introduction, they reference the INRIA dataset for pedestrian detection and the PASCAL VOC dataset for object detection tasks. The INRIA dataset is known for its use in pedestrian detection research, while PASCAL VOC is a well-known benchmark for object detection and image segmentation.

In the results section, they provide detailed results on the PASCAL VOC dataset, specifically mentioning the cat class as a test case. They also discuss their performance on the INRIA pedestrian dataset, comparing it to state-of-the-art results.

I should check the references for more details on these datasets. The INRIA dataset is cited as [14], and PASCAL VOC is cited as [17]. From the references, I can gather the creators, publication years, and other details.

For the INRIA pedestrian detection dataset, the creators are N. Dalal and B. Triggs, published in 2005. It's a video dataset used for pedestrian detection, containing images with annotations for pedestrians.

The PASCAL VOC dataset, created by Everingham et al., was published in 2010. It's an image dataset used for object detection and segmentation, containing various object classes with bounding box annotations.

I need to structure this information into the required JSON format, including all the specified metadata fields for each dataset.
