Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Population Matching Discrepancy and Applications in Deep Learning" by Jianfei Chen, Chongxuan Li, Yizhong Ru, and Jun Zhu. It discusses the use of Population Matching Discrepancy (PMD) in deep learning tasks, specifically domain adaptation and generative modeling.

Looking through the sections, I find that the authors mention several datasets in their experiments:

1. **Ofice Dataset**: This is a benchmark dataset for domain adaptation, containing three domains: amazon, dslr, and webcam. It's used to evaluate the performance of PMD in domain adaptation tasks.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, used for generative modeling experiments.

3. **SVHN Dataset**: The Street View House Numbers dataset, used for evaluating generative models.

4. **LFW Dataset**: The Labelled Faces in the Wild dataset, used for face recognition tasks and generative modeling.

I also check the references section to find more details about these datasets. However, the paper doesn't provide specific DOIs or URLs for these datasets, so those fields will remain empty.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the specified metadata vocabulary.
