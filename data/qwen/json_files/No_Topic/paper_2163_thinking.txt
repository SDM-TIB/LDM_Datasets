Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Stacked Ensembles of Information Extractors for Knowledge-Base Population" by Nazneen Fatema Rajani and others. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to understand the context. The paper discusses using stacking to ensemble multiple systems for the KBP-ESF task. They mention using data from the 2013 and 2014 KBP-ESF competitions. 

Looking into the methodology, they refer to the KBP-ESF task, which involves slot filling. They mention the 2013 and 2014 datasets used for training and testing their stacking approach. These datasets are part of the TAC KBP evaluations. 

I'll check the references section to find more details about these datasets. The references include works by Surdeanu, Wang, Yu, and others, which are related to the KBP-ESF tasks. 

From the paper, it's clear that the datasets used are from the TAC KBP evaluations, specifically the 2013 and 2014 English Slot Filling (ESF) tasks. These datasets are used to train and test their ensembling approach. 

I need to structure this information into the required JSON format, including creators, descriptions, titles, and other metadata as specified.
