Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about a new dialogue representation called ThingTalk+ and a sample-efficient methodology for Wizard-of-Oz dialogues. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. I notice that the paper references MultiWOZ 3.0, which is a reannotation of the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset. The authors mention that they reannotated parts of MultiWOZ 2.1 to create MultiWOZ 3.0 using ThingTalk+.

Next, I need to gather metadata for these datasets. For MultiWOZ 3.0, the creators are the authors of the paper, but since the dataset is a reannotation, I should check if there's a specific citation. The paper doesn't provide a DOI or URL for MultiWOZ 3.0, so I'll leave those fields empty. The description should reflect that it's a reannotated version focusing on precise dialogue states. The language is English, and the format is text. The themes are task-oriented dialogue and natural language processing, with keywords like Wizard-of-Oz, dialogue state tracking, and semantic parsing.

For MultiWOZ 2.1, the creators are listed in the references as Mihail Eric et al. The description mentions it's a multi-domain dataset with corrections. The language is English, and the format is text. The themes and keywords are similar to MultiWOZ 3.0.

I'll structure this information into JSON format, ensuring each dataset has the required metadata fields. Since the paper doesn't provide DOIs or URLs for these datasets, those fields will be empty. The versions are specified as 3.0 and 2.1 respectively.
