Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper's title is "PTB Graph Parsing with Tree Approximation" by Yoshihide Kato and Shigeki Matsubara. The abstract mentions the Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset. The introduction also refers to PTB, specifically the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993). 

Looking through the sections, the paper discusses PTB graphs and their conversion into trees. The experimental section mentions using the PTB for evaluation, specifically sections 02a21 for training, section 22 for development, and section 23 for testing. 

I should check the references for more details on PTB. The reference by Marcus et al., 1993, describes the Penn Treebank as a large annotated corpus of English text, which is widely used in NLP research.

Since PTB is the only dataset mentioned, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, including the creators, description, title, year, and other relevant metadata.
