Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Less is More: Attention Supervision with Counterfactuals for Text Classification" by Seungtaek Choi and others. It discusses their approach to attention supervision using counterfactuals and evaluates their method on several datasets.

Looking through the sections, I find that the datasets are mentioned in the "4 Experiment Setup" section. Specifically, the datasets used are:

1. **SST2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis, containing around 11K sentences. The paper mentions that they dichotomize the sentences into positive and negative classes.

2. **IMDB**: The IMDB Large Movie Review Corpus is used for binary sentiment classification, containing 50K reviews split into training and testing sets.

3. **20NG (20 Newsgroups)**: This dataset is used for news categorization, with around 19K documents. The paper extracts samples from the baseball and hockey categories for a binary classification task.

I also check the references section to find more details about these datasets. However, the paper doesn't provide DOIs or URLs for these datasets, so those fields will remain empty.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the specified metadata vocabulary.
