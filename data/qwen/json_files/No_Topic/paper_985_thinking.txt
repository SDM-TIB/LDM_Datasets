Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses debiasing pre-trained text encoders by focusing on attention mechanisms. It mentions several datasets used for evaluation.

Looking at the Related Work section, I see references to StereoSet and Crows-Pairs. These are datasets used for measuring bias in text encoders. I'll note these down.

In the Evaluation section, the authors mention using GLUE benchmark tasks for assessing semantic preservation. GLUE is a collection of tasks, but it's considered a dataset in this context.

The paper also references the News-commentary-v15 corpus, which is used for training the text encoders. This is another dataset to include.

Additionally, the authors mention the HateXplain dataset, which is used for evaluating hate speech detection. This is another dataset to extract.

Now, I'll gather the details for each dataset:

1. **StereoSet**: Created by Nadeem et al. in 2020, it's used for measuring bias in sentence representations. The description includes its structure and purpose.

2. **Crows-Pairs**: Developed by Nangia et al. in 2020, it's used for likelihood-based bias evaluation. The description covers its structure and usage.

3. **GLUE Benchmark**: Introduced by Wang et al. in 2018, it's a collection of tasks for evaluating language understanding. The description includes its purpose and tasks.

4. **News-commentary-v15**: Used for training, it's a corpus of news commentary texts. The description focuses on its role in the study.

5. **HateXplain**: Created by Mathew et al. in 2021, it's used for hate speech detection evaluation. The description includes its purpose and structure.

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata fields based on the information provided in the paper. If some details aren't explicitly mentioned, I'll leave them as empty strings or lists.

Finally, I'll structure the information into JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described according to the specified vocabulary.
