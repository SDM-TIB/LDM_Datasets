Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is titled "Fixed That for You: Generating Contrastive Claims with Semantic Edits" by Christopher Hidey and Kathleen McKeown from Columbia University. 

First, I'll read through the abstract to get a quick overview. It mentions that they created a corpus of Reddit comment pairs labeled with FTFY (Fixed That For You). So, that's one dataset: the Reddit FTFY corpus.

Next, I'll look into the introduction and methodology sections. They describe how they collected data from Reddit using the FTFY acronym, resulting in 1,083,520 comment pairs. They also mention a crowd-labeled set of 2,625 comments, each paired with 5 new contrastive responses. This is another dataset, likely the Mechanical Turk (AMT) dataset.

I'll check the references to see if these datasets are cited elsewhere, but the paper doesn't provide external references for these datasets. They seem to be internally created for this study.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset. For the Reddit FTFY corpus, the creators are the authors of the paper. The description is based on how they used it in their research. The title is straightforward. The issued year isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll leave it empty. The language is English, and the format is text. The themes are social media and argumentation, with keywords like Reddit, FTFY, and contrastive claims.

For the Mechanical Turk dataset, the creators are the same authors. The description is about the crowd-labeled comments. The title is the AMT dataset. The language is English, and the format is text. The themes are similar, with keywords focusing on crowd-sourcing and contrastive claims.

I'll make sure each dataset has all the required fields, even if some are empty. I'll avoid adding any extra information not mentioned in the paper.
