Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about the use of cross-entropy loss leading to poor margins in neural networks, and it mentions several datasets. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. I notice that the paper references the CIFAR-10 dataset in the context of experiments with a convolutional neural network. Specifically, it mentions classifying horses and planes from the CIFAR-10 dataset. 

Next, I need to gather metadata about CIFAR-10. The creators are Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E. Hinton. The description should reflect how the paper uses it, which is for classifying images into two classes (horses and planes). The title is "CIFAR-10". It was published in 2010. The language is English since it's an image dataset. The identifier is the URL provided in the references. The theme is Computer Vision. Keywords include image classification, machine learning, and neural networks. The landing page is the official CIFAR website. The format is image. The task is image classification.

I also check if there are any other datasets mentioned, but it seems CIFAR-10 is the only one referenced in the paper. So, I'll structure this information into the required JSON format.
