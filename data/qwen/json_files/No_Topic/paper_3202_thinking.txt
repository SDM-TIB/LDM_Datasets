Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about transition-based parsing for deep dependency structures. Let me go through the paper step by step to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction. The abstract mentions that experiments are conducted on CCG-grounded functor-argument analysis, LFG-grounded grammatical relation analysis, and HPSG-grounded semantic dependency analysis for English and Chinese. So, these are the datasets used.

Next, I'll check the references section to find more details about these datasets. The paper cites several sources, including:

1. **CCGBank**: This is a corpus of CCG derivations and dependency structures extracted from the Penn Treebank. It's used for English and Chinese parsing experiments.

2. **GRBank**: This is a Chinese grammatical relation corpus used for experiments.

3. **DeepBank**: This is a corpus derived from the Wall Street Journal, providing dependency structures based on HPSG.

4. **EnjuBank**: This is another corpus for semantic dependency parsing, derived from the Penn Treebank.

5. **PropBank**: This is a corpus used for propositional semantic analysis, though it's mentioned in the context of comparison rather than direct use.

6. **SemEval 2014 Task 8**: This is a shared task dataset for semantic dependency parsing.

I'll need to gather the creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, languages, identifiers, themes, keywords, landing pages, versions, formats, and tasks for each of these datasets based on the information provided in the paper.

For example, CCGBank is created by Hockenmaier and Steedman (2007) and Tse and Curran (2010). It's used for English and Chinese parsing experiments, focusing on CCG derivations and dependency structures.

Similarly, DeepBank is created by Flickinger, Zhang, and Kordoni (2012) and is used for HPSG-based semantic dependency analysis.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring accuracy based on the paper's references and descriptions.
