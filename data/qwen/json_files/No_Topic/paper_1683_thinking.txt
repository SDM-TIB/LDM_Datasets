Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract to get an overview. It mentions using a large public dataset for experiments, but doesn't name it yet. Moving on to the introduction, the authors discuss neuro-imaging and mention fMRI data. They reference the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset in section 5. 

In section 5, they detail their experiments using task fMRI data from 500 subjects from the HCP dataset. This dataset is specifically mentioned for its use in functional brain mapping tasks. The authors also refer to the HCP's behavioral data, which includes variables like IQ and reading proficiency.

Looking through the references, the HCP dataset is cited as [20], providing more context about its use in their research. The dataset is described as containing full-brain Z-score maps and is used for learning structured dictionaries to capture inter-subject variability.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The focus is on the HCP dataset and its application in their experiments. Therefore, the only dataset extracted is the Human Connectome Project dataset.
