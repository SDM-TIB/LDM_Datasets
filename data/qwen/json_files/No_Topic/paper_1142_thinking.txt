Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract talks about event detection and few-shot learning, but doesn't mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses event extraction and mentions ACE 2005, which is a dataset. So, ACE 2005 is one dataset.

Next, I'll check the methodology section. The authors mention using the FewEvent corpus for their experiments. This is another dataset. They also reference other works that use datasets like ACE 2005 and FewEvent, but I need to focus on datasets explicitly mentioned in this paper.

Looking further, the authors discuss their experiments on the FewEvent corpus, which is specifically used for few-shot event detection. They also mention ACE 2005 in the context of previous work on event detection.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The references section lists several papers, but I'm only interested in datasets explicitly used in this study.

So, the datasets identified are ACE 2005 and FewEvent. I'll extract their metadata based on the information provided in the paper.
