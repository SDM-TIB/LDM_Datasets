Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Sub-word information in pre-trained biomedical word representations: evaluation and hyper-parameter optimization" by Dieter Galea, Ivan Laponogov, and Kirill Veselkov. 

First, I'll start by reading through the abstract to get a general idea of what the paper is about. The abstract mentions that the authors are evaluating and optimizing pre-trained biomedical word representations, specifically looking at sub-word information. They mention using various datasets for evaluation, but I need to find the specific names of these datasets.

Next, I'll move on to the introduction. Here, the authors discuss the limitations of word2vec and the importance of character-based representations like fastText. They hint at evaluating these models on different datasets, but again, I need to look for specific names.

In the materials and methods section, I'll focus on the subsections detailing the datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention three named entity recognition corpora:

1. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: This dataset is used for gene recognition tasks.
2. **JNLPBA corpus**: This corpus annotates proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
3. **CHEMDNER corpus**: This dataset focuses on annotating drugs and chemicals.

In the results section, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, reinforcing their relevance.

Now, I'll check the references section to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **BC2GM**, the citation is:
  > Larry Smith, Lorraine K Tanabe, Rie Johnson nee Ando, Cheng-Ju Kuo, I-Fang Chung, Chun-Nan Hsu, Yu-Shi Lin, Roman Klinger, Christoph M Friedrich, Kuzman Ganchev, et al. *Overview of biocreative ii gene mention recognition*. Genome biology, 9(Suppl 2):1–19, 2008. https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2008-9-s2-s2

- For **JNLPBA**, the citation is:
  > Jin-Dong Kim, Tomoko Ohta, Yoshimasa Tsuruoka, Yuka Tateisi, and Nigel Collier. *Introduction to the bio-entity recognition task at JNLPBA*. In Proceedings of the 2004 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), pages 70–75, 2004. http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-1213

- For **CHEMDNER**, the citation is:
  > Martin Krallinger, Florian Leitner, Obdulia Rabal, Miguel Vazquez, Julen Oyarzabal, and Alfonso Valencia. *CHEMDNER: The drugs and chemical names extraction challenge*. Journal of Cheminformatics, 7(Suppl 1):S1, 2015. https://doi.org/10.1186/1758-2946-7-S1-S1

After gathering this information, I'll compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
