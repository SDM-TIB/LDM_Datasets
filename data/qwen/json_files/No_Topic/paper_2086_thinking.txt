Alright, I'm trying to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Masked Latent Semantic Modeling: an Efficient Pre-training Alternative to Masked Language Modeling" by GÃ¡bor Berend from the University of Szeged. The paper discusses an alternative pre-training method for language models called MLSM (Masked Latent Semantic Modeling). 

First, I'll go through the paper section by section to identify any datasets mentioned. 

In the **Abstract**, the paper doesn't mention any specific datasets. It's more about the methodology and results.

Moving to the **Introduction**, the authors reference WordNet and ConceptNet as semantic resources. These are datasets used for semantic information. 

In the **Related Work** section, they mention SenseBERT, which relies on WordNet. Again, WordNet is a dataset used here.

In the **Methodology** section, the authors discuss using sparse coding and reference SEMCOR, which is another dataset. SEMCOR is a semantically annotated corpus of English text.

In the **Experiments** section, they mention using the WikiBERT pipeline for preprocessing Wikipedia data. This indicates that they used Wikipedia as a dataset for pre-training their models.

They also evaluate their models on several benchmark datasets, including:
- CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability)
- CoNLL 2003 (for Named Entity Recognition)
- MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)
- MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus)
- QNLI (Question NLI)
- QQP (Quora Question Pairs)
- RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment)
- SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)
- STS-B (Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark)
- WiC (Word-in-Context)

These datasets are all part of the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks, which are collections of datasets used for evaluating language models.

Additionally, the authors mention using BERT and RoBERTa models, which are pre-trained on large corpora, but these are models, not datasets.

So, compiling all the datasets mentioned:
1. WordNet
2. ConceptNet
3. SEMCOR
4. Wikipedia (via WikiBERT)
5. CoLA
6. CoNLL 2003
7. MNLI
8. MRPC
9. QNLI
10. QQP
11. RTE
12. SST-2
13. STS-B
14. WiC

Each of these datasets is used for different purposes, such as semantic modeling, pre-training, and evaluation.
