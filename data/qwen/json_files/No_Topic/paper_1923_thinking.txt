Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract talks about word embeddings and using dictionary definitions, but doesn't mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses word embeddings and their applications, again without specific datasets.

Moving on to the sections, I see that the paper mentions WordNet in the experiments section. WordNet is a well-known lexical database. The authors used WordNet's deinitions and synonym sets for training and evaluation. 

In the experiments, they split WordNet into train, validation, and test sets. They also mention using benchmarks like SimVerb3500, MEN, RG, WS353, SCWS, and MTurk for evaluation. These are standard datasets for evaluating word embeddings.

Additionally, the authors reference other datasets used in related work, such as dict2vec and retroitting, but these are methods rather than datasets. The primary dataset used in their experiments is WordNet.

I should also check the references for any other datasets, but the paper doesn't list additional datasets beyond WordNet and the evaluation benchmarks.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. WordNet
2. SimVerb3500
3. MEN
4. RG
5. WS353
6. SCWS
7. MTurk

Each of these will need to be described using the specified metadata vocabulary.
