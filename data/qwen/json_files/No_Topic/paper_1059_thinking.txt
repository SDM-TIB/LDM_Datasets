Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses a clause attention model (CA) for handling long sentences in NER and NMT tasks. It mentions datasets used for evaluation.

Looking at the sections, the "Experiment" section details the datasets used. Specifically, the paper evaluates CA on CoNLL-2003 for NER and NiuTrans English-Chinese for NMT. Additionally, it provides results on WMT16 English-German and WMT15 English-Vietnamese tasks.

Now, I'll identify each dataset:

1. **CoNLL-2003**: This is a well-known dataset for NER tasks, containing English text with named entity annotations. The paper uses it to evaluate signal word training and NER performance.

2. **NiuTrans English-Chinese**: This dataset is used for NMT evaluation, focusing on translating between English and Chinese. The paper provides translation results and comparisons.

3. **WMT16 English-German**: Part of the WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation) datasets, this is used for evaluating machine translation quality between English and German.

4. **WMT15 English-Vietnamese**: Another WMT dataset, used for evaluating translation between English and Vietnamese.

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata:

- **dcterms:creator**: The authors or creators of the dataset. For CoNLL-2003, it's the CoNLL organizers. NiuTrans is created by its developers, and WMT datasets are organized by the WMT workshop.

- **dcterms:description**: A brief description based on how the paper uses the dataset. For example, CoNLL-2003 is used for NER evaluation.

- **dcterms:title**: The name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.

- **dcterms:issued**: The year the dataset was published. CoNLL-2003 was released in 2003, NiuTrans in 2020, and WMT datasets in 2015 and 2016.

- **dcterms:language**: The languages involved. CoNLL-2003 is English, NiuTrans is English-Chinese, and WMT datasets are English-German and English-Vietnamese.

- **dcterms:identifier**: DOI or URL if available. The paper doesn't provide specific DOIs, so this field remains empty.

- **dcat:theme**: Thematic categories like NER, NMT, etc.

- **dcat:keyword**: Keywords related to the dataset's use, such as "NER," "NMT," "translation."

- **dcat:landingPage**: URLs if available. The paper doesn't provide specific URLs, so this is empty.

- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Specific versions if mentioned. The paper doesn't specify versions, so this is empty.

- **dcterms:format**: Format of the data, typically text for NER and NMT datasets.

- **mls:task**: Tasks the dataset is used for, such as NER or machine translation.

I'll structure each dataset into a JSON object with the above fields. Since the paper doesn't provide DOIs or URLs, those fields will be empty. The creators are inferred from the dataset's origin, and the descriptions are based on the paper's usage.

Finally, I'll compile all datasets into a JSON array, ensuring each entry is correctly formatted and all required fields are included, even if some are empty strings or lists.
