Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

The paper is titled "PAIGE: PAirwise Image Geometry Encoding for Improved Efficiency in Structure-from-Motion" by Johannes L. Sch√§onberger, Alexander C. Berg, and Jan-Michael Frahm. It discusses methods for improving the efficiency of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) systems, particularly focusing on the pairwise image matching stage.

Looking through the paper, I find that the authors evaluate their methods on several datasets. Specifically, in Section 3, they mention datasets such as London Eye, San Marco, Tate Modern, Time Square, Trafalgar, and Rome. These datasets are used to evaluate the performance of different matching techniques.

Each of these datasets is a collection of images, likely from different landmarks, used to test the SfM algorithms. The authors use these datasets to measure the performance of their PAIGE method against other existing approaches.

Now, I need to extract metadata for each dataset. However, the paper doesn't provide detailed information about the creators, descriptions, or other metadata for these datasets beyond their names and usage in the evaluation. Therefore, I'll have to infer some details based on their context.

For example, the London Eye dataset is likely a collection of images of the London Eye monument, used to test how well the SfM algorithm can reconstruct the 3D structure from these images. Similarly, the Rome dataset is probably a collection of images from various landmarks in Rome.

Since the paper doesn't provide specific details like creators, publication dates, or URLs, I'll leave those fields empty or mark them as not found. The themes and keywords can be inferred based on the context of the datasets being used for SfM evaluations.

Finally, I'll structure each dataset's metadata according to the specified vocabulary, ensuring that each field is appropriately filled based on the information available in the paper.
