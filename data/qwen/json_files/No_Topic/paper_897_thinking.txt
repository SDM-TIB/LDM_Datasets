Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The abstract mentions using "multiple standard datasets" but doesn't name them. Moving on to the introduction, I see references to image classification frameworks and various encoding techniques, but no specific datasets yet.

In the related work section, the authors discuss different encoding methods and mention datasets like Caltech-101, Caltech-256, Pascal VOC 2007, and MIT Scenes. These are likely the datasets used in their experiments.

Looking further into the experiments section, the authors provide detailed results on these datasets. For example, they mention Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 for classification accuracy, Pascal VOC 2007 for mean average precision, and MIT Scenes for scene classification.

I should also check the references section for any additional datasets. Scanning through the references, I find citations for these datasets, confirming their use in the paper.

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields. For each dataset, I'll note the creators, description, title, publication year, themes, keywords, and tasks they were used for.

Finally, I'll compile this information into a JSON format, ensuring all fields are correctly filled based on the paper's content.
