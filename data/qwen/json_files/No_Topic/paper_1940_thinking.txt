Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "An Annotated Corpus for Sentiment Analysis in Political News" and is authored by Gabriel Domingos de Arruda, Norton Trevisan Roman, and Ana Maria Monteiro. The abstract mentions the creation of a corpus of news texts in Brazilian Portuguese, which is annotated for sentiment analysis. This corpus is one dataset.

Looking further into the paper, the authors mention several related works and existing datasets. In the Related Work section, they reference the following datasets:

1. **CSTNews**: Mentioned in the context of existing Portuguese news corpora.
2. **CHAVE**: Another Portuguese corpus.
3. **TeMA ario**: A Portuguese corpus as well.
4. **German corpus**: Referenced for political news sentiment analysis.

Additionally, the authors reference other datasets used in sentiment analysis, such as those from Pang and Lee, Curran and Koprinska, and others, but these are more general and not specific to the paper's context.

The main dataset created by the authors is their annotated corpus of political news in Brazilian Portuguese. They also mention the availability of their gold standard and annotated corpus under a Creative Commons license at a specific URL.

I need to structure each dataset with the specified metadata fields. For each dataset, I'll extract the creator, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For the main dataset created by the authors, the creators are the paper's authors. The description is based on their corpus details. The title is the name of their corpus. The issued year is 2015, as the paper was published then. The language is Brazilian Portuguese. The identifier is the URL provided. The themes are sentiment analysis and political news. Keywords include sentiment analysis, political news, Brazilian Portuguese, etc. The landing page is the URL given. The format is text. The task is sentiment analysis.

For the other datasets mentioned (CSTNews, CHAVE, TeMA ario, and the German corpus), I'll extract their creators, descriptions, titles, and other metadata from the references provided in the paper.

I need to ensure that each dataset is accurately described based on the paper's content and that all metadata fields are filled appropriately. If some fields aren't mentioned, I'll leave them empty.
