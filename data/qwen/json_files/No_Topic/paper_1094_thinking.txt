Alright, I'm looking at the provided paper titled "Inter-annotator Agreement for Dependency Annotation of Learner Language." The task is to extract all datasets mentioned in this paper and describe them using the specified metadata vocabulary. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets. The paper discusses an annotation scheme for learner English and mentions several resources and corpora used in their study. 

In the introduction, they reference learner corpora used for developing error correction systems and intelligent tutoring systems. They mention studies by Nagata et al., Rozovskaya and Roth, and others, but these are references to other works, not datasets. 

In section 3.1, they describe their corpus of written essays collected from students entering Indiana University. This is a primary dataset used in their study. They mention that the corpus includes essays on the topic "What Are Your Plans for Life?" and that they selected six essays based on proficiency levels and native languages. 

Additionally, they reference the SUSANNE corpus in section 3.5, which was used for pre-annotation with TnT. The SUSANNE corpus is a well-known resource for English language analysis. 

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. The learner corpus collected from Indiana University students.
2. The SUSANNE corpus used for pre-annotation.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
