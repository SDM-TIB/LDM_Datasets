Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "MIE: A Medical Information Extractor towards Medical Dialogues" by Yuanzhe Zhang and others. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to understand the context. The paper focuses on extracting medical information from doctor-patient dialogues to help generate Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). They mention collecting dialogues from Chunyu-Doctor, a Chinese online medical consultation website, specifically in the cardiology domain.

In the Corpus Description section, they detail their dataset. They collected 1,120 dialogues, segmented into 18,212 windows, with over 40k labels. The dialogues are in Chinese, and the annotations include symptoms, surgeries, tests, and other information, each with specific statuses.

Looking for references, the paper cites several works, but none of them are datasets. The datasets mentioned are their own, created for this study. They don't reference external datasets but describe their own corpus.

So, the only dataset mentioned is their own, which they collected and annotated. They don't cite any external datasets, so there are no other datasets to extract.
