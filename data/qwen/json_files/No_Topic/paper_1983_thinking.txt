Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about a word-in-context disambiguation system participating in SemEval-2021 Task 2. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets are involved. The abstract mentions that the system uses datasets from SemEval 2021 Task 2, focusing on multilingual and cross-lingual word disambiguation for Arabic, Chinese, English, French, and Russian. 

Looking at the sections, the "Datasets and Methods" section (Section 3) provides more details. It mentions that the dataset is detailed in the task description paper by Martelli et al., 2021. The dataset includes training and testing subsets for multilingual and cross-lingual settings, with statistics provided in Table 1. The data is in JSON format, divided into.data and.gold files, containing unique IDs, target lemmas, parts of speech, sentences, and indices. 

The paper also references the use of NLTK for tokenization and stop word removal, but that's more about the methods than the datasets. 

I need to identify the datasets mentioned. The primary dataset is from SemEval-2021 Task 2, as described by Martelli et al. There's no mention of other datasets used beyond this one. 

So, the dataset to extract is SemEval-2021 Task 2: Multilingual and Cross-lingual Word-in-Context Disambiguation. The creators are the authors of the task description paper, which are Martelli, Kalach, Tola, and Navigli. The description should include the languages covered, the structure of the dataset, and its use in the study. The issued year is 2021. The languages are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, and Russian. The format is JSON. The tasks include word sense disambiguation, specifically multilingual and cross-lingual. 

I should structure this into the required JSON format with the specified metadata fields.
