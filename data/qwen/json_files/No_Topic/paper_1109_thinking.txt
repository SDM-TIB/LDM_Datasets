Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction sections. The abstract mentions "miniImageNet" and "tieredImageNet" datasets, which are commonly used in few-shot learning research. These are key datasets to note.

Moving on to the introduction, the authors discuss various few-shot learning methods and datasets. They specifically mention "miniImageNet" and "tieredImageNet" again, confirming their use in the study.

In the "EXPERIMENT RESULTS" section, the authors detail their experiments using these datasets. They provide split ratios and configurations, which further confirms the datasets' involvement in their research.

Looking at the references, I find citations for "miniImageNet" and "tieredImageNet." These are standard benchmarks in the field, so their inclusion is expected.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The focus is solely on these two datasets for their experiments and evaluations.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
