Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about inducing latent semantic relations for structured distributional semantics. It mentions several datasets used for evaluation.

First, I'll go through the paper section by section. In the introduction, they talk about distributional semantic models and their applications, but no datasets are mentioned yet. Moving on to the related work section, they reference previous studies but don't list datasets.

In the evaluation section, they mention the WS-353 dataset and the ESL dataset. WS-353 is used for word-pair similarity scoring, and ESL is for synonym selection. These are both standard datasets in NLP for evaluating semantic models.

They also mention the SemEval-2012 task 2 dataset for semantic relation classification. This dataset includes word pairs with various semantic relations, which they used to evaluate their model's performance.

I need to extract metadata for each of these datasets. For each, I'll note the creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, themes, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

WS-353 was created by Finkelstein et al. in 2002. It's a collection of word pairs with human-annotated similarity scores. The ESL dataset was introduced by Turney in 2002, focusing on synonym selection. SemEval-2012 task 2 was organized by Jurgens et al. in 2012, involving semantic relation classification.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring accuracy based on the paper's references.
