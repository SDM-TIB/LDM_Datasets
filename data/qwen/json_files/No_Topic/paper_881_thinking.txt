Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses low-precision training in deep neural networks, mentioning datasets like ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and VOC. These are likely the main datasets used.

Looking into the sections, Section 2.4 talks about experiments using ResNet-18 on ImageNet and MobileNetV2 on CIFAR-10. Section 4.3 mentions experiments with ResNet-18 on ImageNet and MobileNetV2 on VOC. Additionally, the paper references PTB (Penn Treebank) and IWSLT for language models.

I'll check the references for more details. ImageNet is cited with Deng et al., 2009. CIFAR-10 is mentioned in the context of experiments but no specific citation is provided. VOC is referenced with Everingham et al., 2010. PTB is cited with Marcus et al., 1993, and IWSLT with Cettolo et al., 2014.

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata. For each dataset, I'll note the creators, description, title, publication year, and other relevant fields. Some details like landing pages or formats might not be explicitly mentioned, so I'll leave those empty.

Finally, I'll compile all the datasets into a JSON format, ensuring each entry is accurate based on the paper's content.
