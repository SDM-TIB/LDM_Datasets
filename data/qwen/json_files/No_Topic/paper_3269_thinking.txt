Alright, I'm looking at the provided paper titled "Kannada Sandhi Generator for Lopa and Adesha Sandhi." The task is to extract any datasets mentioned in this paper and describe them using the specified metadata vocabulary. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets. The abstract mentions the development of a sandhi generator for Kannada, focusing on lopa and Adesha sandhi. The introduction discusses the morphological richness of Kannada and the challenges in generating sandhi without a dictionary. 

In the literature review section, the authors reference works by Shashirekha and Vanishree (2016) on sandhi splitters and by Reddy and Sharoff (2011) on cross-language POS taggers. The methodology section describes the use of regular expressions and rule-based approaches without mentioning specific datasets. 

The results section mentions that 386 unique pairs of Kannada words were manually extracted from data requested from Reddy and Sharoff (2011). This suggests that the dataset used is from Reddy and Sharoff's work. 

Looking at the references, the paper cites Reddy and Sharoff (2011) as the source of the data used for testing the sandhi generator. Therefore, the dataset in question is from their work on cross-language POS taggers for Indian languages, specifically Kannada. 

I need to extract metadata for this dataset. The creators are Siva Reddy and Serge Sharoff. The description is that it's a dataset of Kannada words used for testing the sandhi generator. The title is "Kannada Word Dataset." The year is 2011. The language is Kannada. The format is text. The task is morphological analysis. 

I don't find a DOI or URL, so those fields remain empty. The theme is linguistics, and keywords include Kannada, sandhi, and morphological analysis. The landing page is also empty. There's no version mentioned, so that field is empty.
