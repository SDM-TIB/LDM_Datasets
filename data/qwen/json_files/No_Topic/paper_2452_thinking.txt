Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. That's one dataset. 

Moving to the introduction, the authors reference the PASCAL VOC challenge, which includes the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. They also mention the Freestyle Motocross dataset in their experiments. 

In the experimental results section, they discuss evaluations on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset and the Freestyle Motocross dataset. 

I should check the references for more details on these datasets. The PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset is cited in references [11] and [12], providing details about its creators, description, and publication year. The Freestyle Motocross dataset is cited in reference [27], which gives its creators and description.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the metadata fields:

1. **PASCAL VOC 2007 Dataset**:
   - **Creators**: M. Everingham, L. van Gool, C. Williams, J. Winn, A. Zisserman.
   - **Description**: A dataset for object detection and recognition, containing images with annotations for various object classes.
   - **Title**: PASCAL VOC 2007.
   - **Issued**: 2010.
   - **Theme**: Computer Vision, Object Detection.
   - **Keywords**: Object detection, Image classification, Benchmark dataset.
   - **Task**: Object detection, Image classification.

2. **Freestyle Motocross Dataset**:
   - **Creators**: M. Villamizar, F. Moreno-Noguer, J. Andrade-Cetto, A. Sanfeliu.
   - **Description**: A dataset containing images of in-plane rotated motorbikes for evaluating object detection under rotation.
   - **Title**: Freestyle Motocross Dataset.
   - **Issued**: 2010.
   - **Theme**: Computer Vision, Object Detection.
   - **Keywords**: Object detection, Rotation invariance, Motorbike detection.
   - **Task**: Object detection, Rotation invariant detection.

I'll ensure that each field is filled accurately based on the information from the paper and its references.
