Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about a verb lexicon model for string-to-tree machine translation. I need to identify all datasets mentioned and describe them using the specified metadata vocabulary.

First, I'll read through the paper to spot any datasets. The abstract mentions the system's performance but doesn't name datasets. Moving to the introduction, I see references to the German-English language pair and the use of a string-to-tree MT system. 

In Section 3, the authors discuss their analysis using the WMT15 data. They mention training on all available data from WMT15 and evaluating on newstest2013, newstest2014, and newstest2015. These are test sets from the WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation) competitions. 

Looking at the references, I find that the datasets are part of the WMT15 translation task. The authors used these datasets for training and evaluation. 

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the metadata fields. For each dataset, I'll note the creators as the authors of the WMT15 data, the description, title, year, language, and other relevant fields. 

I need to ensure that each dataset is correctly identified and that all required fields are filled based on the information provided in the paper.
