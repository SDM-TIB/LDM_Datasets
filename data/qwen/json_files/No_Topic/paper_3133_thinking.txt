Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions experiments on ScanNetV2, which is a dataset. So, that's one dataset.

Next, I'll check the introduction and related work sections. The introduction refers to ScanNetV2 again, confirming its use. The related work section also mentions ScanNetV2 in the context of experiments.

Looking at the experiments section, it explicitly states that experiments were conducted on ScanNetV2. This dataset is used for evaluating 3D geometry reconstruction, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The references section doesn't list additional datasets used in the study.

So, the only dataset identified is ScanNetV2. I'll gather the necessary metadata for this dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
