Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Lightweight Word-Level Confidence Estimation for Neural Interactive Translation Prediction" by Rebecca Knowles and Philipp Koehn. It discusses neural interactive translation prediction and evaluates their approach using specific datasets.

Looking through the sections, I find that in the "3.1 Data and MT Systems" section, the authors mention using the University of Edinburgh's neural models from WMT 2016 for several language pairs. They also reference the WMT 2016 and WMT 2017 test data sets. Additionally, they use the Nematus toolkit, which is available publicly.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. WMT 2016 test data
2. WMT 2017 test data

Now, I need to gather metadata for each dataset. 

For WMT 2016:
- Creators: The authors of the paper, Rebecca Knowles and Philipp Koehn, are using this dataset, but the creators are the organizers of WMT 2016. However, the paper doesn't provide specific creators, so I'll leave it as an empty list.
- Description: The dataset is used for evaluating neural interactive translation prediction, focusing on word-level confidence estimation.
- Title: WMT 2016 Test Data
- Issued: 2016
- Language: The paper uses English, German, and Czech, so the dataset likely includes these languages.
- Identifier: No specific DOI or URL is provided in the paper.
- Theme: Machine Translation, Quality Estimation
- Keywords: Interactive translation, confidence estimation, neural MT
- Landing Page: Not provided.
- Version: Not mentioned.
- Format: Text
- Task: Quality Estimation, Machine Translation

For WMT 2017:
- Creators: Similar to WMT 2016, the creators aren't specified in the paper.
- Description: Used for testing the model's performance in interactive translation prediction.
- Title: WMT 2017 Test Data
- Issued: 2017
- Language: English, German, Czech
- Identifier: No specific DOI or URL.
- Theme: Machine Translation, Quality Estimation
- Keywords: Interactive translation, confidence estimation, neural MT
- Landing Page: Not provided.
- Version: Not mentioned.
- Format: Text
- Task: Quality Estimation, Machine Translation

I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described based on the paper's usage.
