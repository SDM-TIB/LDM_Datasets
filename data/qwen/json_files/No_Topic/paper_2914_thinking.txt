Alright, I'm looking at the provided paper to identify the datasets mentioned. The paper is about a spoken language identification system called Anlirika, submitted to the SIGTYP 2021 Shared Task. 

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions the CMU Wilderness dataset and Common Voice. 

In the dataset section (Section 3), the authors elaborate that the training data is from CMU Wilderness, which is a single-domain dataset with one speaker per language. The validation and test sets are from Common Voice, which has multiple speakers and diverse recording conditions. 

Looking at the references, CMU Wilderness is cited as Black, 2019, and Common Voice is cited as Ardila et al., 2019. 

I need to extract metadata for each dataset. For CMU Wilderness, the creator is Alan W. Black, description is a multilingual speech dataset from the Bible, title is CMU Wilderness, issued in 2019, format is audio, and the task is spoken language identification. 

For Common Voice, the creators are Rosana Ardila, Megan Branson, Kelly Davis, Michael Henretty, Michael Kohler, Josh Meyer, Reuben Morais, Lindsay Saunders, Francis M. Tyers, and Gregor Weber. The description is a large multilingual corpus with diverse speakers, title is Common Voice, issued in 2019, format is audio, and task is spoken language identification. 

I'll structure this information into JSON format as per the metadata vocabulary provided.
