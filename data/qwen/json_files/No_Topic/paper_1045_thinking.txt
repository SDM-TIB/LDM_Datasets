Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about automatic animacy classification, and it mentions several datasets. Let me go through it step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract to get a quick overview. It talks about using a corpus of spoken English and mentions a hierarchy of animacy classes. The corpus is from Zaenen et al. (2004), so that's one dataset.

Moving to the introduction, the authors reference Ji and Lin (2009), Avrelid (2005), and Orasan and Evans (2001). These are likely other datasets or studies, but I need to check if they're datasets or just related work.

In the corpus section, they mention using Zaenen et al.'s annotated subset of the Switchboard corpus. This is the main dataset they used. They also mention the NXT version by Calhoun et al. (2010), so that's another version or related dataset.

Looking at the references, I see the Switchboard corpus is cited, and there's also mention of the NXT version. The authors used this corpus for training and testing their model.

I need to extract metadata for each dataset. For the Switchboard corpus, the creators are the authors from the reference, which is Calhoun et al. (2010). The description is about spoken English with animacy annotations. The title is "Switchboard Corpus." It was issued in 2010, language is English, and it's about linguistics and NLP tasks.

The NXT version is another dataset, so I'll list it separately with the same creators and similar details but noting it's the NXT version.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned beyond these. The other references like Ji and Lin, Avrelid, and Orasan and Evans are more about related studies rather than datasets used in this paper.

So, I'll create two entries for the Switchboard Corpus and its NXT version, each with their respective metadata.
