Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions experiments on public test sets, specifically CNN, Daily Mail, and Who Did What (WDW). These are likely the datasets used in the study.

Next, I'll check the introduction and related work sections. The introduction refers to datasets like CNN and Daily Mail, which are standard in reading comprehension tasks. The WDW dataset is also mentioned, which is another benchmark for such tasks.

Looking into the experiments section, the paper details the datasets used for evaluation. They mention the CNN and Daily Mail datasets from Hermann et al. (2015) and the WDW dataset from Onishi et al. (2016). These are the primary datasets used to evaluate their proposed methods.

I'll also check the references section to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the paper already provides the necessary details, I can proceed to describe each dataset based on the information given.

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata fields as per the vocabulary provided. This includes the creator, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

After compiling all the necessary information, I'll structure the datasets into the specified JSON format, ensuring that each field is accurately filled based on the paper's description.
