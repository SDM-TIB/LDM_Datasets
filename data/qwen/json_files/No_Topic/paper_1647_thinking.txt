Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions using transcripts and audio from earnings calls, but it doesn't specify a dataset name. The introduction also discusses earnings calls but doesn't cite a specific dataset.

Moving on to the methodology section, I see that the authors mention using the S&P 500 2017 Earnings Conference Calls dataset. This is a clear reference to a specific dataset. They also reference other works, such as MDRM and HTML, which are models, not datasets.

In the experimental setup, the authors detail their data collection, stating they used the S&P 500 2017 dataset, which includes 559 earnings call audio recordings and transcripts. They also mention extracting stock prices from Yahoo Finance, but that's a data source, not a dataset.

Looking through the references, I don't find any additional datasets mentioned beyond the S&P 500 2017 dataset. The other references are to models or methodologies, not datasets.

So, the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper is the S&P 500 2017 Earnings Conference Calls dataset. I'll need to extract its metadata based on the information provided in the paper.
