Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions that the work uses the MultiIndicMT data, which is a combination of parallel corpora from different sources. So, MultiIndicMT is one dataset.

Next, I'll go through the introduction and the data section. The paper lists several sources of data in Table 1. These include:

- CVIT-PIB (2020)
- JW (2019)
- TED (2012)
- PMIndia (2020)
- Bible-uedin (2014)
- OpenSubtitles (2016)
- WikiMatrix (2019)
- Wiki Titles (2021)
- ALT (2016)
- IITB 3.0 (2018)
- NLPC (2020)
- UFAL EnTam (2012)
- Uka Tarsadia (2019)
- MTEnglish2Odia (2018)
- OdiEnCorp 2.0 (2020)

Each of these is a dataset used in the MultiIndicMT data. I'll need to extract metadata for each of these.

Now, I'll check the references section to find more details about each dataset. For example, JW (2019) is cited as "Jasmijn Bastings, Ivan Titov, Wilker Aziz, Diego Marcheggiani, and Khalil Simaaan. 2017. Graph convolutional encoders for syntax-aware neural machine translation." So, the creator is the author(s) of that reference.

Similarly, I'll go through each dataset mentioned, extract their creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, languages, identifiers, themes, keywords, landing pages, versions, formats, and tasks based on the information provided in the paper and references.

For some datasets, like WikiMatrix, the description mentions it's a collection of parallel sentences from Wikipedia. The language is multilingual since it includes translations between multiple languages.

I'll ensure that each dataset is listed with accurate metadata, using the information provided in the paper and its references. If a dataset's details aren't explicitly mentioned, I'll infer based on the context provided.

Finally, I'll compile all this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is correctly represented with all the specified metadata fields.
