Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Comparing Data Sources and Architectures for Deep Visual Representation Learning in Semantics" by Douwe Kiela, Anita L. VerEo, and Stephen Clark. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets are being used. The abstract mentions that they compare different data sources and architectures for deep visual representation learning. They specifically mention using images from search engines and manually crafted resources like ImageNet. 

Next, I'll look into the sections where they discuss their methodology and experiments. In the "Sources of Image Data" section, they list several datasets:

1. **Google Images**: They use Google's image search results as a data source.
2. **Bing Images**: Similarly, they use Bing's image search results.
3. **Flickr**: They utilize images from Flickr, which are tagged by users.
4. **ImageNet**: A well-known dataset for computer vision tasks, structured hierarchically.
5. **ESP Game Dataset**: A dataset created through a game where players label images.

Each of these datasets is used to evaluate the performance of different convolutional neural network architectures in multi-modal semantic tasks. 

I'll also check the references section to find more details about each dataset. For example, ImageNet is cited as Deng et al., 2009, and the ESP Game dataset is referenced to von Ahn and Dabbish, 2004. 

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the specified metadata vocabulary. For each dataset, I'll extract the creator, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and the tasks it's used for.

For Google Images and Bing Images, the creators are the respective companies, but since the paper doesn't provide specific creators, I'll leave it as an empty list. The description will be based on how the paper uses these datasets. The same approach applies to Flickr, ImageNet, and the ESP Game Dataset.

I'll ensure that each dataset's metadata is accurate and reflects how it's used in the paper. If some information isn't available, I'll leave those fields empty as per the instructions.
