Alright, I'm trying to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll look through the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions MNIST, F-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. These are all well-known datasets, so I'll note them down.

Next, I'll check the sections where experiments are described. In the experiments section, the authors evaluate their method on MNIST, F-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. They also mention using Tiny-CNN, FC1, and other architectures, but those aren't datasets.

I'll also look for any references to other datasets in the methods or results sections, but it seems the only datasets mentioned are the four I noted earlier.

Now, I'll gather the metadata for each dataset. MNIST is created by Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes, published in 2010. It's an image dataset for handwritten digits. F-MNIST, or Fashion MNIST, is also by LeCun and Cortes, published in 2017, containing fashion items. CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton, published in 2010, containing images of objects and animals, respectively.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring all information is accurate and properly formatted.
