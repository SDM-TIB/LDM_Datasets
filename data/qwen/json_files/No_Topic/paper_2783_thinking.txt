Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses co-reference resolution in Spanish-English statistical machine translation. It mentions using a co-reference resolver called CorZu, which was adapted from German to Spanish. 

In the methodology section, the authors mention using the AnCora treebank for training their parser and co-reference system. They also reference the SemEval 2010 shared task dataset for evaluating their adaptation of CorZu. Additionally, they use the news commentary texts from 2011 (NC11) for their experiments, which are part of the OPUS corpus. They also mention using the English LDC Gigaword corpus for additional training material.

Now, I'll go through each section to confirm these datasets:

1. **AnCora Treebank**: Referenced in the methodology when discussing the training of the parser and co-reference system. The citation is provided as Taul√© et al., 2008.

2. **SemEval 2010 Shared Task Dataset**: Mentioned in the evaluation section where they compare their system's performance. The citation is provided as a URL.

3. **NC11 Corpus**: Part of the news commentary texts from 2011, used for experiments. The OPUS website is cited as the source.

4. **LDC Gigaword Corpus**: Used for additional training material, specifically the English version from 2007.

I'll now structure each dataset with the required metadata fields based on the information extracted from the paper.
