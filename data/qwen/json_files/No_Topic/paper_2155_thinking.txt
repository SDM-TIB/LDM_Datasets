Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about concept wikiification for COVID-19, and it mentions several datasets. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, the abstract mentions that the dataset, code, and pre-trained model are available on GitHub. The URL provided is github.com/panlybero/Covid19_wikification. So, that's one dataset related to COVID-19 concept wikiification.

In the introduction, the authors talk about the overwhelming scale of research articles about COVID-19. They mention that their dataset, code, and model are available on GitHub. So, this reinforces that the main dataset is the one on GitHub.

Looking at the sections, in section 3, the authors describe how they built their dataset. They mention using Wikipedia to construct the dataset by performing a breadth-first search starting from the COVID-19 Wikipedia page. They collected 7,238 concepts and curated a labeled dataset. This dataset is used for training concept wikiiers. They also mention that the dataset is available on GitHub.

In section 4, they talk about their end-to-end system and the models they used, but they don't mention any other datasets beyond their own. They refer to their dataset as the COVID-19 concept linking dataset, which includes both full and ambiguous datasets.

In the references, they cite several papers, but none of these are datasets in the traditional sense. They're more about methods and previous work.

So, putting it all together, the only dataset mentioned in the paper is the one they created and made available on GitHub. They don't reference any other external datasets, so that's the only one to include.
