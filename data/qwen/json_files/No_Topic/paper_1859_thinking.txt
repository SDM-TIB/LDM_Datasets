Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about enhancing lexicon-based review classification by merging and revising sentiment dictionaries. It mentions several sentiment resources that were used in their experiments.

First, I'll go through the paper to identify any datasets. The paper lists eight sentiment dictionaries that were used. Each of these dictionaries is a dataset in itself. They include AFINN, General Inquirer, Micro-WNOp, Opinion Lexicon, SentiSense, SentiWordNet, Subjectivity Lexicon, and WordNet-Affect.

For each of these datasets, I need to extract the metadata fields as specified. Let's start with AFINN. The paper mentions that AFINN contains sentiment scores ranging from -5 to 5. It was created by Finn Arup Nielsen in 2011. The dataset is in English and is used for sentiment analysis tasks. The format is text-based, and it's used for tasks like opinion mining and sentiment classification.

Next, the General Inquirer dataset. It's based on the Harvard IV-4 and Lasswell dictionaries. The creators are Stone and Hunt, from 1963. It's used for sentiment analysis and contains words categorized into positive, negative, and objective. The language is English, and it's used for tasks like opinion mining.

Micro-WNOp is another dataset mentioned. It's based on WordNet 2.0 and includes words with positive and negative scores. The creators are from the University of Pavia, and it's used for sentiment analysis tasks. The language is English, and the format is text-based.

The Opinion Lexicon, created by Hu and Liu in 2004, contains positive and negative words. It's used for sentiment analysis and opinion mining. The language is English, and it's text-based.

SentiSense, created by de Albornoz et al. in 2012, is based on Affective Norms for English Words. It's used for sentiment analysis and contains words with positive and negative scores. The language is English, and the format is text-based.

SentiWordNet, created by Baccianella et al. in 2010, is based on WordNet 2.1. It's used for sentiment analysis and contains synsets categorized into positive, negative, ambiguous, and neutral. The language is English, and the format is text-based.

The Subjectivity Lexicon, created by Riloff and Wiebe in 2003, contains words categorized into subjective, objective, and neutral. It's used for sentiment analysis and opinion mining. The language is English, and the format is text-based.

Lastly, WordNet-Affect, created by Strapparava and Valitutti in 2004, is based on WordNet 1.6. It's used for sentiment analysis and contains words categorized into positive, negative, ambiguous, and neutral. The language is English, and the format is text-based.

I need to make sure each dataset's metadata is correctly filled out, including creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks. Some fields might not be explicitly mentioned, so I'll leave them empty if necessary.
