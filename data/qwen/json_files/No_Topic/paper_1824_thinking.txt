Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The user provided a detailed example of how to think through the process, so I'll follow that approach.

First, I need to read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper is about a computer vision task, specifically something related to image processing, given the terms like "Image Encoder" and "Image-Level Decoder." 

Looking at the content, I see references to "Full View" and "Crop View," which might be different versions or subsets of a dataset. There's also mention of "Batch-level Prediction" and "Image-level Prediction," which suggests that the dataset is used for both single image and batch processing tasks.

The paper doesn't explicitly name any datasets, but it does mention "ResizeFull View" and "Crop View." These could be specific versions or configurations of a dataset. Since the paper is about image processing, the dataset likely consists of images, possibly with annotations for tasks like object detection or segmentation.

I also notice that the paper references "IEEE Xplore," which is a digital library for scientific and technical content. This might indicate that the dataset is available through IEEE, but without a specific DOI or URL, I can't confirm that.

Given the lack of explicit dataset names, I'll infer that the datasets used are related to image processing tasks, possibly involving resized and cropped images. The tasks mentioned in the paper are likely image-level and batch-level predictions, which could correspond to tasks like classification or segmentation.

Since there's no specific dataset name provided, I'll assume that the datasets are unnamed or part of a standard benchmark used in the field. However, without more information, I can't assign a specific title or creator.

In summary, the datasets mentioned in the paper are likely image datasets used for tasks like image classification or segmentation, with specific configurations like resized and cropped views. However, without explicit names or references, the metadata is limited.
