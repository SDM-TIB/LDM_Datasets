Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, I'll look through the abstract, introduction, and other sections. The paper is about constructing semantic role labels and frames for Japanese as additions to the NPCMJ Parsed Corpus. It mentions several datasets and resources:

1. **NPCMJ (NINJAL Parsed Corpus of Modern Japanese)**: This is the main dataset being extended with semantic role labels and frames. It's a web-accessible treebank.

2. **PT (Predicate-argument Thesaurus)**: Another dataset used as a repository for semantic roles and frames for Japanese predicates.

3. **PropBank**: A dataset mentioned as a reference for numbered semantic roles.

4. **FrameNet**: Referenced for named semantic roles.

5. **AMR (Abstract Meaning Representation)**: Mentioned in the context of its use with PropBank.

6. **Kyoto Corpus**: A Japanese corpus used for predicate-argument information.

7. **NAIST Corpus**: Another Japanese corpus for predicate-argument information.

8. **EDR Corpus**: A Japanese corpus for predicate-argument information.

9. **GDA Corpus**: A Japanese corpus for predicate-argument information.

10. **Japanese FrameNet**: A corpus for predicate-argument information.

11. **BCCWJ-PT (Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese with Predicate-argument information)**: A Japanese corpus used for semantic role labeling.

Now, I'll gather metadata for each dataset based on the paper's description.

- **NPCMJ**: Created by the National Institute of Japanese Language and Linguistics. It's a web-accessible treebank with Japanese parsed sentences. The paper mentions it's version 1.0 from 2016. It's in Japanese, has a landing page, and is used for semantic role labeling.

- **PT**: Created by Takeuchi et al. It's a thesaurus for Japanese predicates, version 1.0 from 2010. It's in Japanese, has a landing page, and is used for semantic roles and frames.

- **PropBank**: Created by various contributors. It's an English resource for semantic roles, version 3.0 from 2010. It's used for numbered roles.

- **FrameNet**: Created by the University of California, Berkeley. It's an English resource for frames, version 1.0 from 1998. It's used for named roles.

- **AMR**: Created by Banarescu et al. It's an English resource for abstract meaning, version 1.0 from 2013. It's used with PropBank.

- **Kyoto Corpus**: Created by Kawahara et al. It's a Japanese corpus from 2002, used for predicate-argument info.

- **NAIST Corpus**: Created by Iida et al. It's a Japanese corpus from 2007, used for predicate-argument info.

- **EDR Corpus**: Created by EDR, version 1995, used for predicate-argument info.

- **GDA Corpus**: Created by Hashida, version 0.74 from 2005, used for predicate-argument info.

- **Japanese FrameNet**: Created by Ohara et al. It's a Japanese corpus from 2006, used for predicate-argument info.

- **BCCWJ-PT**: Created by Maekawa et al. It's a Japanese corpus from 2014, used for semantic role labeling.

Each dataset's metadata is extracted based on the paper's description, including creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, languages, identifiers, themes, keywords, landing pages, versions, formats, and tasks.
