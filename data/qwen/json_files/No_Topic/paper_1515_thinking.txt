Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses fine-tuning language models for epidemic surveillance in low-resource multilingual settings. It mentions using pre-trained models like BERT and XLM-RoBERTa.

Looking through the sections, I find that the corpus DANIEL is used. It's mentioned in section 2.1, which details the dataset's contents: articles in English, Greek, Russian, and Polish, with 474, 390, 352, and 426 articles respectively. The dataset is used for epidemic event extraction, focusing on disease names and locations.

The paper also references other datasets in the references section, such as SCIBERT and BioCreative II, but these aren't used in the current study. The main dataset is DANIEL, which is cited in the paper and used for evaluation.

I'll structure the metadata for DANIEL based on the information provided. The creators are listed as the authors of the paper, but since the dataset is created by them, they are the creators. The description is based on the dataset's use and content. The title is "DANIEL". The issued year isn't explicitly stated but can be inferred from the paper's publication in 2022. The language is multilingual. The landing page is provided as a DOI. The theme is epidemic surveillance. Keywords include epidemic event extraction, low-resource languages, and pre-trained language models. The format is text, and the task is named entity recognition.

I need to ensure all fields are correctly filled based on the paper's information.
