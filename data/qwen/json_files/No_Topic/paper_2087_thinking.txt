Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses the impact of training data on statistical machine translation (SMT) systems, focusing on two techniques: probabilistic sampling and infrequent n-gram recovery. It mentions several datasets used in experiments.

Looking at the sections, the "Experimental Setup" and "Experiments" sections detail the datasets used. The main datasets mentioned are:

1. **TED Corpus**: Used for evaluating SMT systems, particularly in the context of public speeches.
2. **News Commentary (NC) Corpus**: Another dataset used for evaluating SMT systems, focusing on news content.
3. **Europarl Corpus**: A large bilingual corpus used as part of the training pool.
4. **United Nations (UN) Corpus**: Another large corpus used for training.
5. **Gigaword Corpus**: A corpus from the Associated Press used for training.

Each of these datasets is described in the paper, with details on their usage, language, and thematic categories. I'll need to extract the metadata for each, including creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, languages, themes, keywords, and formats.

I'll structure each dataset entry according to the specified JSON format, ensuring all relevant fields are filled based on the information provided in the paper.
