Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract to get an overview. It introduces the AutoGOAL framework and mentions that it's evaluated on several machine learning problems, including two recent NLP challenges. So, there might be datasets related to these challenges.

Looking at the introduction, it talks about AutoML and mentions that AutoGOAL can be applied to NLP and structured classification problems. It doesn't specify datasets here, but the evaluation section might have more details.

In the Library Usage section, there's an example code snippet that uses the 'haha' dataset. The code imports it from autogoal.datasets and loads it. So, 'haha' is definitely one dataset used in the paper.

Moving to the Implementation Details, it mentions that AutoGOAL comes with adapters from various libraries like scikit-learn, nltk, gensim, etc. But these are libraries, not datasets.

The Evaluation section is crucial. It compares AutoGOAL with other AutoML tools on classic datasets and mentions HAHA and MEDDOCAN. From the context, HAHA is an NLP dataset, and MEDDOCAN is related to entity recognition in medical documents.

Looking at the references, I find that HAHA is cited as a 2019 paper by Chiruzzo et al., and MEDDOCAN is cited by Lara-Clares and Garcia-Serrano in 2019. These references provide the creators and descriptions of the datasets.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. HAHA (Humor Analysis Based on Human Annotation)
2. MEDDOCAN (Medical Document Annotation)

Each dataset's metadata is extracted based on the information provided in the paper and references.
