Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is titled "Automatic Prediction of Morphosemantic Relations" and it's authored by several researchers from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. 

First, I'll read through the abstract to get a quick overview. It mentions the Bulgarian WordNet (BulNet) and the Princeton WordNet (PWN). These seem like datasets because they're large lexical resources. 

Moving on to the introduction, the paper talks about the MSR dataset from PWN, which is used as the core dataset. It also mentions that the dataset was extended with negative examples. So, PWN is definitely a dataset here.

In the sections that follow, the paper discusses the use of semantic primes from PWN and derivational relations in BulNet. It also refers to the morphosemantic database from PWN, which includes 17,740 links. This further confirms that PWN is a key dataset.

The paper also mentions the use of the Weka package for machine learning, but that's a tool, not a dataset. 

Looking at the references, I see that the Princeton WordNet is cited multiple times, which reinforces that it's a dataset used in the research. There's no mention of other datasets like specific corpora or other lexical resources beyond PWN and BulNet.

So, the main datasets identified are the Princeton WordNet (PWN) and the Bulgarian WordNet (BulNet). Both are lexical resources used for morphosemantic relation analysis.
