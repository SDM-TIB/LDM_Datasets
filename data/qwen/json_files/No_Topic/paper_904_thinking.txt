Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction. The abstract mentions ImageNet and facial recognition, which are well-known datasets. The introduction also discusses ImageNet and facial recognition tasks, reinforcing their use.

Moving to the related work section, I see references to CIFAR-10, which is another standard dataset. The experiments section details their setup using ImageNet and CIFAR-10, confirming their use. Additionally, the facial recognition experiments mention CelebA, LFW, CPF, AgeDB, and VGGFace2 datasets.

I'll check the references for each dataset to gather more details. For ImageNet, the reference is from 2015. CIFAR-10 is cited from 2009. CelebA is referenced from 2014, LFW from 2008, CPF from 2016, AgeDB from 2017, and VGGFace2 from 2018.

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields. For each dataset, I'll note the creators, description, title, publication year, themes, keywords, and tasks. Since some details like URLs or DOIs aren't provided in the paper, those fields will remain empty.

Finally, I'll compile all the identified datasets into a JSON format, ensuring each entry is accurate and follows the specified structure.
