Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is titled "3PointTM: Faster Measurement of High-Dimensional Transmission Matrices" by Yujun Chen and others. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to understand the context. The paper discusses a method called 3PointTM for measuring transmission matrices (TMs) more efficiently. They mention using real and simulated data to validate their approach. 

Looking into the methods section, they describe experiments using a lab prototype with a spatial light modulator (SLM) and a CCD camera. They also refer to previously measured TMs from another study by [27], which I assume is a dataset. 

In the results section, they mention experiments with a 20-degree diffuser and a tissue phantom. These are physical setups, not datasets, but they might have generated data from these experiments. 

They also reference a public dataset in their prior work, which is likely the dataset from [27]. This dataset would be used for validating their method. 

I need to check the references to find the exact dataset. The reference [27] is from Metzler et al., 2017, which is about coherent inverse scattering via transmission matrices. This paper likely provides a dataset of transmission matrices used for evaluation.

So, the dataset mentioned is from Metzler et al., 2017. It's a transmission matrix dataset used for validating the 3PointTM method. The description would include that it's a dataset of transmission matrices used for phase retrieval and inverse scattering tasks.

I'll structure this into the required JSON format, including the creator, description, title, and other relevant metadata.
