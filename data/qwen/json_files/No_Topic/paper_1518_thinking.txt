Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about Context-Aware Network Embedding (CANE) and its application in network analysis tasks like link prediction and vertex classification. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets used in the experiments. The paper mentions three datasets: Cora, HepTh, and Zhihu. 

Cora is a citation network of machine learning papers. HepTh is another citation network from arXiv, specifically in the High Energy Physics Theory domain. Zhihu is a Chinese Q&A website where users follow each other and answer questions.

Next, I need to gather metadata for each dataset. The creators of these datasets aren't explicitly mentioned in the paper, so I'll have to look them up. Cora was created by McCallum et al., HepTh by Leskovec et al., and Zhihu is a commercial site, so the creator might not be applicable.

The descriptions are based on how the paper uses them. Cora is for citation analysis, HepTh for another citation task, and Zhihu for social network analysis.

The titles are straightforward: Cora, HepTh, and Zhihu. The issued years are 2000 for Cora, 2005 for HepTh, and the paper doesn't specify for Zhihu, so it's left empty.

Languages are English for Cora and HepTh, and Chinese for Zhihu. Identifiers are the URLs provided in the paper. Themes are "Citation Network" for Cora and HepTh, and "Social Network" for Zhihu. Keywords include "Citation network," "Text information," and "Social network." Landing pages are the URLs where the datasets can be accessed. Formats are "Text" for all, as they involve text data. Tasks include "Link prediction" and "Vertex classification."

I need to structure this information into JSON format, ensuring each dataset has all the required fields, even if some are empty strings or lists.
