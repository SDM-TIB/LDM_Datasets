Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses redundancy localization in conversational agents, focusing on a new task and dataset. 

In the introduction, the authors mention using Wikipedia passages for their dataset. They refer to a dataset they created, which involves manual annotations for redundancy localization. This dataset is split into development (DEV) and test (TEST) sets.

Looking further into the paper, under Section 4, they describe the EVAL dataset. This dataset is constructed from Wikipedia passages, segmented into sub-passages and manually annotated for redundancy. They mention that the dataset is publicly available at a GitHub repository: https://github.com/kraseb/redundancy-localization.

Additionally, in Section 5, they discuss using a passage-retrieval system to collect data for training, but this doesn't seem to be a separate dataset but rather a method for data collection.

In Section 6, they describe their model and training process, which uses the EVAL dataset but doesn't mention any other datasets.

So, the main dataset mentioned is the EVAL dataset created by the authors, available on GitHub. There are no other datasets referenced in the paper.
