Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Dr.Bokeh: DiffeRentiable Occlusion-aware Bokeh Rendering" by Yichen Sheng and others. 

First, I'll go through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract and introduction don't mention specific datasets, but the methods and experiments sections might. 

Looking at the "Implementation and Results" section, I see references to several datasets:

1. **Adobe Matting Dataset**: Mentioned in the context of inpainting. It's used for generating layered scene representations.
2. **AIM-500**: Another dataset used for inpainting, likely containing images for training or testing inpainting models.
3. **Landmark Dataset**: Used for background scenes, possibly containing images of landmarks for testing or training.
4. **Light Field Dataset**: Specifically mentioned in the context of evaluating differentiable rendering. It's used for depth estimation and contains light field data.

Each of these datasets is used for different purposes in the paper, such as inpainting, background generation, or depth estimation. I'll need to extract metadata for each, including creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, and other relevant fields if available.

However, the paper doesn't provide detailed references for these datasets, so some metadata might be inferred or left empty. For example, the creators and exact publication years might not be specified, so those fields might remain empty or filled with what's available.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the specified metadata vocabulary and format them into JSON.
