Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Identifying Cleartext in Historical Ciphers" by Maria-Elena Gambardella, Beata Megyesi, and Eva Pettersson. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to understand the context. The paper discusses the challenge of distinguishing cleartext from ciphertext in historical ciphers and uses historical language models to identify the language of cleartext sequences. 

In the introduction, they mention the DECODE database, which is a collection of historical ciphers and keys. This seems like a key dataset used in their research. 

Moving to the methods section, they describe using the HistCorp platform for historical language models. HistCorp provides corpora and language models for various languages, which are essential for their language identification task. 

They also reference specific ciphers, such as the Borg and Copiale ciphers, which are part of the DECODE database. These are examples of the datasets they used for testing their models. 

Looking at the references, the DECODE database is cited as a source of their data. HistCorp is mentioned as providing the language models used in their experiments. 

I need to structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset has the appropriate metadata fields filled out based on the paper's description.
