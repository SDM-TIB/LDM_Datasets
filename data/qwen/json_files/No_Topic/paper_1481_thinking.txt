Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is titled "A Dataset and Explorer for 3D Signed Distance Functions" by Towaki Takikawa, Andrew Glassner, and Morgan McGuire. 

First, I'll read through the abstract to understand the main focus. It mentions the creation of a dataset of 63 curated SDFs. So, that's one dataset right there. 

Next, I'll look into the introduction and sections that describe the dataset. The paper details the dataset's purpose, which is to provide a reference for SDFs in computer graphics. It mentions that the dataset includes various shapes and is designed for efficiency and extensibility. 

I'll check the references to see if there are any other datasets cited. The references include works on SDFs, implicit surfaces, and related techniques, but none of these are additional datasets used in the paper beyond the main SDF dataset.

So, the only dataset mentioned is the one created by the authors, which is a collection of 63 SDFs. I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, including details like the creators, description, title, and other relevant metadata.
