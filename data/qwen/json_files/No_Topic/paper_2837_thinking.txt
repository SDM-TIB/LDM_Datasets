Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about dense monocular depth estimation in complex dynamic scenes. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The abstract mentions that the approach is evaluated on the Sintel and KITTI datasets. So, I note these two datasets.

Next, I'll look through the sections for any other datasets. The evaluation section (Section 6) discusses experiments on the KITTI odometry set and the MPI Sintel dataset. It also mentions the use of FlowFields for optical flow estimation, but that's a method, not a dataset.

I check the references for any additional datasets. The references include citations for the datasets mentioned, but no new datasets are introduced beyond Sintel and KITTI.

Now, I'll gather the metadata for each dataset. For Sintel, the creators are Butler et al., and it's a synthetic dataset for optical flow evaluation. The KITTI dataset is created by Geiger et al., focusing on urban scenes for autonomous driving.

I'll structure the JSON with the required fields, ensuring each dataset is accurately described based on the paper's usage and the references provided.
