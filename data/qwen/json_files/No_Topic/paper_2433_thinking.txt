Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, the paper is titled "FEW-SHOT REGRESSION VIA LEARNED BASIS FUNCTIONS" by Yi Loo and others. It's a conference paper from ICLR 2019. The abstract mentions few-shot learning and regression tasks, but doesn't specify datasets yet.

Looking at the introduction, the authors discuss regression tasks and few-shot learning. They mention evaluating their model on sinusoidal regression tasks and introducing two more tasks: 1D heat equation and 2D Gaussian distribution. These are likely synthetic datasets used for testing their model.

In the Related Work section, they reference the Omniglot dataset, which is a standard dataset for few-shot learning, but it's for classification, not regression. However, they don't use it in their experiments, so it's not a dataset they mention as being used.

In the Results and Evaluation section, they detail their experiments on three tasks: sinusoidal regression, 1D heat equation, and 2D Gaussian distribution. These are all synthetic datasets created for the purpose of testing their few-shot regression model.

The authors also mention comparing their model against existing methods like Meta-SGD and MAML, but these are algorithms, not datasets.

In the Additional Details section (Appendix B), they provide more information about the datasets:

1. **Sinusoidal Regression Task**: The target function is y(x) = A sin(ωx + φ) + ε, with parameters A, ω, φ, and noise ε. They sample these parameters uniformly from specific ranges.

2. **1D Heat Equation Task**: The function models the temperature distribution over time in a rod, given by the heat equation. They sample 10 points on the curve for each task.

3. **2D Gaussian Distribution Task**: The model predicts the probability distribution of a 2D Gaussian with varying mean and standard deviation.

These datasets are synthetic, meaning they're generated for the purpose of the study rather than collected from real-world data. The authors don't reference external datasets but instead describe how they generate these tasks.

In the references, they cite works that use other datasets like MNIST and Omniglot, but these aren't used in their experiments.

So, the datasets mentioned are all synthetic and created specifically for evaluating their few-shot regression model. They don't cite any external datasets used in their experiments.
