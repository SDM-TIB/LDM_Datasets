Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Optum at MEDIQA 2021: Abstractive Summarization of Radiology Reports using simple BART Fine-tuning" by Ravi Kondadadi and others. The abstract mentions that they participated in Task 3 of the MEDIQA 2021 challenge, which involves radiology report summarization. They used a subset of the MIMIC-CXR dataset for fine-tuning their models.

Looking further into the introduction, the authors explain that MIMIC-CXR is a large, publicly available dataset of chest radiographs in DICOM format with free-text radiology reports. They also mention using a subset of the Indiana dataset for validation.

In the task description section, it's detailed that the training data comes from MIMIC-CXR, containing around 91,544 examples. The validation sets include 2000 examples from MIMIC-CXR and another 2000 from the Indiana University dataset.

The references section provides more details about MIMIC-CXR, citing Johnson et al., 2019, and mentions the Indiana dataset as well.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. MIMIC-CXR Dataset
2. Indiana Dataset

Now, I'll extract the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
