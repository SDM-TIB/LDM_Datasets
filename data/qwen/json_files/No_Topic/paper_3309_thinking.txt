Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

The paper is titled "Latent Trees for Coreference Resolution" by Eraldo Rezende Fernandes, CA Acero Nogueira dos Santos, and Ruy Luiz Milidi A u. It discusses a system for coreference resolution using latent trees and entropy-guided feature induction. The authors mention the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task datasets, which are multilingual and include Arabic, Chinese, and English.

Looking through the paper, the datasets are mentioned in the introduction and several sections. The CoNLL-2012 Shared Task datasets are the primary datasets used for evaluation. These datasets are part of the OntoNotes project and include coreference information along with other annotation layers.

I need to extract metadata for these datasets. The creators are the authors of the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task, which includes Sameer Pradhan, Alessandro Moschitti, Nianwen Xue, Olga Uryupina, and Yuchen Zhang. The description should reflect that these are multilingual datasets for coreference resolution. The title is "CoNLL-2012 Shared Task: Multilingual Unrestricted Coreference Resolution". The year is 2012. The languages are Arabic, Chinese, and English. The format is text, and the tasks include coreference resolution.

I should structure this information into a JSON format as specified, ensuring all required fields are included. Since the paper doesn't provide DOIs or URLs for the datasets, those fields will be empty. The themes are natural language processing and coreference resolution. Keywords include coreference resolution, multilingual, and OntoNotes.

Now, I'll compile this information into the required JSON format.
