Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "SCAR: Sentence Compression using Autoencoders for Reconstruction" by Chanakya Malireddy, Tirth Maniar, and Manish Shrivastava. It discusses an unsupervised deep learning framework for sentence compression.

In the abstract, they mention using benchmark datasets to evaluate their model. The introduction and related work sections don't specify the datasets, but the experiments section provides more details.

Looking at the experiments section (Section 4), they mention using the Gigaword corpus and DUC datasets. Specifically, they reference the Gigaword corpus (Rush et al., 2015) and DUC-2003 and DUC-2004 shared tasks (Over et al., 2007).

Now, I need to gather metadata for each dataset:

1. **Gigaword Corpus**:
   - Creators: Rush, Sumit Chopra, Jason Weston (from the reference)
   - Description: A large corpus used for text summarization, containing news articles and their summaries.
   - Title: Gigaword Corpus
   - Issued: 2015 (from the reference)
   - Language: English
   - Identifier: Not provided in the paper
   - Theme: Text Summarization, Natural Language Processing
   - Keywords: Text summarization, news articles, sentence compression
   - Landing Page: Not provided
   - Version: Not mentioned
   - Format: Text
   - Task: Sentence compression, text summarization

2. **DUC Datasets (DUC-2003 and DUC-2004)**:
   - Creators: Paul Over, Hoa Dang, Donna Harman (from the reference)
   - Description: Datasets containing news articles and human-generated summaries, used for evaluating text summarization systems.
   - Title: DUC-2003 and DUC-2004
   - Issued: 2007 (from the reference)
   - Language: English
   - Identifier: Not provided
   - Theme: Text Summarization, Natural Language Processing
   - Keywords: Text summarization, news articles, evaluation
   - Landing Page: Not provided
   - Version: 2003 and 2004
   - Format: Text
   - Task: Text summarization, sentence compression

I need to structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described with the appropriate metadata fields.
