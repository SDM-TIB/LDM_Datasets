Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "DiaHClust: an iterative hierarchical clustering approach for identifying stages in language change" by Christin Sch√§tzle and Hannah Booth. The abstract mentions the use of a corpus-based approach to study syntactic change in Icelandic. 

In the introduction, the authors discuss traditional periodization methods and introduce their data-driven approach. They reference corpus-based studies, particularly in historical English, but the main focus is on their new method, DiaHClust.

Moving to the methodology section, the authors describe their approach using vectors of syntactic change. They mention the Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus (IcePaHC) as the dataset they used. This corpus is a Penn-style treebank annotated for syntactic structures.

In the case study section, they detail how they applied DiaHClust to IcePaHC, extracting relative frequencies of syntactic features. They reference the corpus as their primary dataset, noting its composition and limitations, such as data sparsity and genre bias.

The references section includes citations for IcePaHC, authored by Wallenberg et al. in 2011. This confirms the dataset's origin and publication details.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The focus is entirely on IcePaHC for their syntactic change analysis.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for IcePaHC based on the information extracted.
