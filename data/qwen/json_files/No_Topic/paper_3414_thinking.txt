Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "ARShadowGAN: Shadow Generative Adversarial Network for Augmented Reality in Single Light Scenes" by Daquan Liu and others. The abstract mentions the construction of a new dataset called the Shadow-AR dataset. 

Looking further into the paper, the authors describe the Shadow-AR dataset in detail. It consists of 3,000 quintuples, each containing images related to synthetic AR scenes with virtual objects and their shadows. The dataset includes images without virtual shadows, corresponding images with shadows, masks of virtual objects, and annotations of real-world shadows and occluders.

Additionally, the paper references several existing datasets in the literature review. These include SBU, SRD, ISTD, ShapeNet, and others. However, the primary focus is on the newly constructed Shadow-AR dataset.

I need to structure the metadata for the Shadow-AR dataset using the specified vocabulary. The creators are the authors of the paper, the description is based on the dataset's purpose and contents, the title is "Shadow-AR dataset," the year is 2020 (as inferred from the paper's publication details), the themes are Computer Vision and Augmented Reality, keywords include shadow generation, AR, and synthetic data, the format is Image, and the task is Shadow Generation.

I should ensure that all fields are accurately filled based on the information provided in the paper.
