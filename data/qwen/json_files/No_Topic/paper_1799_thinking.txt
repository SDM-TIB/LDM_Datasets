Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Learning Mid-level Filters for Person Re-identification" by Rui Zhao, Wanli Ouyang, and Xiaogang Wang. The abstract mentions that the effectiveness of their approach is validated on the VIPeR dataset and the CUHK01 dataset. 

Looking further into the paper, in section 5.1, the authors detail the datasets they used. They mention the VIPeR dataset, which was captured from two hand-held cameras in an outdoor academic environment. It contains 632 pedestrian pairs, each with two images from different camera views. The CUHK01 dataset is also mentioned, captured with two camera views in a campus environment, containing 971 persons, each with two images from two camera views.

I need to gather metadata for each dataset. For VIPeR, the creators are mentioned in the paper's references as D. Gray, S. Brennan, and H. Tao. The description is based on how the authors used it: for person re-identification with significant viewpoint changes. The title is VIPeR. The year is 2007, as per the reference. The format is images. The tasks include person re-identification.

For CUHK01, the creators are W. Li, R. Zhao, and X. Wang, as per the paper's references. The description is similar, focusing on person re-identification with images normalized to 160x60. The title is CUHK01, the year is 2012, the format is images, and the task is person re-identification.

I need to structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring all fields are filled appropriately based on the paper's content.
