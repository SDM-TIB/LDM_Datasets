Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and discusses various datasets used for evaluation. 

First, I'll go through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper references several datasets in the context of experiments and evaluations. 

Looking at the references, I see mentions of datasets like Rome, Quad, Dubrovnik, Alamo, Ellis Island, Gendarmenmarkt, Madrid Metropolis, Montreal Notre Dame, NYC Library, Piazza del Popolo, Piccadilly, Roman Forum, Tower of London, Trafalgar, Union Square, Vienna Cathedral, and Yorkminster. These are all large-scale unordered Internet photo collections used to evaluate the SfM algorithm.

Each of these datasets is described in the context of experiments, where the authors evaluate their method's performance. The datasets are used to test the robustness, accuracy, completeness, and scalability of their SfM system.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields. The creators are the authors of the paper since they are the ones who created the datasets for their experiments. The description will be based on how the datasets are used in the paper. The title is the name of the dataset. The issued year isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll leave it as an empty string. The language, identifier, landing page, version, format, and keywords will be filled based on the information available.

For example, the Rome dataset is described as containing 74,394 images. The Quad dataset has 6,514 images and ground truth camera locations. Each dataset is part of the experiments to evaluate the SfM system's performance.

I'll ensure each dataset entry is accurate and follows the specified JSON format, including all necessary fields. If any information isn't available, I'll leave the corresponding field empty.
