Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses audio-text alignment without parallel data, using visual knowledge transfer. It mentions several datasets in the context of experiments and evaluations.

Looking at the sections, I see references to datasets like ESC50, US8K, AudioSet, AudioCaps, and Clotho. Each of these is used for different tasks such as audio classification, captioning, and retrieval.

For each dataset, I need to extract the metadata fields. Let's break it down:

1. **ESC50**: This dataset is used for environmental sound classification. It has 50 classes with 2000 audio clips. The creators are mentioned as Piczak, and it was introduced in 2015. The format is audio, and it's used for classification tasks.

2. **US8K**: Another audio classification dataset with 10 classes and 8732 clips. Salamon et al. created it in 2014. It's used for classification tasks.

3. **AudioSet**: A large-scale dataset for audio event classification with multi-label annotations. Gemmeke et al. introduced it in 2017. It's used for multi-label classification.

4. **AudioCaps**: A dataset for audio captioning, built on AudioSet. Kim et al. created it in 2019. It's used for captioning tasks.

5. **Clotho**: Focuses on audio captioning with longer clips. Drossos et al. introduced it in 2020. It's used for captioning and retrieval tasks.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring accuracy based on the paper's descriptions.
