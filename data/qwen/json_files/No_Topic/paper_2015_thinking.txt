Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about zero-shot event extraction using the HTR framework. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions the ACE2005 dataset, which is a standard dataset for event extraction. That's one dataset.

Next, I'll look through the introduction and related work sections. The introduction provides more context about ACE2005, confirming its use. The related work section mentions other studies but doesn't reference additional datasets.

In the experiment section, the authors evaluate their method on ACE2005, using the same data split as previous works. They don't mention any other datasets, so ACE2005 is the only one.

I'll check the references to see if any other datasets are cited, but they only reference the ACE2005 dataset. No other datasets are mentioned elsewhere in the paper.

So, the only dataset used in this paper is ACE2005. I'll gather the metadata for it based on the information provided in the paper.
