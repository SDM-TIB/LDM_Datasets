Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses a probabilistic model for cross-domain visual recognition, mentioning experiments on four challenging image collections. These are likely the datasets I need to focus on.

Looking further into the paper, under the "Experiments" section, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **E-Album**: This dataset is used for experiments involving face recognition, location, and event recognition across three domains. It contains 108 photos with annotations for people, locations, and events.

2. **G-Album**: Another dataset used for similar experiments, containing 312 photos with annotations for people, locations, and events.

3. **VP dataset**: This dataset is used for experiments involving face recognition, gesture recognition, and scene recognition. It contains 1124 images of 8 politicians, with annotations for people, gestures, and scenes.

4. **SUN 09 dataset**: This dataset is used for experiments involving multiple concepts co-occurring in images. It contains 12,000 annotated images covering a large number of indoor and outdoor scene categories.

Now, I'll gather the necessary metadata for each dataset:

- **E-Album**: The creators are not explicitly mentioned in the paper, but the dataset is referenced in the context of experiments. The description is based on how the authors used it. The title is "E-Album". The year is not provided, so it's left empty. The language is not applicable. The identifier is not provided. The themes are "Computer Vision" and "Image Recognition". Keywords include "Face recognition", "Location recognition", and "Event recognition". The landing page is not provided. The format is "Image". The tasks include "Face Recognition", "Location Recognition", and "Event Recognition".

- **G-Album**: Similar to E-Album, the creators are not explicitly mentioned. The description is based on the authors' usage. The title is "G-Album". The year is not provided. The language is not applicable. The identifier is not provided. The themes are "Computer Vision" and "Image Recognition". Keywords include "Face recognition", "Location recognition", and "Event recognition". The landing page is not provided. The format is "Image". The tasks include "Face Recognition", "Location Recognition", and "Event Recognition".

- **VP dataset**: The creators are not explicitly mentioned. The description is based on the authors' usage. The title is "VP dataset". The year is not provided. The language is not applicable. The identifier is not provided. The themes are "Computer Vision" and "Image Recognition". Keywords include "Face recognition", "Gesture recognition", and "Scene recognition". The landing page is not provided. The format is "Image". The tasks include "Face Recognition", "Gesture Recognition", and "Scene Recognition".

- **SUN 09 dataset**: The creators are not explicitly mentioned. The description is based on the authors' usage. The title is "SUN 09 dataset". The year is not provided. The language is not applicable. The identifier is not provided. The themes are "Computer Vision" and "Scene Recognition". Keywords include "Scene recognition" and "Contextual information". The landing page is not provided. The format is "Image". The tasks include "Scene Recognition".

I need to ensure that each dataset is accurately described based on the information provided in the paper. If any metadata fields are not explicitly mentioned, I'll leave them empty or use appropriate defaults.
