Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about a Chinese word segmentation system for microblogs. Let me go through it step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract to get an overview. It mentions that the system uses a combination of annotated microblogs and the People Daily corpus as training data. So, I note down "annotated microblogs" and "People Daily corpus" as potential datasets.

Moving on to the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of word segmentation in microblogs, mentioning the use of a small set of annotated microblogs and the People Daily corpus. They also refer to unlabeled data crawled from microblogs. So, I add "unlabeled microblogs" as another dataset.

In the section on system architecture, they talk about using features from unlabeled data, which I've already noted. They also mention extracting a lexicon from auto-analyzed data, but that's more about processing than a dataset.

Looking at the experiments section, they detail the data preparation. They crawled 1 million microblog entries, manually annotated 1,442 entries, and used 183,630 lines from People Daily. So, I confirm the datasets as:

1. Annotated microblogs (1,442 entries)
2. People Daily corpus (183,630 lines)
3. Unlabeled microblogs (1 million entries)

I don't find any other datasets mentioned. The references don't add new datasets beyond what's already noted. 

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields. For each, I'll provide the creator, description, title, issued date, language, identifier, theme, keyword, landing page, version, format, and task.

For the annotated microblogs, the creators are the authors of the paper since they manually annotated the data. The description is about the 1,442 entries used for training. The title is straightforward, and the language is Chinese. The format is text, and the task is word segmentation.

Similarly, the People Daily corpus is a standard dataset, so the creators are the authors of that corpus. The description is about its use in the paper, and the rest follows accordingly.

The unlabeled microblogs were crawled by the paper's authors, so they are the creators. The description is about the 1 million entries used for semi-supervised learning. The format is text, and the task is word segmentation.

I make sure each dataset is clearly defined and all metadata fields are filled based on the information provided in the paper.
