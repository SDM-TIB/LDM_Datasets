Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions the creation of SEJFEK, a grammatical lexicon and shallow grammar for Polish economic terminology. This seems like a dataset, so I'll note that down.

Next, I'll check the introduction. It discusses the importance of terminology in NLP and mentions the need for resources in Slavic languages. It references the creation of SEJFEK, which I've already noted.

Moving on to Section 2, it details the construction of SEJFEK. It mentions the use of various web sources and printed lexicons. These sources might be datasets, but they're not explicitly named as datasets in the paper. They're more like data collection methods rather than datasets themselves.

In Section 3, the paper talks about converting SEJFEK into a shallow grammar using Spejd. This process doesn't mention any additional datasets, just the transformation of SEJFEK.

The evaluation section in Section 4 mentions a manually annotated corpus of economic texts from Wikipedia. This is another dataset, specifically a corpus used for evaluation.

Looking through the references, I don't see any additional datasets mentioned beyond SEJFEK and the evaluation corpus.

So, the datasets identified are:
1. SEJFEK - the grammatical lexicon and shallow grammar.
2. The manually annotated corpus of Wikipedia economic articles used for evaluation.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
