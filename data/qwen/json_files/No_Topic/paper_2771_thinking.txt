Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "GBD-NER at PARSEME Shared Task 2018: Multiword Expression Detection Using Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory Networks and Graph-Based Decoding." It's authored by Tiberiu Boros and Ruxandra Burtica from Adobe Romania.

In the abstract, they mention using standard MWE corpora from the PARSEME Shared Task. So, the first dataset is the PARSEME corpus.

Looking into the introduction, they discuss the challenges of MWE detection and mention that their approach was evaluated during the PARSEME Shared Task. This confirms the use of the PARSEME corpus.

In the related work section, they reference other studies but don't mention additional datasets. The methodology and experimental sections focus on their approach and results, not on other datasets.

The references section includes several works, but the only dataset explicitly mentioned is the PARSEME corpus.

So, the only dataset mentioned in the paper is the PARSEME corpus. I'll extract its metadata based on the information provided in the paper.
