Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Depth-Aware Stereo Video Retargeting" and is authored by Bing Li, Chia-Wen Lin, Boxin Shi, Tiejun Huang, Wen Gao, and C.-C. Jay Kuo. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is demonstrated by experimental results, but no specific datasets are named here.

Moving to the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of stereo video retargeting and mention that their method is compared with existing methods. They reference works by Basha et al., Shen et al., and others, but these are not datasets.

In the Related Work section, they discuss various methods for 2D and stereo image/video retargeting. They mention datasets used by other researchers, such as the VOC dataset (Visual Object Classes) in Table 1. The VOC dataset is used for evaluating object detection and image segmentation tasks.

Looking further, in the Experiments section, the authors mention testing their method on various videos, including movies like Ice Age 4 and Madagascar 3. However, these are not datasets but rather video content used for testing.

They also reference the dataset used by CVW (Consistent Volumetric Warping) in their experiments, but the name of this dataset isn't explicitly provided. It's possible that the CVW dataset is a custom dataset used by the authors, but without more information, I can't confirm its details.

In the references, the authors cite various works, but none of these are datasets. The only dataset mentioned is the VOC dataset, which is used for evaluating image retargeting methods.

So, the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper is the VOC dataset. It's used for evaluating the performance of their method against other image retargeting techniques.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for the VOC dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
