Alright, I'm trying to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about uncertainty-aware predictions for graph neural networks. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions that the proposed method is validated on six real network datasets. That's a clue that there are six datasets used, but they aren't named here. I'll need to find more details in the paper.

Moving on to the introduction, I don't see any specific datasets mentioned. It's more about the problem statement and the motivation behind the research.

In the related work section, there are references to other studies, but no datasets are mentioned here either.

The proposed approach section is technical and doesn't list any datasets. It's more about the methodology.

Now, I'll check the experiments section. This is where datasets are usually mentioned. The paper mentions six datasets: Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, Coauthor Physics, Amazon Computer, and Amazon Photo. These are all citation network datasets and product co-purchase graphs.

Looking at the tables, Table 1 provides details about each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, classes, features, and splits for training, validation, and test. This confirms the datasets used.

I also need to check the references for any additional datasets, but it seems all the datasets are already listed in the experiments section.

So, the datasets mentioned are Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, Coauthor Physics, Amazon Computer, and Amazon Photo. Each is a graph dataset used for semi-supervised node classification tasks.
