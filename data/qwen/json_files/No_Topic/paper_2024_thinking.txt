Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about sentiment analysis for low-resource languages, specifically using Indonesian tweets. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that they used four thousand manually labeled tweets collected in February and March 2016. That's one dataset. 

Looking further into the paper, in the Data Collection section (4.1), they mention collecting 900,000 Indonesian tweets from Twitter Public Streams using a Python script and Tweepy package. This is another dataset. They also downloaded 61,374,640 Indonesian tokens from Wikipedia for building a word2vec model. That's a third dataset. Additionally, they used 1,694 Emoji definitions for normalization. That's a fourth dataset.

Now, I need to extract metadata for each of these datasets.
