Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about lexical access using a co-occurrence network built from Wikipedia abstracts. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that they built a co-occurrence network using Wikipedia abstracts. That's a key point. 

Looking further into the introduction, they talk about various lexical resources like WordNet, Roget's Thesaurus, and others. These are datasets or resources used in the field. 

In the section about their approach, they specifically mention using Wikipedia abstracts to build their co-occurrence network. They also reference other works that used similar resources, like Zock et al. (2010) who used a matrix based on co-occurrences. 

I should check if these are actual datasets or just mentions of other works. Wikipedia abstracts are a dataset, but they're not a formal dataset with a specific name or creators. WordNet is a well-known dataset, so that's another one. 

I also see references to other works, like JeuxDeMot and AKI, but those are more like tools or systems rather than datasets. 

So, the main datasets mentioned are:
1. Wikipedia abstracts used to build their co-occurrence network.
2. WordNet, which is referenced as a lexical resource.

I need to extract metadata for these datasets. For Wikipedia abstracts, the creators would be the Wikimedia Foundation, but the paper doesn't specify that. The description is that it's a large corpus of abstracts used for co-occurrence analysis. The title would be "Wikipedia Abstracts." The language is English, and the format is text. 

For WordNet, the creators are George Miller and others, as mentioned in the references. The description is a lexical database of English words. The title is "WordNet," issued in 1990, in English, with a DOI identifier, and the format is text.

I should structure this into JSON format with the required metadata fields.
