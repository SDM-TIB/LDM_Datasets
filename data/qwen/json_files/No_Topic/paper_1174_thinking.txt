Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about creating a large-scale dataset for empathetic response generation, called EDOS. It also references several other datasets in the literature.

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions EDOS, which is the main dataset created in this paper. Then, in the introduction, the authors reference several existing datasets like IEMOCAP, MELD, DailyDialogue, EmotionLines, EmoContext, EmpatheticDialogues, and EDOS. 

Looking at the methodology section, they mention using OpenSubtitles as a source for their dataset. So, OpenSubtitles is another dataset they used. 

I need to extract each of these datasets and describe them using the specified metadata vocabulary. For each dataset, I'll look for the creator, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For EDOS, the creators are the authors of the paper. The description is provided in the paper. The title is "EDOS". The year is 2021. The language is English. The landing page is the GitHub repository mentioned. The theme is Natural Language Processing. Keywords include empathetic response, dialogue, emotions, etc. The format is text. The task is empathetic response generation.

For IEMOCAP, the creators are Busso et al. The description is about emotion recognition in speech. The year is 2008. The landing page is the IEMOCAP website. Themes are speech processing and emotion recognition. Keywords include speech, emotion, etc. The format is audio. The task is emotion recognition.

Similarly, I'll go through each dataset mentioned, extract the relevant information, and structure it into JSON format as required.
