Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Energy Disaggregation via Discriminative Sparse Coding" by J. Zico Kolter, Siddarth Batra, and Andrew Y. Ng. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets are being used. The abstract mentions energy disaggregation and refers to a dataset from Plugwise. The introduction also discusses the Plugwise dataset, which contains hourly energy readings from 10,165 devices across 590 homes over two years. 

Looking further into the paper, the authors describe their experiments using the Plugwise data set. They mention that the data is split into training and test sets, with 70% of the homes in the training set and 30% in the test set. The data is organized into weeks, and they use it to train and test their energy disaggregation algorithms.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The references section lists various sources, but none of them are datasets used in the paper. The only dataset explicitly mentioned is the Plugwise dataset.

So, the key points about the Plugwise dataset are:
- It's a large-scale dataset with 10,165 devices and 590 homes.
- Data is collected over more than two years.
- It includes hourly energy readings.
- The data is used for training and testing energy disaggregation models.

I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring all the metadata fields are filled appropriately based on the information provided in the paper.
