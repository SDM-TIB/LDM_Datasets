Alright, I'm looking at the provided research paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper discusses a task-oriented dialogue system using transformer models and symbolic injection. 

In the introduction, they mention using the DSTC8 dataset. Specifically, in the section describing their experiments, they state: "We evaluated our system on the multi-domain DSTC8 data set..." and later, "We chose this data set due to: 1) its rich annotations across the whole dialogue pipeline; 2) its size that exceeds the existing dialogue corpora in scale (with over 20K multi-domain, task-oriented dialogues spanning 45 APIs over 20 domains); and 3) it contains a significant amount of dialogues for the transportation domain."

Additionally, they reference the Schema-Guided Dialogue dataset from DSTC8-Task4. 

I need to extract metadata for these datasets. 

For DSTC8, the creators are the authors of the dataset, which I assume are the ones mentioned in the paper's references. However, the paper doesn't provide explicit references for the datasets, so I'll infer based on the context provided.

The description should include the details from the paper, such as it being a multi-domain dataset with over 20K dialogues, rich annotations, etc.

The title is "DSTC8" and "Schema-Guided Dialogue Dataset."

The issued year isn't provided, but since DSTC8 is a known challenge, I can infer it's from around 2019.

The language is English, as it's a standard dialogue dataset.

The format is text, as it's a dialogue corpus.

The tasks include dialogue state tracking, intent recognition, and natural language generation.

I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is properly described with the relevant metadata fields.
