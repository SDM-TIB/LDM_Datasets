Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Warp to the Future: Joint Forecasting of Features and Feature Motion" by Josip ESarić, Marin OrEsić, Tonći Antunović, Sacha VraEzić, and SiniEsa ESegvić. It's about semantic segmentation forecasting using feature-level approaches.

Looking through the abstract, I see they mention experiments on the Cityscapes dataset. That's one dataset.

In the introduction, they reference several works that use other datasets, but I need to focus on datasets explicitly mentioned in this paper. The abstract and sections mention Cityscapes multiple times, especially in the experiments section.

In the experiments section (Section 4), they detail their evaluations on the Cityscapes dataset. They mention using the in-finely annotated subset with 2975 train, 500 validation, and 1525 test images. Each labeled image corresponds to the 20th frame of a 1.8-second-long video clip (30 frames). This indicates the dataset's structure and usage.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The references include other works, but the datasets used in this specific paper are only Cityscapes.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for the Cityscapes dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
