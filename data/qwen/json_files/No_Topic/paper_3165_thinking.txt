Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Improving Event Temporal Relation Classification via Auxiliary Label-Aware Contrastive Learning" by Tiesen Sun and Lishuang Li. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses Event Temporal Relation Classification (ETRC) and mentions two datasets: TB-Dense and MATRES. 

Looking into the "6.1 Dataset" section, I find more details. TB-Dense is a dataset annotated based on TimeBank, focusing on event temporal relations with six categories. MATRES is another dataset derived from TimeBank and TempEval, with four temporal relations. 

I'll check the references for more details on these datasets. TB-Dense is cited as Cassidy et al., 2014, and MATRES as Ning et al., 2018. 

Now, I'll structure each dataset using the specified metadata vocabulary. For each dataset, I'll include the creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, themes, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

I need to ensure that the creators are correctly identified from the references. For TB-Dense, the creators are Taylor Cassidy, Bill McDowell, Nathanael Chambers, and Steven Bethard. For MATRES, the creators are Qiang Ning, Hao Wu, and Dan Roth.

The descriptions are based on how the paper uses these datasets. Both are used for evaluating ETRC models. The themes are "Natural Language Processing" and "Event Temporal Relations." The keywords include "Event temporal relations," "Natural language processing," and "Text classification." The format is "Text," and the tasks are "Event Temporal Relation Classification."

I'll make sure to format the JSON correctly, ensuring all fields are included even if some are empty strings or lists.
