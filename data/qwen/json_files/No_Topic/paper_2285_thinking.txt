Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Using character overlap to improve language transformation" and focuses on translating Middle Dutch to Modern Dutch. The authors mention several literary works from the Digital Library of Dutch Literature (DBNL). These works are used as training data for their machine translation models.

Looking at the sections, the "5 Data Set" section lists the datasets used. The datasets include:

1. "aMiddle Dutcha" - This is a broad definition covering various Middle Dutch works.
2. "Van den vos Reynaerde" - A specific Middle Dutch literary work.
3. "Sint Brandaan" - Another Middle Dutch text.
4. "Gruuthuuse gedichten" - Poems by Gruuthuuse.
5. "at Prieel van Trojen" - A Middle Dutch text.
6. "Various poems" - Additional poetic works.

Each of these datasets is part of the DBNL and consists of literary works with their modern Dutch translations. The datasets are used to train the machine translation models, focusing on character overlap to improve translation accuracy.

I need to structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is described with the appropriate metadata fields.
