Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about HIBOU, an eBook designed to help beginning readers of French improve their text comprehension and reading fluency. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the ALECTOR corpus, which seems to be a key dataset used in the study. 

Looking further into the paper, in section 4, it details that the texts in HIBOU are part of the ALECTOR corpus. This corpus contains 79 original French texts with their simplified versions. The corpus is available online, and most of these texts (69) are integrated into HIBOU. 

I need to extract metadata for the ALECTOR corpus. The creators are mentioned in the references as Gala, N., Tack, A., Javourey-Drevet, L., Fran√ßoise, T., & Ziegler, J. C. The description should include that it's a parallel corpus with original and simplified texts. The title is "ALECTOR corpus." The year it was published is 2020, as per the reference. The language is French. The landing page URL is provided as https://corpusalector.huma-num.fr/. 

The themes are related to text simplification and reading comprehension. Keywords include "text simplification," "French corpus," and "reading comprehension." The format is text, and the task is text simplification.

I should structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring all fields are correctly filled based on the metadata vocabulary provided.
