Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction. The abstract mentions the Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset, which is a key dataset used in their experiments. 

Next, I'll look into the sections where datasets are discussed in detail. In the introduction, the authors reference several datasets, including the Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset [1], which is crucial for their work. They also mention other datasets like KITTI and NuScenes, but these aren't the focus of their experiments.

In the experiments section, the authors detail their use of the Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset. They split it into training and testing sets, providing specifics about the data, such as the number of samples and the types of annotations. This dataset is central to their research, as they evaluate their model's performance on it under various conditions.

I also need to check the references section for any additional datasets. The paper cites several works, but most of them are related to methods or other studies rather than datasets. The main dataset used is clearly the Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for the Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset based on the information provided in the paper. The creators are listed in the reference, the description is taken from how the authors used it, and other fields like the year, themes, keywords, etc., are filled accordingly.

I should ensure that all the metadata fields are accurately filled based on the paper's description. Since the paper doesn't mention other datasets in detail, I'll focus solely on the Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset for this task.
