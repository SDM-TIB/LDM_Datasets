Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Multi-layer Annotation of the R. gveda" and is authored by Oliver Hellwig, Heinrich Hettrich, Ashutosh Modi, and Manfred Pinkal. The abstract mentions the creation of a multi-layer annotation of the R. GVEDA, a Sanskrit text. It refers to the corpus as a novel annotated corpus of Vedic Sanskrit.

Looking through the introduction, the authors discuss the R. V (Rigveda) and mention that the corpus merges phonetic, morphological, lexical, and syntactic annotations. They also provide a URL for accessing the corpus: https://git.adwmainz.net/open/rigveda.

In the related research section, they mention other works but don't reference other datasets. The methods sections discuss the creation of the corpus, including morpho-lexical annotation and verb-argument annotation, but these are part of the same dataset.

The conclusion reiterates the availability of the corpus at the provided URL and its significance for linguistic research.

So, the only dataset mentioned is the R. GVEDA corpus, which is the focus of the paper. It's described as a multi-layer annotated corpus of Vedic Sanskrit, available under a Creative Commons license at the given URL.

Now, I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring all metadata fields are filled appropriately based on the paper's description.
