Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about modeling regular subcategorization changes in German particle verbs. It mentions several datasets and resources used in their experiments.

First, I'll go through the paper section by section. In the introduction, they talk about using a corpus for their experiments. Specifically, they mention the SDeWaC corpus, which is a large German corpus. They also reference a database compiled by Scheible et al. (2013) for extracting features.

Looking at the references, I find that the SDeWaC corpus is cited as being processed with the Mate dependency parser. The Scheible et al. (2013) reference is about a database for German verb subcategorization.

I need to extract the metadata for each dataset mentioned. For the SDeWaC corpus, the creators are Faa and Eckart, and it's a large German corpus. The database by Scheible et al. is used for extracting features related to verb subcategorization.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields. For each, I'll note the creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, themes, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

Since the paper doesn't provide DOIs or URLs for these datasets, those fields will be empty. The themes are based on the context in which the datasets are used, like computational linguistics and natural language processing. Keywords are derived from the dataset's purpose, such as "German corpus" and "verb subcategorization."

Finally, I'll compile this information into the JSON format, ensuring each dataset is correctly represented with all the necessary metadata.
