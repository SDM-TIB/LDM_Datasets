Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses neural machine translation systems for the WAT21 restricted translation task. They mention using a new training approach and constrained decoding. 

Looking through the sections, I find references to datasets in the context of training and evaluation. Specifically, in the "System Details" section, they mention using ParaCrawl-v5.1 and Wiki Titles v2 for pre-training, and ASPEC for domain adaptation. 

ParaCrawl-v5.1 is cited as a large parallel corpus, and Wiki Titles v2 is another parallel corpus. ASPEC is used for evaluation. 

I'll check the references for more details. ParaCrawl is cited in the paper, and Wiki Titles is mentioned as well. ASPEC is part of the WAT21 task, so it's likely a standard dataset for evaluation.

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata. For each, I'll note the creators, description, title, year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

I need to ensure that the creators are correctly identified from the references. For ParaCrawl, the creators are listed in the reference. Wiki Titles and ASPEC might not have explicit creators mentioned, so I'll leave those fields empty if necessary.

Finally, I'll compile all this information into the JSON format as specified.
