Alright, I'm trying to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses transition systems and their application in NLP tasks like parsing. It mentions experiments on the PTB and UD datasets. So, I know PTB (Penn Treebank) and UD (Universal Dependencies) are datasets used here.

Next, I'll go through the sections where experiments are described. In the experiments section, the authors mention conducting experiments on the English Penn Treebank (PTB 3.0) and Universal Dependencies (UD) v2.2. They also refer to the CoNLL 2018 shared task, which uses UD treebanks.

I need to gather metadata for each dataset. For PTB, the creators are the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), and it's a corpus for English parsing. The UD dataset is created by an international community and covers multiple languages. The CoNLL 2018 shared task is organized by the CoNLL group.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields: creator, description, title, issued year, language, identifier, theme, keyword, landing page, version, format, and task.

For PTB, the title is "Penn Treebank," description is about English parsing, issued in 1993, language is English, and it's used for parsing tasks. UD is titled "Universal Dependencies," covers multiple languages, issued in 2018, and used for dependency parsing. CoNLL 2018 is about multilingual parsing, issued in 2018, and used for parsing tasks.

I'll ensure each dataset entry is accurate and follows the specified JSON format without any additional text.
