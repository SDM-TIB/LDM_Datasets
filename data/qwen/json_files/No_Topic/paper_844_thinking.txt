Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is titled "An Efficient Technique for De-noising Sentences using Monolingual Corpus and Synonym Dictionary" by Sanjay Chatterjee, Diptesh Chatterjee, and Sudeshna Sarkar. It was published in the Proceedings of COLING 2012: Demonstration Papers.

First, I'll read through the abstract to get an overview. The authors describe a method for correcting noisy sentences using a monolingual corpus and a synonym dictionary. They mention using this method as a post-processing system for their Bengali to Hindi and Hindi to Bengali machine translation systems.

Next, I'll look into the introduction and related work sections to see if they reference any datasets. The introduction talks about noisy sentences generated by humans or NLP systems, but doesn't mention specific datasets. The related work section references studies on error correction but doesn't cite any datasets used in those studies.

Moving on to the methodology section, the authors discuss their approach using a monolingual corpus and a synonym dictionary. They mention that they used Hindi and Bengali monolingual corpora crawled from the web. The size of these corpora is 300K and 430K sentences, respectively. They also used synonym dictionaries for Hindi and Bengali, a stemmer, and a phonetic mapping table.

In the experimental setup, they detail the resources used: the monolingual corpora, synonym dictionaries, stemmer, and phonetic mapping. They don't reference any external datasets beyond these resources.

Looking through the references, I don't see any citations to external datasets. The references are mostly to other research papers and methodologies.

So, the datasets mentioned in the paper are:
1. Hindi monolingual corpus (300K sentences)
2. Bengali monolingual corpus (430K sentences)
3. Hindi synonym dictionary
4. Bengali synonym dictionary

Each of these datasets is described in the paper, but they don't provide specific titles, creators, or identifiers beyond what's mentioned. The creators are the authors of the paper since they built these resources for their research. The description is based on how they were used in the paper. The language is Hindi and Bengali. The format is text. The tasks involve error correction and machine translation.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, noting that some fields like identifiers and landing pages aren't provided in the paper.
