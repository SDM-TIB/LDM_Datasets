Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses meta-learning and proposes a new regularization method called Minimax-Meta Regularization. It mentions experiments on few-shot learning and robust reweighting.

Looking into the experiments section, I see references to datasets used in the experiments. The datasets mentioned are Mini-Imagenet, Omniglot, and Sinusoids. 

1. **Mini-Imagenet**: This dataset is used for few-shot classification tasks. It's a subset of ImageNet with 600 images across 100 classes. The paper splits it into training, validation, and test sets. The creators are Ravi and Larochelle, and it was introduced in 2017.

2. **Omniglot**: This dataset is used for few-shot learning as well. It contains 1623 character classes from different alphabets, with 20 instances each. The creators are Lake et al., and it was introduced in 2015.

3. **Sinusoids**: This is a synthetic dataset used for few-shot regression tasks. It involves generating sine waves with varying amplitudes. The paper doesn't specify a creator or publication year, so those fields will be empty.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring that each field is filled based on the information provided in the paper. If a field isn't mentioned, I'll leave it empty.
