Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction. The abstract mentions the WAT 2022 shared translation task and the Parallel Data Filtering Task. It also references JParaCrawl v3.0 and ASPEC. These are likely datasets used in the study.

Moving to the introduction, the paper again mentions JParaCrawl v3.0 and ASPEC. It also refers to the test set from ASPEC. So, these are definitely datasets used in the research.

In the Data Selection section, the paper details the use of JParaCrawl (Morishita et al., 2020) and ASPEC (Nakazawa et al., 2016). It mentions that the models are built using data from JParaCrawl and evaluated on ASPEC's test set. Additionally, the paper refers to the ASPEC Dev set and ASPEC Train set, which are subsets of the ASPEC dataset.

Looking at the references, I find more details about JParaCrawl and ASPEC. JParaCrawl is a large-scale web-based English-Japanese parallel corpus, while ASPEC is a scientific domain parallel corpus used for evaluation.

I should also check if there are any other datasets mentioned. The paper doesn't reference any others beyond JParaCrawl and ASPEC. 

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information extracted:

1. **JParaCrawl v3.0**
   - **Creators**: Makoto Morishita, Jun Suzuki, Masaaki Nagata
   - **Description**: A large-scale web-based English-Japanese parallel corpus.
   - **Title**: JParaCrawl v3.0
   - **Year**: 2020
   - **Language**: English, Japanese
   - **Identifier**: DOI or URL if available, but not provided in the paper.
   - **Theme**: Machine Translation, Corpus
   - **Keywords**: Parallel corpus, web-based, English-Japanese
   - **Landing Page**: Not provided.
   - **Version**: v3.0
   - **Format**: Text
   - **Task**: Data selection for NMT

2. **ASPEC**
   - **Creators**: Toshiaki Nakazawa, Manabu Yaguchi, Kiyotaka Uchimoto, Masao Utiyama, Eiichiro Sumita, Sadao Kurohashi, Hitoshi Isahara
   - **Description**: A scientific domain parallel corpus.
   - **Title**: ASPEC
   - **Year**: 2016
   - **Language**: English, Japanese
   - **Identifier**: DOI or URL if available, but not provided in the paper.
   - **Theme**: Machine Translation, Corpus
   - **Keywords**: Scientific domain, parallel corpus
   - **Landing Page**: Not provided.
   - **Version**: Not specified
   - **Format**: Text
   - **Task**: Evaluation of NMT models

I need to ensure that all metadata fields are filled accurately based on the information available in the paper. If any fields are not mentioned, they should be left as empty strings or empty lists as per the instructions.

Finally, I'll compile the JSON response with the extracted datasets, ensuring that each dataset is correctly represented with all the required metadata fields.
