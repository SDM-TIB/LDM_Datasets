Alright, I'm trying to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses domain generalization and proposes a method called Variational Invariant Learning (VIL). It mentions using four widely used cross-domain visual recognition benchmarks for evaluation.

Looking into the methodology section, I don't see any datasets mentioned there. The focus is more on the theoretical framework and the proposed method.

In the experiments section, the datasets are clearly listed. The paper evaluates VIL on four datasets: PACS, Office-Home, Rotated MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST. Each of these datasets is described in terms of their structure and usage in the experiments.

For each dataset, I need to extract the metadata as per the given vocabulary. Let's break them down:

1. **PACS**: Created by Li et al. in 2017. It contains images from four domains (photo, art-painting, cartoon, sketch) with seven classes. The dataset is used for cross-domain visual recognition.

2. **Office-Home**: Introduced by Venkateswara et al. in 2017. It includes four domains (art, clipart, product, real-world) with 65 categories. Used for evaluating domain generalization.

3. **Rotated MNIST**: Part of the MNIST dataset, rotated by various angles to test out-of-distribution performance.

4. **Fashion-MNIST**: Similar to MNIST but with fashion items, also used in rotated versions for domain generalization.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring accuracy based on the paper's descriptions.
