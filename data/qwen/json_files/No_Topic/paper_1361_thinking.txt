Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, the paper is about clustering hidden Markov models (HMMs) using a variational hierarchical EM algorithm. The authors mention several applications and datasets where their algorithm is tested.

Looking through the paper, I notice that in Section 4, they discuss experiments on hierarchical motion clustering and automatic music tagging. Specifically, they reference the Motion Capture dataset and the CAL500 dataset.

The Motion Capture dataset is mentioned in the context of hierarchical clustering of motion sequences. It's a well-known dataset used for analyzing human motion, often containing data from various activities like walking, jumping, etc.

The CAL500 dataset is referenced in the music tagging experiment. CAL500 is a collection of 502 songs annotated with 149 tags, used for evaluating content-based music auto-tagging systems.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors don't reference any other datasets for their experiments or evaluations.

So, the two datasets identified are the Motion Capture dataset and the CAL500 dataset. I'll need to describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary.
