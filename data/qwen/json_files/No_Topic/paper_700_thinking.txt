Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "A MARVS Analysis of Two Chinese Near-Synonymous Verbs of Jumping Based on Chinese Corpora" by Yingying Peng. It discusses the analysis of two Chinese verbs using the MARVS framework and mentions two large Chinese corpora: GigaWord2 and the CCL corpus.

First, I'll look for mentions of these corpora in the paper. The GigaWord2 corpus is referenced in the introduction and methods section. It's described as containing over 800 million POS-tagged words from three varieties of Mandarin Chinese. The CCL corpus is also mentioned, developed by the Center for Chinese Linguistics at Peking University, containing 783 million Chinese characters.

Next, I'll check the references section for more details. The GigaWord2 corpus is cited as (Hong and Huang, 2006) and (Huang, 2009). The CCL corpus is cited as (Zhan et al., 2019).

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset using the specified vocabulary.

For GigaWord2:
- Creator: Hong and Huang (from the reference)
