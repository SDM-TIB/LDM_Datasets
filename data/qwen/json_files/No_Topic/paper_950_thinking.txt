Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses a Pictograph-to-Text translation system for people with IDD, using WordNet links and an n-gram language model. It mentions pictograph sets Sclera and Beta, but these are more like symbol sets rather than datasets.

Looking into the related work section, I don't see any datasets mentioned. The paper talks about other systems but doesn't reference datasets used in those works.

In the section about pictograph languages, it mentions Sclera and Beta pictographs again. These are sets of symbols, not datasets. The paper also refers to the WAI-NOT communication platform, which is a tool, not a dataset.

Moving to the architecture section, the system uses a trigram language model trained on several corpora. These include Europarl, CGN, CLEF, DGT-TM, and Wikipedia. These are all established datasets or corpora used in machine translation and NLP tasks.

The evaluation section mentions a test set of 50 Dutch messages from the WAI-NOT corpus, which were manually translated into pictographs. This indicates that the WAI-NOT corpus is a dataset used in their experiments.

In the references, I find more details about these corpora:
- Europarl is a multilingual corpus of European Parliament proceedings.
- CGN is the Corpus of Spoken Dutch.
- CLEF is a collection of resources for cross-language evaluation.
- DGT-TM is a translation memory corpus.
- Wikipedia is a large multilingual corpus.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. Europarl
2. CGN
3. CLEF
4. DGT-TM
5. Wikipedia
6. WAI-NOT corpus

Each of these is a dataset used for training or evaluation in the paper. I'll structure each with the required metadata fields based on the information provided.
