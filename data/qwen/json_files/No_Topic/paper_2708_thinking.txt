Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract talks about improving case prediction in SMT using subcategorization information but doesn't mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges in translating from English to German and mentions using a two-step procedure but doesn't reference datasets yet.

Moving on to the sections, I see that the paper discusses using Europarl and HGC (Huge German Corpus) data for extracting subcategorization information. Europarl is a well-known multilingual corpus, and HGC is a large German corpus. These are likely the datasets used in the research.

In the "Using subcategorization information" section, the authors mention extracting verb-noun tuples from Europarl and HGC. They also reference dependency-parsed data from these sources. This indicates that Europarl and HGC are the primary datasets used.

Additionally, the paper mentions using the Moses SMT package and GIZA++ for word alignment, but these are tools, not datasets. The evaluation uses the WMT-2009 test sets, which are standard datasets for machine translation evaluation.

So, the datasets identified are:
1. Europarl
2. Huge German Corpus (HGC)
3. WMT-2009 test sets

Now, I'll extract the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
