Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Automatic Propbank Generation for Turkish" by Koray Ak and Olcay Taner Yalçın. It discusses the creation of an automatic Turkish PropBank using parallel data from English PropBank.

First, I'll look for any datasets mentioned in the abstract, introduction, and methods sections. The abstract mentions PropBank, so that's one dataset. The introduction also references PropBank and FrameNet. 

In the methods section, the authors mention using the English PropBank and the Penn Treebank. They also reference the ITU-METU-Sabancı Treebank (IMST) and the Turkish Proposition Bank created by Ak et al. (2018).

Now, I'll check the references to find more details about these datasets. The references include:

- FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2004)
- PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002, 2003, 2005)
- NomBank (2004)
- ITU-METU-Sabancı Treebank (IMST)
- Turkish Proposition Bank (Ak et al., 2018)

I'll gather metadata for each of these datasets, including creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, languages, and themes. For some datasets, like FrameNet and PropBank, I'll use the information from the references provided in the paper.

Finally, I'll structure this information into JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described based on the paper's usage and descriptions.
