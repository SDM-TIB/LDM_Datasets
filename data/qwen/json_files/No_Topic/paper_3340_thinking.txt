Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about parsing morphologically rich languages and mentions several datasets used in their experiments. 

First, I'll go through the paper to identify any datasets. The authors mention several treebanks for different languages. For example, they reference the Arabic Treebank, Basque Treebank, French Treebank, Hebrew Treebank, German Treebank, Hungarian Treebank, Korean Treebank, Polish Treebank, and Swedish Treebank. Each of these is a dataset used for parsing.

Next, I'll look for the creators of each dataset. The paper cites the authors or institutions responsible for each treebank. For instance, the Arabic Treebank is cited to Maamouri et al., the Basque Treebank to Aduriz et al., and so on.

I'll then describe each dataset based on how the authors used them. They were used for parsing and evaluating the performance of their parsing models on morphologically rich languages.

The titles of the datasets are straightforward, like "Arabic Treebank" or "French Treebank." The issued year varies, so I'll extract those from the references provided in the paper.

Since each treebank is in a specific language, I'll note the language for each. The format is typically text, as they are treebanks with syntactic annotations.

For themes, I'll categorize them under "Natural Language Processing" and "Parsing." The keywords will include terms like "Treebank," "Parsing," and the specific language.

The landing page URLs aren't provided in the paper, so I'll leave those empty. Versions aren't explicitly mentioned, so those fields will be empty as well.

Finally, the tasks these datasets are used for include parsing and evaluating parsing models, so I'll list those under "mls:task."

I'll structure all this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described based on the paper's content.
