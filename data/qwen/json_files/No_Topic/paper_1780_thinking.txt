Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper's title is "Learning Rare Category Classifiers on a Tight Labeling Budget" by Ravi Teja Mullapudi and others. The abstract mentions datasets like iNaturalist and Places, which are likely the datasets used in their experiments.

Looking into the introduction, the authors discuss real-world applications but don't mention specific datasets yet. Moving to the related work section, they reference prior work but not datasets. 

In the evaluation section (Section 4), the authors explicitly mention two datasets:
1. **iNaturalist**: They used 50 categories from this dataset, each being rare (0.01-0.26% of the data).
2. **Places**: They used 20 categories from this dataset, each also rare (0.19-0.27% of the data).

These datasets are used to evaluate their approach for rare category classification. The authors provide details on how they selected categories and the imbalance in the data, which helps in describing the datasets.

I should now structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset includes the necessary metadata fields as per the vocabulary provided.
