Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "A Large Rated Lexicon with French Medical Words" by Natalia Grabar and Thierry Hamon. The abstract mentions the creation of a lexicon where medical words in French are rated by annotators. The authors also reference the source terminology used, which is Snomed International in French.

Looking through the sections, the "Description of the Source Terminology" section mentions that the source terms are obtained from Snomed International in French. This indicates that Snomed International is the dataset used in their work.

I should check if there are any other datasets mentioned. The paper discusses the annotation process and the creation of their own lexicon, but the only external dataset referenced is Snomed International.

Now, I need to gather the metadata for Snomed International. The creators are listed as the authors of the dataset, which in this case is the College of Europe (CEotA e) as mentioned in the paper. The description should reflect that it's a medical terminology dataset in French. The title is "Snomed International (French Version)". The year is 1996, as cited in the paper. The language is French. The identifier is the URL provided: http://esante.gouv.fr/services/referentiels/referentiels-d-interoperabilite/snomed-35vf. The themes are "Medical Terminology" and "Healthcare". Keywords include "Medical terms", "French", and "Healthcare". The landing page is the same as the identifier. There's no specific version mentioned, so that field remains empty. The format is text, and the task is "Medical Terminology".

I should ensure that all fields are correctly filled based on the information provided in the paper. No other datasets are mentioned, so only Snomed International is included.
