Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "WMDO: Fluency-based Word Moveras Distance for Machine Translation Evaluation" by Julian Chow, Pranava Madhyastha, and Lucia Specia. It's about a new metric for evaluating machine translations, which incorporates word order into the Word Mover's Distance (WMD) metric.

Looking through the sections, I find that in Section 3.1, the authors mention the datasets they used for their experiments. Specifically, they refer to the WMT17 segment-level into-English datasets. 

I need to check if there are any other datasets mentioned. Scanning through the rest of the paper, I don't find any additional datasets. The references section doesn't list any other datasets used in the experiments.

Now, I'll gather the metadata for the WMT17 dataset. The creators are the authors of the dataset, which in this case, the paper cites Ondrej Bojar, Yvette Graham, and Amir Kamran as the creators. The description is based on how the authors used the dataset: it's a collection of texts in seven different source languages with reference and machine translations. The title is "WMT17 Metrics Shared Task Dataset." The year it was published is 2017. The language is English, as it's the target language. The format is text, and the task is machine translation evaluation.

I don't find any specific version mentioned, so that field remains empty. There's no landing page or identifier provided in the paper, so those fields are left empty. The themes are machine translation and evaluation, and the keywords include machine translation, evaluation metrics, and WMT.

I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring all fields are correctly filled based on the dataset's description in the paper.
