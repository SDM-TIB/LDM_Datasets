Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract to get an overview. It mentions Automatic Post-Editing (APE) and refers to WMT, which is the Conference on Machine Translation. WMT is known for providing datasets, so that's a potential dataset.

Moving to the introduction, the paper discusses the limitations of existing APE datasets, especially for various language pairs. It mentions that WMT provides limited data, like 7,000 training and 1,000 validation/test data for En-De and En-Zh. So, WMT datasets are definitely mentioned here.

In the related studies section, the paper references eSCAPE, which uses parallel data to generate APE data. It also mentions Lee et al. (2020) and Moon et al. (2021a), but I don't see specific datasets named there beyond the methods.

Looking at the experimental results, the paper uses a Korean-English (Ko-En) parallel corpus from AIHub. This is explicitly mentioned as the dataset used for their experiments. The corpus includes 1.6 million sentence pairs across six domains.

I also check the references for any additional datasets. The paper cites several studies but doesn't mention other datasets beyond WMT and the AIHub corpus.

So, the datasets identified are:
1. WMT datasets (specifically for En-De and En-Zh)
2. AIHub Ko-En parallel corpus

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
