Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about adversarial robustness in the directions of the data manifold, using generative models like GANs and VAEs. 

First, I'll go through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract and introduction don't mention specific datasets, but the experiments section does. 

Looking at the experiments section, I see that they used MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. MNIST is a well-known dataset of handwritten digits, and CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 10 classes of small images. 

I need to describe each dataset using the specified metadata vocabulary. For MNIST, the creators are Yann LeCun, LÃ©on Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. The description should reflect how the paper used it, focusing on adversarial examples and robustness. The title is "MNIST," published in 1998. It's in English, and the format is image. The themes are Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Keywords include handwritten digits, adversarial examples, and robustness. The task is image classification.

For CIFAR-10, the creator is Alex Krizhevsky. The description mentions its use for evaluating adversarial robustness. The title is "CIFAR-10," published in 2009. It's in English, with an image format. Themes are Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Keywords include image classification, adversarial examples, and robustness. The task is image classification.

I need to ensure that all fields are correctly filled based on the paper's usage and available information. Since the paper doesn't provide DOIs or URLs for these datasets, those fields remain empty.
