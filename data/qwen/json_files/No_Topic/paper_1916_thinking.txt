Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about training with growing sets as an alternative to curriculum and self-paced learning. It's an anonymous submission to ICLR 2018.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets are mentioned. The abstract talks about experiments with different training methods but doesn't mention specific datasets. The introduction references various studies but doesn't list datasets used in this paper.

Moving on to the Methods section, I see they mention using 36 datasets from the UCI repository. That's a key point. The datasets are used to test their methods, but the paper doesn't list each one individually. Instead, it refers to them collectively as datasets from the UCI repository.

In the Implementation section, they specify that they tested their methods on 36 datasets from the UCI repository. These datasets vary in size, features, and classes. However, the paper doesn't provide the names of these datasets or their specific details beyond their general characteristics.

Looking through the rest of the paper, there's no mention of other datasets. The references section lists various studies but doesn't include specific datasets beyond the UCI ones.

So, the main dataset mentioned is the collection from the UCI repository, but the paper doesn't list each dataset individually. Therefore, the only dataset information we can extract is that they used datasets from the UCI repository, but without specific names or details.
