Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper's abstract mentions experiments conducted on the MNIST dataset and the CIFAR10 dataset. These are well-known datasets in machine learning, so I should look for more details about their usage in the paper.

In the introduction, the authors discuss their approach to interpreting deep classification models. They mention using these datasets to evaluate their method. The methods section details how they applied their technique to pre-trained models on MNIST and CIFAR10.

Looking at the experiment setup, the authors specify that they used the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit classification and the CIFAR10 dataset for object recognition. They reference the TensorFlow official website for the structures of these models, which suggests that the datasets are standard versions.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The focus is on MNIST and CIFAR10, both of which are widely used benchmarks in machine learning.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   - **Creators**: Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges.
   - **Description**: A dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training and testing in machine learning.
   - **Title**: MNIST
   - **Issued**: 1998
   - **Theme**: Computer Vision, Machine Learning
   - **Keywords**: Handwritten digits, Classification
   - **Format**: Image
   - **Task**: Image Classification

2. **CIFAR10 Dataset**:
   - **Creators**: Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, and others.
   - **Description**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, used for object recognition.
   - **Title**: CIFAR10
   - **Issued**: 2009
   - **Theme**: Computer Vision, Machine Learning
   - **Keywords**: Object recognition, Image classification
   - **Format**: Image
   - **Task**: Image Classification

I'll ensure that each dataset's metadata is accurately captured based on the paper's description and standard references.
