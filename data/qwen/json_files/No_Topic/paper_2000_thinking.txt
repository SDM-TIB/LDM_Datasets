Alright, I'm looking at the provided paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper is about a Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) system submission to SemEval 2015. 

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction. The abstract mentions the competition and datasets used, but doesn't name specific datasets. The introduction talks about the STS task but doesn't list datasets.

Moving to the sections, Section 2 discusses the UMBC PairingWords system, which uses a distributional model built on a 3-billion-word corpus. This corpus is mentioned as the UMBC WebBase corpus, available at a specific URL. 

Section 3 describes the Align-and-Differentiate approach, which uses WordNet for semantic differentiation. WordNet is a well-known lexical database, so that's another dataset.

In the results section, Table 1 lists datasets used in the competition: headlines, images, students, forums, and belief. These are the five evaluation datasets from SemEval 2015 Task 2.

Additionally, the references mention WordNet and the UMBC WebBase corpus. 

So, the datasets identified are:
1. UMBC WebBase corpus
2. WordNet
3. SemEval 2015 Task 2 datasets (headlines, images, students, forums, belief)

Each of these will be described with the required metadata fields.
