Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided SIGDIAL 2019 conference proceedings. The user has given me a detailed document, and I need to identify all the datasets mentioned. 

First, I'll start by skimming through the document to find any mentions of datasets. I notice that the document includes a table of contents and several paper titles. Each paper might reference datasets, so I'll need to look through each one.

Looking at the table of contents, I see papers like "Deep Reinforcement Learning For Modeling Chit-Chat Dialog With Discrete Attributes" by Chinnadhurai Sankar and Sujith Ravi. I don't see any dataset names here, but maybe the full paper mentions some. 

Next, I check the paper titled "TDDiscourse: A Dataset for Discourse-Level Temporal Ordering of Events" by Aakanksha Naik, Luke Breitfeller, and Carolyn Rose. This seems promising because the title mentions a dataset. I'll note this as one dataset.

Continuing through the list, I find another paper: "FriendsQA: Open-Domain Question Answering on TV Show Transcripts" by Zhengzhe Yang and Jinho D. Choi. This also mentions a dataset, FriendsQA, which is based on TV show transcripts.

I also come across "A Quantitative Analysis of Patients' Narratives of Heart Failure" by Sabita Acharya and others. This paper might use a dataset of patient narratives, but the title doesn't specify a named dataset, so I'm unsure if it's a new dataset or an existing one.

Another paper, "Characterizing the Response Space of Questions: a Corpus Study for English and Polish" by Jonathan Ginzburg and others, mentions a corpus study but doesn't name a specific dataset.

I should also check the references section for any dataset citations. However, the provided document doesn't include the full references, so I can't extract more information from there.

In summary, I've identified two datasets: TDDiscourse and FriendsQA. I'll need to extract their metadata based on the information provided in the papers.
