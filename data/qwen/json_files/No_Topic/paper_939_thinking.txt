Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses language service infrastructures and their interoperability. It mentions several platforms like the Language Grid, META-SHARE, DKPro, and CLARIN as Weblicht. These are more like platforms or tools rather than datasets.

Looking at the sections, the first part introduces language service infrastructures. The authors mention Kathaa, Galaxy, Model Investigator, Language Service ontology, and Kachako API. These are systems or tools, not datasets.

In the second part, they discuss language service applications. Nakaguchi et al. developed a multi-language support system using the Language Grid. Assawinjaipetch et al. used deep learning with word embeddings for complaint classification. Again, these are applications, not datasets.

The third part focuses on language resources and services, especially for low-resource languages. Aili and Mushajiang converted the Uyghur dependency Treebank to universal dependencies. Luong and Vu used Kaldi for Vietnamese speech recognition. Lu et al. evaluated an ensemble-based pre-annotation approach for named entity corpus construction.

From this, the datasets mentioned are:
1. Uyghur dependency Treebank
2. Vietnamese Speech Recognition System (using Kaldi)
3. Named Entity Corpus (used in ensemble-based pre-annotation)

I need to extract metadata for each. However, the paper doesn't provide detailed descriptions, creators, or URLs for these datasets. Therefore, I'll note them with available information.
