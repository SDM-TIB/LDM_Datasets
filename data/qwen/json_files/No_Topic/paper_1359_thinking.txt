Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions two datasets: one from computer science and another from English reading comprehension. These are used to evaluate the proposed technique.

Moving to the introduction, the paper discusses the task of automatic short answer grading (ASAG) and mentions two datasets. The first is from Mohler et al. (2011), which is an undergraduate computer science dataset. The second is a high-school English reading comprehension task that the authors intend to share with the community.

In the data section, the paper explicitly states that they evaluate their methods on two datasets: the CSDataset and the RCDataset. The CSDataset is from Mohler et al. (2011) and includes 87 questions with student responses. The RCDataset is a high-school reading comprehension task with 14 questions and responses from 58 students.

I'll check the references to find more details about these datasets. The CSDataset is cited as Mohler et al., 2011, and the RCDataset is described in the paper as a new dataset the authors plan to share.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided.

For the CSDataset:
- **Creator**: Michael Mohler, Razvan Bunescu, Rada Mihalcea (authors of the referenced paper)
- **Description**: Undergraduate computer science dataset with 87 questions and student answers.
- **Title**: CSDataset
- **Issued**: 2011
- **Language**: English
- **Theme**: Education, Natural Language Processing
- **Keywords**: Short answer grading, Computer science, Student answers
- **Format**: Text
- **Task**: Automatic short answer grading

For the RCDataset:
- **Creator**: The authors of the current paper (Oliver Adams, Shourya Roy, Raghuram Krishnapuram)
- **Description**: High-school English reading comprehension dataset with 14 questions and 58 student responses.
- **Title**: RCDataset
- **Issued**: 2016 (since the paper was published in 2016)
- **Language**: English
- **Theme**: Education, Natural Language Processing
- **Keywords**: Reading comprehension, High school, Student answers
- **Format**: Text
- **Task**: Automatic short answer grading

I'll ensure that each dataset is accurately described with the appropriate metadata fields.
