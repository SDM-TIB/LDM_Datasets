Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions "DeepMind Lab" and "MuJoCo" environments, which are simulation platforms used for reinforcement learning tasks. These are not datasets per se but environments where datasets might be generated or used.

Moving on to the sections, I see that the paper discusses experiments conducted in "DeepMind Lab" and "MuJoCo" environments. These environments are used to test the DARLA agent's performance in domain adaptation scenarios. While these are not datasets, they might involve datasets internally for training and testing.

In the "Tasks" section, the paper describes experiments in DeepMind Lab and MuJoCo. For DeepMind Lab, the tasks involve seek-avoid object gathering, where the agent must pick up certain objects and avoid others. This setup likely uses datasets of object types and room configurations. Similarly, the MuJoCo experiments involve a Jaco arm performing reaching tasks, which would require datasets of arm positions, object positions, and camera angles.

The "Results" section mentions the performance of DARLA in these environments, but it doesn't explicitly reference any datasets. However, the environments themselves are built upon datasets of visual observations and state representations.

In the "References" section, I look for any citations that might point to datasets. The references include works on reinforcement learning, visual representations, and simulation environments, but none explicitly cite datasets. However, the use of DeepMind Lab and MuJoCo implies that these environments utilize datasets for their simulations.

Given the information, the datasets are likely embedded within the DeepMind Lab and MuJoCo environments. These datasets include visual observations, object configurations, and state representations used to train and test the DARLA agent.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information extracted from the paper.
