Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about a Spatio-Temporal Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (STMARL) approach for cooperative traffic light control. 

First, I'll go through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned. The paper mentions several datasets in the context of experiments and simulations. 

Looking at the "5 EXPERIMENTS" section, there are references to synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. The synthetic datasets are described as "U nidirec6A6" and "Bidirect6A6," which are grid networks used for testing the model under various traffic patterns. 

The real-world datasets mentioned are "DHangzhou" and "DHef ei." DHangzhou is a publicly available dataset from Hangzhou, China, and DHef ei is collected from Hefei, China. These datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the STMARL model in real-world scenarios.

I need to extract metadata for each of these datasets. For each dataset, I'll look for the creator, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For DHangzhou and DHef ei, the creators are not explicitly mentioned in the paper, so I'll leave that field empty. The descriptions are based on how the datasets are used in the paper. The titles are the names of the datasets. The publication years are not provided, so they'll be empty. The language is not specified, so it's empty. Identifiers like DOIs or URLs are not provided, so those fields are empty. The themes are related to transportation and traffic management. Keywords include traffic data, real-world, and city-specific names. Landing pages are not provided, so they're empty. Versions are not mentioned, so that's empty. The format is not specified, so it's empty. The tasks are related to traffic light control and optimization.

For the synthetic datasets, the creators are the authors of the paper, as they generated these datasets. The descriptions are based on the grid networks and traffic patterns used. The titles are the names of the synthetic datasets. The publication year is the year of the paper, which is 2020. The language is English. Identifiers are not provided, so they're empty. Themes are related to transportation and simulation. Keywords include synthetic data, grid network, and traffic simulation. Landing pages are not provided, so they're empty. Versions are not mentioned, so that's empty. The format is not specified, so it's empty. The tasks are related to traffic light control and optimization.

I'll structure each dataset with the appropriate metadata fields based on the information extracted from the paper.
