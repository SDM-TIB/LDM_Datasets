Alright, I'm looking at the provided research paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper is about a new reinforcement learning agent called Reactor. It mentions several algorithms and their performance on the Atari 2600 games. 

In the introduction, it references the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) which is used for evaluating agents on Atari games. The ALE is a framework that provides access to a suite of Atari 2600 games for reinforcement learning research. 

The paper also mentions Rainbow, which is another reinforcement learning algorithm, but it doesn't introduce a new dataset. The experiments are conducted on the same Atari 2600 games as previous works. 

So, the main dataset mentioned is the Atari 2600 games provided through the Arcade Learning Environment. I'll extract this as the dataset used in the paper.
