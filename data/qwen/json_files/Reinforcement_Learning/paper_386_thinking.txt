Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Count-Based Exploration with Neural Density Models" by Georg Ostrovski, Marc G. Bellemare, Aaron van den Oord, and RÃ©mi Munos. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to understand the context. The paper discusses using neural density models, specifically PixelCNN, for exploration in reinforcement learning, particularly in the context of Atari 2600 games. 

Looking through the sections, I notice that the paper mentions several datasets and environments used for evaluation. The primary environment mentioned is the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), which is a suite of Atari 2600 games. The paper evaluates their approach on various games within this environment, such as Montezuma's Revenge, Private Eye, Venture, and others.

I also see references to specific games like FREEWAY, GRAVITAR, and others. These are all part of the Atari 2600 dataset provided by the ALE. The paper doesn't mention any other external datasets beyond the games within the ALE.

To summarize, the main dataset used in this paper is the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), which includes a collection of Atari 2600 games. The paper evaluates their methods on several games within this dataset, focusing on those with challenging exploration requirements.

Now, I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring that each dataset is described with the appropriate metadata fields.
