Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

The paper is titled "FinRL: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Library for Automated Stock Trading in Quantitative Finance" and is authored by several researchers from Columbia University and other institutions. The abstract mentions that the FinRL library uses stock market datasets, including NASDAQ-100, DJIA, S&P 500, HSI, SSE 50, and CSI 300. These are all stock market indices, so they can be considered datasets.

In the introduction, the authors discuss the use of real historical data from these indices to simulate trading environments. They also mention that users can import their own datasets, but since the paper doesn't specify any particular external datasets beyond the indices, I'll focus on those.

Looking through the sections, the authors elaborate on the environments provided by FinRL, which are based on these indices. Each index represents a dataset of historical stock prices and related data. The paper doesn't provide specific creators for these datasets beyond the indices themselves, so I'll note that the creators are the respective stock exchanges or index providers.

The datasets are described as containing features like closing price, shares, trading volume, technical indicators, etc. They are used for training and evaluating deep reinforcement learning agents in stock trading. The format of these datasets isn't explicitly stated, but they are likely in a structured format such as CSV or similar, suitable for financial analysis.

Since the paper doesn't provide specific URLs or DOIs for these datasets, the landing page and identifier fields will remain empty. The themes are related to quantitative finance and stock trading, and the keywords include stock trading, reinforcement learning, and financial datasets.

Each dataset is associated with the task of automated stock trading, which is the primary application of the FinRL library. The versions aren't specified, so that field remains empty.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the metadata fields provided, ensuring that all relevant information is included accurately.
