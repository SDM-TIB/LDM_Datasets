Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses learning transferable architectures for scalable image recognition. It mentions CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, which are commonly used in image classification tasks.

Looking into the introduction, the authors reference CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, used for architecture search. ImageNet is a large dataset with over 1.2 million high-resolution images across 1000 classes, used for evaluating the scalability of their models.

In the experiments section, the authors also mention the COCO dataset for object detection. COCO is a large-scale dataset for object detection, segmentation, and captioning, containing over 330,000 images with 80 object categories.

I'll check the references for more details on each dataset. CIFAR-10 is cited as reference [31], ImageNet as [11], and COCO as [38]. Each reference provides the necessary details like creators, publication year, and usage.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the metadata fields:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   - Creators: Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, Geoffrey E. Hinton.
   - Description: 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
   - Title: CIFAR-10.
   - Issued: 2009.
   - Theme: Computer Vision, Image Classification.
   - Keywords: Image classification, 32x32 images.
   - Task: Image classification.

2. **ImageNet**:
   - Creators: Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, etc.
   - Description: Over 1.2 million images across 1000 classes.
   - Title: ImageNet.
   - Issued: 2009.
   - Theme: Computer Vision, Large-scale classification.
   - Keywords: Large-scale, 1000 classes.
   - Task: Image classification.

3. **COCO**:
   - Creators: Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, et al.
   - Description: Over 330,000 images with 80 object categories.
   - Title: COCO.
   - Issued: 2014.
   - Theme: Computer Vision, Object detection.
   - Keywords: Object detection, segmentation.
   - Task: Object detection.

I'll ensure each field is filled accurately based on the paper's description and references. If any details are missing, I'll leave the field empty as per instructions.
