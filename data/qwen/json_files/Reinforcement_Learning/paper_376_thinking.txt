Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses counterfactual explanations in the context of the GDPR and uses examples from machine learning datasets. 

Looking at Section III, there are mentions of two datasets: LSAT and PIMA Diabetes. 

1. **LSAT Dataset**: This is a stripped-down version used in fairness literature to predict students' first-year average grade based on race, GPA, and entrance exam scores. It's cited in references 65 and 66.

2. **PIMA Diabetes Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict the risk of diabetes in women of Pima heritage. It's mentioned in reference 68.

I'll check the references section to find more details about these datasets. 

- **LSAT Dataset**: Referenced in papers by Russell et al. (2017) and Kusner et al. (2017).
- **PIMA Diabetes Dataset**: Referenced in a study by Smith et al. (1988).

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper and references.
