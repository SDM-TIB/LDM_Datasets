Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about using genetic algorithms for training deep neural networks in reinforcement learning tasks. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of the datasets used. The abstract mentions Atari games and humanoid locomotion in the MuJoCo simulator. So, I know Atari and MuJoCo are involved.

Looking at the introduction, it references the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) for Atari games and the MuJoCo simulator for robotics tasks. These are likely the datasets or environments used.

In the methods section, the paper details the use of the Atari 2600 environment with specific games like Frostbite, Gravitar, etc. They also mention the Humanoid Locomotion task in MuJoCo. 

The results section discusses performance on these Atari games and the humanoid task, confirming their use as datasets.

I'll check the references for more details. The Atari environment is cited as Bellemare et al., 2013, and MuJoCo is cited as Todorov et al., 2012. 

So, the datasets are:
1. Atari 2600 games (part of ALE)
2. MuJoCo Humanoid Locomotion task

Each dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the genetic algorithm in reinforcement learning tasks.
