Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Continual Learning with Deep Generative Replay" by Hanul Shin and others. It discusses a framework for continual learning using deep generative models. 

Looking through the sections, I find that the authors conducted experiments on image classification tasks. Specifically, they mention the MNIST dataset and the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.

In the experiments section, they test their model on MNIST, which is a well-known dataset of handwritten digits. They also perform experiments on SVHN, which contains images of house numbers. 

I don't see any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference these datasets in their experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their generative replay framework.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
