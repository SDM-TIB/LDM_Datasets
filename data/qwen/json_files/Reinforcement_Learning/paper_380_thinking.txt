Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks" by Chelsea Finn, Pieter Abbeel, and Sergey Levine. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML), which is a method for training models to adapt quickly to new tasks. It mentions applications in few-shot image classification, regression, and reinforcement learning.

Looking into the sections, I find that the authors conducted experiments on several datasets. In the "Experimental Evaluation" section, they mention the Omniglot dataset and MiniImagenet. 

Omniglot is a dataset of handwritten characters from various alphabets, often used for few-shot learning tasks. MiniImagenet is a dataset derived from ImageNet, structured for few-shot learning with classes divided into training, validation, and test sets.

I also note that the authors used synthetic sinusoid regression tasks for their experiments, but these aren't datasets in the traditional sense but rather generated data points.

So, the datasets explicitly mentioned are Omniglot and MiniImagenet. I'll need to gather metadata for each, including creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, themes, keywords, and tasks.

For Omniglot, the creators are Brenden M. Lake, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Jason Gross, and Joshua B. Tenenbaum, published in 2011. It's used for few-shot classification tasks.

MiniImagenet was introduced by Sachin Ravi and Hugo Larochelle in 2017, structured for few-shot learning with image data.

I'll structure this information into JSON format, ensuring each dataset has the required metadata fields.
