Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about reinforcement learning and introduces a surrogate agent-environment interface. It mentions several experiments and algorithms, but I need to focus on identifying any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract talks about the surrogate agent-environment interface and the PSADPG algorithm, but doesn't mention any specific datasets. The introduction discusses reinforcement learning and mentions some algorithms like DQN, but again, no datasets are cited here.

Moving on to the methodology section, the paper describes the surrogate agent-environment interface and the PSADPG algorithm. It mentions experiments conducted using OpenAI Gym environments, specifically Acrobot-v1 and Amidar-v0. These are part of the OpenAI Gym suite, which is a collection of environments for reinforcement learning research.

In the experiment section, the authors detail their tests on the Acrobot-v1 and Amidar-v0 environments. They also reference the Atari 2600 game environment, which is another set of environments provided by OpenAI Gym. The paper doesn't cite external datasets beyond these environments, as the focus is on algorithm development and testing within these standard RL environments.

Looking at the references, the paper cites the OpenAI Gym (Brockman et al., 2016) and the Arcade Learning Environment (Bellemare et al., 2013), which are frameworks for creating and using reinforcement learning environments. These aren't datasets per se but rather platforms that include datasets or environments for training and testing RL agents.

Since the paper doesn't reference any external datasets beyond these environments, the datasets to extract are the OpenAI Gym environments: Acrobot-v1, Amidar-v0, and the Atari 2600 games. Each of these is a standard environment used in reinforcement learning research, providing specific tasks and reward structures for training agents.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper. The creators are the authors of the OpenAI Gym and Arcade Learning Environment papers. The descriptions are based on how the paper uses these environments. The titles are the names of the environments. The issued year is taken from the references. The themes are related to reinforcement learning and game environments. Keywords include reinforcement learning, game environments, and specific environment names. The landing pages are the URLs of the respective frameworks. The format is text-based as these environments provide state representations and actions. The tasks are related to reinforcement learning and game playing.

I need to ensure that each dataset is correctly identified and that the metadata fields are accurately filled based on the information available in the paper. Since the paper doesn't provide specific DOIs or URLs for the individual environments, I'll use the URLs of the frameworks as the landing pages.
