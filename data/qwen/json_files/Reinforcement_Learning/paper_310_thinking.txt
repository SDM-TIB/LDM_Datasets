Alright, I'm looking at the provided research paper to identify the datasets mentioned. The paper is about an interpretable attention-based graph convolutional network for disease prediction. 

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions two datasets: Tadpole and UKBB. 

Next, I'll check the methods and experiments sections for more details. In the experiments section, the authors describe using the Tadpole dataset for Alzheimer's disease prediction and the UKBB dataset for age and gender prediction. 

I'll look up the references to find more information about these datasets. The Tadpole dataset is referenced as [21], and the UKBB as [22]. 

For Tadpole, the creators are listed as Marinescu et al., and it's a dataset used for predicting Alzheimer's disease. The UKBB dataset is created by Miller et al. and contains data from the UK Biobank study.

I'll extract the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper and references.
