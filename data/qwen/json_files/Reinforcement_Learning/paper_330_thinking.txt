Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses semantic parsing of large-scale 3D point clouds using a deep reinforcement learning framework. It mentions datasets used for experiments.

In the "Experiments" section, two datasets are explicitly mentioned:

1. **Stanford 3D Semantic Parsing Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and testing the proposed method. It contains 3D scans from Matterport scanners with 12 semantic classes.

2. **SUNCG Dataset**: This dataset is used for additional experiments. It contains 45,622 house models with 84 classes.

I'll check the references for more details on these datasets. The Stanford dataset is cited as [1], and SUNCG is cited as [26]. 

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
