Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about distributional reinforcement learning with quantile regression. Let me go through the paper step by step to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, the abstract mentions evaluating the new algorithm on the Atari 2600 games. So, the Atari 2600 games dataset is definitely one of the datasets used here.

Looking further into the introduction, there's a mention of the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) which is used for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms on Atari 2600 games. This confirms that the Atari 2600 games dataset is indeed a key dataset used in this research.

In the experimental results section, the authors evaluate their algorithm on the same suite of Atari 2600 games. They also mention using a windy gridworld domain, but that seems to be a custom environment rather than a standard dataset.

Additionally, the authors reference the work of Bellemare et al. (2013) which introduced the Arcade Learning Environment. This further solidifies that the Atari 2600 games dataset is the primary dataset used in this paper.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned beyond the Atari 2600 games. The paper doesn't reference any other standard datasets like ImageNet, MNIST, or others. All experiments are centered around the Atari 2600 games, so that's the only dataset to extract.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for the Atari 2600 games dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
