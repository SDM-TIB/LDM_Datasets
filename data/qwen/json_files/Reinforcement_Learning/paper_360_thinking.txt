Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses using human demonstrations to pre-train neural networks for deep reinforcement learning, specifically in Atari games. It mentions using the Atari 2600 games Pong, Freeway, and Beamrider for evaluation.

Looking into the methodology, the authors collected human demonstrations using OpenAI Gym's keyboard interface. They played five rounds for each game, collecting game frames, actions, rewards, and terminal states. The data was stored in an experience replay memory format.

In the results section, they reference the Atari 2600 environment and the human demonstrations used for pre-training. They also mention comparing their approach with existing work, such as the dataset from Bellemare et al. (2013), which is the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE).

I'll check the references for any additional datasets. The paper cites Bellemare et al. (2013) for the ALE, which is a standard benchmark for reinforcement learning. This dataset includes various Atari games and is widely used in the field.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. Human demonstrations collected for Pong, Freeway, and Beamrider.
2. The Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) by Bellemare et al.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields.
