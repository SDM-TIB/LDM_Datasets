Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses parameter space noise for exploration in deep reinforcement learning. It mentions several environments and benchmarks used for evaluation.

In the "EXPERIMENTS" section, the authors describe experiments using the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) and OpenAI Gym. They also reference rllab for some environments. Additionally, they mention using the DQN algorithm on 21 games from ALE and various continuous control tasks from Gym.

Looking deeper, the environments used include:
1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: This is a benchmark for reinforcement learning, providing a suite of Atari 2600 games.
2. **OpenAI Gym**: A collection of environments for reinforcement learning, including continuous control tasks like HalfCheetah, Hopper, etc.
3. **rllab**: Another library for reinforcement learning, used for environments like SparseCartpoleSwingup.

I need to extract each of these datasets, gather their metadata, and format them into JSON according to the specified vocabulary.

For each dataset:
- **dcterms:creator**: The authors or creators of the dataset.
- **dcterms:description**: A brief description of the dataset as used in the paper.
- **dcterms:title**: The name of the dataset.
- **dcterms:issued**: The year the dataset was published, if available.
- **dcterms:language**: Not applicable for these datasets.
- **dcterms:identifier**: DOI or URL if available.
- **dcat:theme**: Thematic categories.
- **dcat:keyword**: Relevant keywords.
- **dcat:landingPage**: URL to access the dataset.
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Specific version if mentioned.
- **dcterms:format**: Format of the data.
- **mls:task**: Tasks for which the dataset is used.

Now, I'll gather the necessary information for each dataset mentioned.

1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**:
   - Created by Bellemare et al. (2013).
   - Description: A suite of Atari 2600 games used for reinforcement learning evaluation.
   - Landing page: http://www.arcadelearningenvironment.org/
   - Tasks: Reinforcement learning, game playing.

2. **OpenAI Gym**:
   - Created by Brockman et al. (2016).
   - Description: A collection of environments for reinforcement learning, including continuous control tasks.
   - Landing page: https://github.com/openai/gym
   - Tasks: Reinforcement learning, control tasks.

3. **rllab**:
   - Created by Duan et al. (2016).
   - Description: A library for reinforcement learning, used for environments with sparse rewards.
   - Landing page: https://github.com/openai/rllab
   - Tasks: Reinforcement learning, sparse reward environments.

I'll format each of these into the required JSON structure, ensuring all fields are filled appropriately based on the information available.
