Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper introduces the Feedback Transformer architecture, which addresses some limitations of Transformers. It mentions various tasks and experiments conducted, but I'm specifically looking for datasets.

Looking through the sections, I find that the paper uses several datasets for evaluation. In the "EXPERIMENTS" section, they mention tasks like machine translation, language modeling, and reinforcement learning. 

1. **WMT14 En-De**: This is a standard dataset for machine translation, translating English to German. It's referenced in the paper when discussing translation tasks.

2. **WikiText-103**: A large-scale language modeling dataset derived from Wikipedia. The paper uses it to evaluate the performance of their model in language modeling tasks.

3. **Enwiki8**: Another language modeling dataset, this one is character-level and based on Wikipedia. It's used to test the model's ability to handle long contexts.

4. **IWSLT De-En**: A smaller dataset for machine translation from German to English, used to show the effectiveness of the Feedback Transformer on smaller scales.

5. **CNN-DailyMail**: A dataset for summarization tasks, where the model generates summaries from news articles. It's used to evaluate the model's summarization capabilities.

6. **Morris Water Maze**: A synthetic dataset used in reinforcement learning experiments to test the model's ability to navigate and remember locations.

Each of these datasets is described in the context of the experiments, providing details on their usage and relevance to the tasks addressed in the paper.
