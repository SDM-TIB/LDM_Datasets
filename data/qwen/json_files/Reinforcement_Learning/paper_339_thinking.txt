Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper introduces GVIN, a generalized value iteration network for planning on irregular graphs. It mentions experiments on synthetic 2D mazes, irregular graphs, and real-world maps like Minnesota highways and New York streets.

Looking into the Experimental Results section, the datasets used are:

1. **2D Mazes**: Synthetic 16x16 mazes generated using scripts from the VIN paper. These are used for training and testing GVIN's performance.

2. **Synthesized Irregular Graphs**: These are generated for testing GVIN's ability to handle irregular structures. The paper mentions 100-node graphs for training and testing.

3. **Minnesota Highway Map**: A real-world dataset with 2642 nodes and 6606 edges. It's used to evaluate GVIN's generalization on large-scale graphs.

4. **New York City Street Map**: Another real-world dataset with 5069 nodes and 13368 edges, used similarly to the Minnesota map.

I'll check the references for any additional datasets, but the paper doesn't cite external datasets beyond these. The authors don't mention any other datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the metadata fields:

- **Creators**: The authors of the paper are the creators since they generated or used these datasets for their experiments.
- **Description**: Based on how the datasets are described in the paper.
- **Title**: The name of each dataset as mentioned.
- **Issued**: The year the paper was published, 2018.
- **Language**: Not applicable as these are not text datasets.
- **Identifier**: No specific DOI or URL provided.
- **Theme**: Categories like Computer Science, Planning, etc.
- **Keywords**: Terms related to each dataset's use.
- **Landing Page**: Not provided.
- **Version**: Not mentioned.
- **Format**: Data format, like Graph Data.
- **Task**: The tasks for which the datasets were used, such as planning.

I'll ensure each dataset is accurately described based on the paper's content.
