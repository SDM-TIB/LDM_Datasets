Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "DISTRIBUTED PRIORITIZED EXPERIENCE REPLAY" by Dan Horgan and others. It discusses a distributed architecture for deep reinforcement learning, focusing on scaling up the generation and selection of experience data using prioritized experience replay.

Looking through the paper, I notice several mentions of environments and benchmarks used for evaluation. Specifically, the authors mention the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) and the DeepMind Control Suite.

1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: This is a popular benchmark for reinforcement learning, consisting of various Atari games. The paper uses ALE to evaluate their algorithm's performance.

2. **DeepMind Control Suite**: This is another benchmark for continuous control tasks, used to test the scalability and effectiveness of their approach.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors primarily focus on their architecture and its performance on these two established environments.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
