Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about stabilizing transformers for reinforcement learning, specifically introducing the Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL) architecture. 

First, I'll go through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned. The paper mentions several environments and benchmarks where the GTrXL was tested. 

1. **DMLab-30**: This is a multi-task benchmark suite developed by DeepMind. It consists of 30 different levels designed to test various aspects of learning and memory in agents. The paper mentions that GTrXL achieves state-of-the-art results on this benchmark.

2. **Numpad**: This is a continuous control task where an agent must activate a sequence of numbers on a pad. The paper uses this environment to demonstrate the scaling of the GTrXL's memory capabilities.

3. **Memory Maze**: Another environment where the agent must navigate a maze to find an apple, requiring the use of memory. The paper uses this to test the robustness and learning speed of the GTrXL.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors primarily focus on their architecture and its performance on these environments. 

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset as per the given vocabulary.

For DMLab-30:
- **Creator**: The authors of the paper are Emilio Parisotto, H. Francis Song, Jack W. Rae, Razvan Pascanu, Caglar Gulcehre, Siddhant M. Jayakumar, Max Jaderberg, RaphaÃ«l Lopez Kaufman, Aidan Clark, Seb Noury, Matthew M. Botvinick, Nicolas Heess, and Raia Hadsell. However, since DMLab-30 is a benchmark created by DeepMind, the creators would be the authors of the DMLab framework, which isn't explicitly mentioned here. So, I'll leave it as an empty list.
- **Description**: A multi-task benchmark suite with 30 levels testing learning and memory.
