Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Teaching a Machine to Read Maps with Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Gino Brunner and others. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets might be mentioned. The abstract mentions that the agent uses a 2D map to navigate a 3D environment, but it doesn't specify any datasets. 

Moving on to the introduction, the authors discuss the use of a 3D environment provided by DeepMind Lab. This is a clue that DeepMind Lab might be a dataset or environment used in the research. 

In the Related Work section, they reference several studies, including Mnih et al. (2015) and others, but these are more about methods than datasets. 

Looking at the Architecture section, they mention using the DeepMind Lab environment, which is a simulation platform for reinforcement learning. This suggests that DeepMind Lab is a key environment used in their work. 

In the Environment and Results section, they describe creating their own training and test sets of mazes with corresponding black and white maps in the DeepMind Lab environment. They mention training on mazes of sizes 5x5 up to 13x13 and testing on up to 21x21. 

So, the main dataset here is the set of mazes created within the DeepMind Lab environment. The authors didn't reference external datasets but built their own within this framework. 

I need to structure this into the required JSON format. The creator would be the authors of the paper since they created the dataset. The description would detail the mazes and their sizes. The title would be something like "DeepMind Lab Maze Dataset." The issued date isn't explicitly mentioned, but the paper was published in 2018. The language isn't applicable since it's a visual dataset. The identifier could be the URL to the DeepMind Lab environment. The theme would be robotics and navigation. Keywords include maze navigation, reinforcement learning, etc. The landing page is the DeepMind Lab URL. The format is image-based. The task is navigation.
