Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about improving deep reinforcement learning by combining DQN with Neural Episodic Control (NEC). The authors propose a method called NEC2DQN, which uses NEC for better sampling efficiency in the early stages of learning.

First, I'll go through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract and introduction don't mention specific datasets, but the methodology and experiments might. 

Looking at the sections, the authors mention using Pong from Atari 2600 provided with OpenAI Gym. That's a specific dataset or environment used for testing their algorithm. 

I should check if there are any other datasets mentioned. The references include various papers, but the only dataset explicitly used in the experiments is Pong from OpenAI Gym. 

So, the dataset to extract is Pong from Atari 2600. Now, I need to describe it using the given metadata vocabulary.

- **dcterms:creator**: The authors of the paper are the ones using the dataset, but the creators of the dataset are the developers of OpenAI Gym. However, since the paper doesn't specify the creators, I'll leave it as an empty list.
- **dcterms:description**: The Pong environment is a classic game where the goal is to hit a ball back and forth, with rewards based on scoring.
- **dcterms:title**: "Pong"
- **dcterms:issued**: The year when OpenAI Gym was released, which is 2016.
- **dcterms:language**: Not applicable as it's a game environment.
- **dcterms:identifier**: The URL to OpenAI Gym's documentation.
- **dcat:theme**: "Reinforcement Learning", "Game AI"
- **dcat:keyword**: "Pong", "Atari 2600", "Reinforcement Learning", "OpenAI Gym"
- **dcat:landingPage**: The URL to OpenAI Gym's official page.
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Not specified.
- **dcterms:format**: "Game Environment"
- **mls:task**: "Reinforcement Learning", "Game Playing"

I need to ensure all fields are correctly filled based on the information available. Since the creators aren't specified in the paper, I'll leave that field empty. The description should reflect how the dataset was used in the paper, which is for evaluating the learning speed of their algorithm.
