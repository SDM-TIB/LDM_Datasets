Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about a scalable trust-region method for deep reinforcement learning using Kronecker-factored approximation. The authors mention several environments and datasets they tested their method on.

First, I'll go through the paper to identify any datasets. In the introduction, they mention Atari games and MuJoCo environments. These are standard benchmarks in reinforcement learning.

Looking at the experiments section, they evaluated their method on six standard Atari games and several MuJoCo tasks. The Atari games include Beamrider, Breakout, Pong, Q-bert, Seaquest, and Space Invaders. The MuJoCo tasks include Ant, HalfCheetah, Hopper, InvertedPendulum, InvertedDoublePendulum, Reacher, Swimmer, and Walker2d.

I need to check if these are datasets or just environments. Atari games are part of the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), which is a dataset of video games. MuJoCo is a physics engine, but the tasks mentioned are standard benchmarks, not datasets per se.

So, the main dataset mentioned is the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) with the Atari games. The MuJoCo tasks are more about environments than datasets, so I won't include them as datasets.

Now, I'll structure the JSON response based on the metadata vocabulary provided. The creator would be the authors of the paper, but since the datasets are standard, I might need to reference their creators. However, the paper doesn't provide specific creators for the datasets, so I'll leave that as an empty list.

The description will be based on how the authors used the datasets. The title is the name of the dataset. The issued year isn't provided, so it'll be empty. Language isn't applicable, so it's empty. Identifier, landing page, version, format, and keywords are also not provided, so they'll be empty or as per the structure.

I'll include the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) with the Atari games as the dataset. The tasks are related to reinforcement learning, so I'll list that as the task.
