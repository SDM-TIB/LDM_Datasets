Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "BOOSTING NOISE ROBUSTNESS OF ACOUSTIC MODEL VIA DEEP ADVERSARIAL TRAINING" by Bin Liu and others. The abstract mentions using a dataset for experiments, but I need to look for specific names.

In the **5.1 Datasets** section, the authors mention:

- **CHiME-4 corpus**: This dataset is used for systematic evaluation. It includes real and simulated data, with training, development, and test sets.
- **WSJ0 set**: Used for generating simulated data by mixing clean speech with noisy backgrounds.

I'll check the references for more details on these datasets.

For **CHiME-4**, the citation is:
> Emmanuel Vincent, Shinji Watanabe, Aditya Arie Nugraha, Jon Barker, and Ricard Marxer. *An analysis of environment, microphone and data simulation mismatches in robust speech recognition*. Computer Speech and Language, 2016.

For **WSJ0**, it's a well-known dataset in speech research, often cited as:
> Daniel Povey, et al. *The Kaldi Speech Recognition Toolkit*. IEEE 2011 Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding, 2011.

Now, I'll compile the dataset entries into the required JSON format, ensuring all metadata fields are accurately filled based on the information from the paper.
