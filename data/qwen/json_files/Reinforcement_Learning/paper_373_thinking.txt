Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about TreeQN and ATreeC, which are differentiable tree-structured models for deep reinforcement learning. The authors mention several environments and datasets they used to evaluate their models.

First, I'll go through the paper section by section to identify any datasets. In the introduction, they talk about combining deep model-free reinforcement learning with online planning. They mention using environments where transition models are known a priori, but I don't see any specific datasets mentioned here.

Moving on to the background section, they discuss Markov Decision Processes and deep Q-learning. They reference OpenAI Baselines, which is a library of implementations for various reinforcement learning algorithms. OpenAI Baselines itself isn't a dataset, but it's worth noting as it's a tool used in their experiments.

In the experiments section, they evaluate their models on a box-pushing environment and a suite of Atari games. The box-pushing environment is described as a custom setup, so it's not a standard dataset. However, the Atari games are a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning. They specifically mention using the subset of nine Atari environments from Oh et al. (2017). 

Looking at the references, Oh et al. (2017) is cited, and their work involves Value Prediction Networks (VPNs) which use Atari games as a benchmark. The Atari dataset is a standard collection of video games used for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms, so this is a key dataset to note.

Additionally, the authors mention using OpenAI Baselines, which is a library that includes implementations for various RL algorithms, including those used in the Atari benchmark. While OpenAI Baselines isn't a dataset itself, it's a tool that uses datasets like the Atari games.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The box-pushing environment is custom, and the Atari games are the primary datasets used for evaluation. The authors also reference the work of Weber et al. (2017) but that's about a different approach and not a dataset.

So, the main dataset identified is the Atari games dataset, specifically the subset used by Oh et al. (2017). The OpenAI Baselines library is a tool used in their experiments but isn't a dataset.
