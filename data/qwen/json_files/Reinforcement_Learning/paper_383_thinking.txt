Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about an Intentional Unintentional (IU) agent that uses deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG) to solve multiple continuous control tasks simultaneously. The authors mention using a playroom environment built with the MuJoCo physics engine and a formal language to generate tasks.

First, I need to identify any datasets mentioned in the paper. The paper doesn't explicitly reference any datasets like ImageNet or MNIST. Instead, it describes the environment they created using MuJoCo. So, the main dataset here is the playroom environment they built for their experiments.

Next, I'll extract the metadata for this dataset. The creators are the authors of the paper: Serkan Cabi, Sergio G. Colmenarejo, Matthew W. Hoffman, Misha Denil, Ziyu Wang, and Nando de Freitas. The description should include that it's a virtual environment with objects and an agent that can interact with them. The title is "Playroom Environment." The issued year isn't explicitly stated, but the paper was published in 2017, so I'll use that. The language isn't applicable since it's a physics simulation. The identifier is the MuJoCo engine, which is a tool, not a dataset, so I'll leave it empty. The theme is robotics and reinforcement learning. Keywords include virtual environment, MuJoCo, and continuous control. The landing page is the MuJoCo website. The format is simulation data, and the task is continuous control.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned, so this is the only one to include.
