Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Energy-efficient Amortized Inference with Cascaded Deep Classifiers" by Jiaqi Guan and others. It discusses a novel framework for optimizing prediction accuracy and energy cost in deep neural networks, particularly for image classification tasks.

Looking through the abstract, I see that the experiments were conducted on several image classification datasets. The datasets mentioned are CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet32x32. 

Now, I'll go through each section to gather more details about these datasets.

In the introduction, the authors mention that their method is tested on image classification datasets, specifically CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. They describe these datasets as containing 32x32 RGB images.

In the "Datasets" section under the "Implementation and Experimental Setting," the authors provide more details:

- **CIFAR-10**: 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images with 10 classes.
- **CIFAR-100**: 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images with 100 classes.
- **ImageNet32x32**: A downsampled version of ImageNet, containing 1.2 million training images and 50,000 test images with 1000 classes.

The authors also mention that these datasets are used to benchmark their method, and they provide details about the structure of the ResNet models used for each dataset.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information gathered.

For **CIFAR-10**:
- **Creators**: The dataset was created by Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton.
- **Description**: A subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset, containing 60,000 32x32 color images divided into 10 classes.
- **Title**: CIFAR-10
- **Issued**: 2009
- **Theme**: Computer Vision, Image Classification
- **Keywords**: Image classification, 32x32 images, 10 classes
- **Task**: Image classification

For **CIFAR-100**:
- **Creators**: Same as CIFAR-10.
- **Description**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
- **Title**: CIFAR-100
- **Issued**: 2009
- **Theme**: Computer Vision, Image Classification
- **Keywords**: Image classification, 32x32 images, 100 classes
- **Task**: Image classification

For **ImageNet32x32**:
- **Creators**: The original ImageNet dataset was created by Fei-Fei Li, but the downsampled version is mentioned in the paper.
- **Description**: A downsampled version of ImageNet, containing 32x32 RGB images.
- **Title**: ImageNet32x32
- **Issued**: 2017 (as per the paper's reference)
- **Theme**: Computer Vision, Image Classification
- **Keywords**: Image classification, 32x32 images, 1000 classes
- **Task**: Image classification

I'll ensure that each dataset's metadata is accurately represented based on the information provided in the paper.
