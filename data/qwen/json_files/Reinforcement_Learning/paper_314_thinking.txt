Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper is about using reinforcement learning to develop a scheduling algorithm for data processing clusters. It mentions Decima, a system that uses RL to learn scheduling policies.

Looking through the sections, I find references to datasets used in evaluations. In the "Evaluation" section, they mention using an Alibaba production cluster trace. This is a real-world dataset used to simulate cluster workloads. They also reference TPC-H queries, which are standard benchmarks for database performance.

Another dataset mentioned is the Alibaba cluster data, which includes logs and traces from production clusters. This dataset is used to evaluate Decima's performance under real-world conditions.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors used these datasets to test and validate their scheduling algorithm in different scenarios, ensuring the effectiveness of Decima.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the metadata vocabulary provided.
