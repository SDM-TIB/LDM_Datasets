Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Shallow Updates for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Nir Levinea, Tom Zahavya, Daniel J. Mankowitz, Aviv Tamar, and Shie Mannor. It discusses a hybrid approach combining deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with shallow reinforcement learning (SRL) methods.

Looking through the sections, I find that the authors conducted experiments on the Atari 2600 games using the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). Specifically, they mention games like Breakout, Space Invaders, Asterix, Qbert, and Bowling. These are part of the Atari dataset, which is a standard benchmark in reinforcement learning.

The Atari dataset is widely used in RL research and is referenced in the paper's experiments. The authors used this dataset to evaluate their LS-DQN algorithm against DQN and DDQN agents.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The focus is on the Atari games within the ALE framework.
