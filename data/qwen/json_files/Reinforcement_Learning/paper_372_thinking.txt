Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract talks about spoken dialogue systems and using deep reinforcement learning, but doesn't mention specific datasets.

Moving to the introduction, the authors discuss the use of neural networks for policy optimization in dialogue systems. They reference several works, but I don't see any specific datasets mentioned here.

In the section on dialogue management, they mention the Cambridge Restaurants domain, which seems to be a specific dataset used for their experiments. This is likely one of the datasets.

Looking further, in the evaluation section, they mention the CamInfo domain, which is another dataset used for testing their algorithms. They also refer to the agenda-based user simulator, which might be a dataset or a simulation framework, but I'm not certain.

In the human evaluation section, they mention using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to gather data from volunteers interacting with their dialogue system. This could be considered a dataset, but it's more of a data collection method than a pre-existing dataset.

Additionally, they reference several other works in their literature review, but these are not datasets themselves. For example, they cite works on Gaussian processes and actor-critic methods, but these are methodologies, not datasets.

To summarize, the datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. Cambridge Restaurants domain
2. CamInfo domain
3. Agenda-based user simulator (possibly a dataset)
4. Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) data collection

However, upon closer inspection, the agenda-based user simulator is a simulation framework rather than a dataset, and AMT is a platform for data collection, not a pre-existing dataset. Therefore, the main datasets used are the Cambridge Restaurants domain and CamInfo domain.

I need to extract metadata for these datasets. The paper doesn't provide explicit details about the creators, descriptions, titles, etc., for these datasets, so I'll have to infer based on the context provided.

For the Cambridge Restaurants domain, it's likely a dataset used for training and testing dialogue systems, focusing on restaurant recommendations. The creators might be the authors of the paper or a research group associated with the University of Cambridge.

Similarly, the CamInfo domain is another dataset used for dialogue management, possibly focusing on information-seeking dialogues in a specific context.

Since the paper doesn't provide explicit metadata for these datasets, I'll have to leave some fields empty or infer based on the context.
