Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about sparse symmetric tensor regression for functional connectivity analysis, specifically applied to data from the Berkeley Aging Cohort Study (BACS). 

First, I'll go through the paper to identify any datasets. The abstract mentions the BACS, so that's one dataset. The introduction also refers to BACS, which is a study on Alzheimer's disease and normal aging. 

Looking further, the paper discusses the use of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data and Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography (PIB-PET) imaging. These are imaging techniques, but they don't necessarily refer to datasets unless they're part of a specific study or database. 

In the methods section, the authors mention using connectivity matrices derived from rs-fMRI data. They also refer to the Berkeley Aging Cohort Study (BACS) as their dataset. 

I don't see any other datasets mentioned. The paper doesn't reference external datasets beyond BACS. 

So, the only dataset identified is the Berkeley Aging Cohort Study (BACS). I'll structure the JSON accordingly, including the creator, description, title, and other relevant metadata based on the information provided in the paper.
