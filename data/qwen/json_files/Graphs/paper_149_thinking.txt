Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Graph Diffusion-Embedding Networks" by Bo Jiang, Doudou Lin, and Jin Tang. It discusses a novel graph diffusion-embedding networks (GDEN) for graph-structured data. The authors mention experiments on semi-supervised learning tasks using several benchmark datasets.

Looking through the sections, I find that in the "4 Experiments" section, the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention testing their model on citation network datasets, specifically Citeseer, Cora, and Pubmed. These datasets are commonly used in graph-based machine learning tasks, particularly for semi-supervised learning.

I should check if these datasets are cited in the references. Scanning the references, I see that the datasets are cited as [10], which refers to the paper by Sen et al. (2008). However, the specific datasets (Citeseer, Cora, Pubmed) are standard benchmarks and are widely recognized in the machine learning community. They are often cited together, so it's safe to assume they are the ones used here.

Now, I need to gather metadata for each dataset. The creators of these datasets are typically the authors who first introduced them. For example, the Cora dataset is often attributed to authors like McCallum, but in this case, the reference points to Sen et al. (2008), so I'll list them as creators.

The description for each dataset should reflect how they were used in the paper. Since they are citation networks, the description will mention that they are used for semi-supervised learning tasks.

The titles are straightforward: Citeseer, Cora, and Pubmed. The issued year can be taken from the reference, which is 2008. The language is English since these are standard datasets in English. There's no specific identifier like a DOI mentioned, so that field remains empty.

The themes are related to citation networks and graph-based learning. Keywords include citation networks, semi-supervised learning, and graph embedding. The landing page is also not provided, so it remains empty. The format is text since these datasets consist of text documents and their citations. The task is semi-supervised learning, as mentioned in the paper.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each dataset with the appropriate metadata fields. Since the paper mentions all three datasets, I'll create separate entries for each, ensuring consistency in the format.
