Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction. The paper discusses node classification in attributed graphs using active learning and mentions experiments on five public benchmark datasets. These datasets are likely standard ones used in graph-based machine learning.

In the methodology section, the authors reference several datasets, including Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed, Amazon-Photo, and Amazon-Computers. These are well-known datasets in the field of graph neural networks and node classification tasks.

Additionally, the paper mentions a private microwave link network dataset used for practical applications. This is a real-world dataset not publicly available, but it's still relevant as it's used in the experiments.

Now, I'll gather the details for each dataset:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset where nodes represent papers and edges represent citations. It's used for node classification tasks.
2. **CiteSeer**: Similar to Cora, it's another citation network dataset.
3. **PubMed**: A dataset of medical publications, often used for semi-supervised learning.
4. **Amazon-Photo**: A co-purchase dataset from Amazon, focusing on photo products.
5. **Amazon-Computers**: Another co-purchase dataset, this time for computer products.
6. **Microwave Link Network**: A private dataset used for identifying faulty links in a microwave network.

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata fields. Since the paper doesn't provide specific creators or identifiers for these datasets, I'll note them as empty where applicable. The themes and keywords will be based on the context provided in the paper.

Finally, I'll structure this information into a JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described according to the specified vocabulary.
