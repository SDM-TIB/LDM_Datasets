Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses contrastive learning for textual representations, mentioning methods like BERT and RoBERTa. These are models, not datasets, so I'll note that but move on.

In the "Related Work" section, I see references to NLP tasks and datasets. The GLUE benchmark is mentioned, which is a collection of datasets for natural language understanding. The paper also references the Penn Treebank (PTB) and Yelp corpora for text generation tasks. Additionally, image-text retrieval tasks are discussed using Flickr30K and MS-COCO datasets.

Looking at the "Experiments" section, the GLUE dataset is used extensively, with specific tasks like CoLA, SST-2, MRPC, MNLI, WNLI, STS-B, RTE, QQP, and QNLI. The paper also mentions the use of BERT and RoBERTa models, which are trained on large text corpora, but these are models, not datasets.

In the "VAE Results" section, the PTB and Yelp datasets are used for text generation. The "Image-Text Retrieval" experiments use Flickr30K and MS-COCO. The "VQA Test" mentions the VQA 2.0 dataset, which is built on COCO images.

Now, I'll compile the datasets identified:

1. GLUE Benchmark
2. Penn Treebank (PTB)
3. Yelp Corpora
4. Flickr30K
5. MS-COCO
6. VQA 2.0

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata. I'll check the references for creators, descriptions, and other details. If the paper doesn't provide specific details like creators or URLs, I'll leave those fields empty.

Finally, I'll structure the information into JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described according to the metadata vocabulary.
