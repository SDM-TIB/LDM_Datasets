Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction. The paper discusses predicting protein-ligand binding affinities using deep learning models. It mentions the PDBBind 2016 dataset, which seems to be a key dataset used in their experiments.

Moving to the materials and methods section, under the "Data" subsection, the paper elaborates on the PDBBind database. It's described as a curated subset of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and is used for developing machine learning-based scoring functions. The 2016 edition of PDBBind is specifically mentioned, consisting of 13,308 protein-ligand binding complexes.

The paper also mentions that docking poses are generated using the Vina scoring function, but Vina itself isn't a dataset; it's a tool. So, the main dataset here is PDBBind 2016.

I'll check if there are any other datasets mentioned elsewhere in the paper. The results and discussion sections refer back to PDBBind 2016, but no other datasets are cited. The references section doesn't list any additional datasets used in the study.

Therefore, the only dataset mentioned in the paper is PDBBind 2016. I'll extract its metadata based on the information provided in the paper.
