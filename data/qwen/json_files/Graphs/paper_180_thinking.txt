Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction. The abstract mentions "micro-expression recognition" and "Action Units (AUs)". It also refers to the CASME II dataset in the introduction. 

Looking further into the introduction, there's a mention of the CASME II dataset. The authors describe it as a spontaneous micro-expression dataset collected in a well-controlled lab environment. It contains 247 micro-expressions from 35 subjects, labeled based on AUs, self-reports, and stimuli content. The dataset has 7 classes with varying sample sizes, indicating class imbalance.

In the experiments section, the authors use the CASME II dataset for their evaluations. They mention two validation methods: leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) and k-folds cross-validation. The dataset's class distribution is discussed, highlighting the challenges due to class imbalance.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The focus is solely on CASME II for their experiments and results.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for CASME II based on the information extracted:

- **dcterms:creator**: The authors of the dataset are mentioned in the reference as Yan et al. (2014).
- **dcterms:description**: The dataset contains spontaneous micro-expressions collected in a lab, with 247 samples across 7 classes, labeled using AUs, self-reports, and stimuli.
- **dcterms:title**: CASME II
- **dcterms:issued**: 2014, as per the reference.
- **dcterms:language**: Not applicable, as it's a video dataset.
- **dcterms:identifier**: The DOI from the reference is 10.1371/journal.pone.0086041.
- **dcat:theme**: Computer Vision, Facial Expression Recognition.
- **dcat:keyword**: Micro-expression, Facial Action Units, Spontaneous Expressions.
- **dcat:landingPage**: The URL from the reference is https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0086041.
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Not mentioned, so empty.
- **dcterms:format**: Video.
- **mls:task**: Micro-expression recognition, Facial expression analysis.

I'll ensure all fields are correctly filled based on the information provided in the paper.
