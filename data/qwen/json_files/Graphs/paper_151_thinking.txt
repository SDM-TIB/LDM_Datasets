Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about pulmonary nodule detection using deep convolutional neural networks. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets are being used. The abstract mentions the LUng Nodule Analysis 2016 (LUNA16) Challenge, which is a dataset used for evaluating their approach. 

Looking further into the introduction, the authors reference the LIDC-IDRI database as the largest publicly available reference database for pulmonary nodules. This is another dataset they used. 

In the methodology section, they describe their experiments on the LUNA16 Challenge dataset, which was collected from the LIDC-IDRI database. They mention that the dataset contains 1018 CT scans, with 888 scans used after exclusions. 

The results section also refers to the LUNA16 Challenge, where their system achieved the highest performance. 

I need to check the references for more details. The LUNA16 Challenge is cited in reference [7], which is a paper by Setio et al. from 2016. The LIDC-IDRI is cited in reference [2], authored by Armato et al. in 2011.

So, the two datasets mentioned are LUNA16 and LIDC-IDRI. I'll extract their metadata based on the information provided in the paper and their references.
