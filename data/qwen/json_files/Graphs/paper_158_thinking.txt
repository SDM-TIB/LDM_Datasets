Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses Differentiable Graph Module (DGM) for Graph Convolutional Networks, mentioning applications in healthcare, brain imaging, computer graphics, and computer vision. It references several datasets in the experiments section.

Looking at the experiments section, I see the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed**: These are citation graph datasets used for benchmarking. They are mentioned in Table 1 and discussed in Section 5.1.

2. **Tadpole**: A medical dataset for disease prediction, described in Section 5.2.

3. **UK Biobank**: Another medical dataset for age prediction, also discussed in Section 5.2.

4. **ShapeNet**: A 3D point cloud dataset used for segmentation tasks, mentioned in Section 5.3.

5. **ImageNet 2012**: A large dataset for zero-shot learning, referenced in Section 5.3.

6. **AWA2 (Animals with Attributes 2)**: Used for zero-shot learning evaluation, mentioned in Section 5.3.

Now, I'll extract metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.

For **Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed**:
- Creators: The authors of the datasets are not explicitly mentioned in the paper, but they are standard benchmarks.
- Description: Citation graphs used for node classification.
- Title: Each dataset's name.
- Issued: The year they were introduced, which I'll assume based on common knowledge.
- Theme: Machine learning, graph analysis.
- Keywords: Citation network, node classification.
- Landing page: URLs where the datasets are hosted.
- Format: Graph data.

For **Tadpole**:
- Creators: The authors of the Tadpole challenge.
- Description: Multimodal data for disease prediction.
- Theme: Healthcare, medical imaging.
- Keywords: Disease prediction, multimodal data.

For **UK Biobank**:
- Creators: The UK Biobank team.
- Description: Multimodal data for age prediction.
- Theme: Healthcare, medical imaging.
- Keywords: Age prediction, multimodal data.

For **ShapeNet**:
- Creators: The authors of the ShapeNet dataset.
- Description: 3D point clouds for segmentation.
- Theme: Computer graphics, 3D segmentation.
- Keywords: Point cloud, segmentation.

For **ImageNet 2012**:
- Creators: The ImageNet team.
- Description: Large-scale image dataset.
- Theme: Computer vision.
- Keywords: Image classification, zero-shot learning.

For **AWA2**:
- Creators: The authors of the AWA2 dataset.
- Description: Dataset for zero-shot learning.
- Theme: Computer vision.
- Keywords: Zero-shot learning, attribute-based classification.

I'll structure each dataset's metadata accordingly, ensuring all fields are filled based on the information available in the paper.
