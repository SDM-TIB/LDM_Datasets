Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses link prediction in knowledge graphs using a GCN framework called TransGCN. It mentions experiments on two datasets: FB15K-237 and WN18RR. These are likely the main datasets used.

Next, I'll check the sections where datasets are typically described, such as the "Datasets" or "Experiments" sections. In the paper, under Section 3.1, it details the datasets FB15K-237 and WN18RR. These are filtered versions of Freebase and WordNet datasets, respectively, used to evaluate link prediction models.

I'll note the creators of these datasets. FB15K-237 is derived from Freebase, created by Metaweb Technologies. WN18RR is based on WordNet, developed by Princeton University. However, the specific creators of the filtered versions might not be explicitly mentioned, so I'll attribute them to the original creators.

The descriptions of the datasets are provided in the paper. FB15K-237 has 14,541 entities, 237 relations, and around 272k training triples. WN18RR has 40,943 entities, 118 relations, and about 6,835 training triples. These are used for link prediction tasks.

The titles are straightforward: FB15K-237 and WN18RR. The issued years aren't explicitly stated in the paper, but I know Freebase was launched in 2007 and WordNet in 1993. The languages are English, as these are standard datasets in English.

The identifiers are the dataset names themselves, as no DOIs or URLs are provided. The themes are "Knowledge Graphs" and "Link Prediction." The keywords include "Knowledge Graph," "Link Prediction," "Entity," and "Relation."

The landing pages aren't provided, so they'll be empty. The formats are "Structured Data" as they're relational datasets. The tasks are "Link Prediction."

I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described with the appropriate metadata.
