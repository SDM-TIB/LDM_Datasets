Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses Hebbian semi-supervised learning in a sample efficiency setting and mentions experiments on various object recognition datasets.

In the introduction, the authors reference CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets. These are standard datasets used in computer vision tasks.

Moving to the experimental setup section, the authors detail their experiments on these datasets. CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 are from the CIFAR dataset collection, while Tiny ImageNet is a subset of the ImageNet dataset.

I'll need to gather metadata for each dataset. For each, I'll extract the creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, themes, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 were created by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E. Hinton. They are image datasets with 10 and 100 classes, respectively. Published in 2009, they're used for object recognition tasks.

Tiny ImageNet, created by Stanford University, is a subset of ImageNet with 200 classes. Published in 2015, it's also used for image classification.

I'll structure each dataset's metadata according to the specified vocabulary, ensuring all fields are filled accurately based on the information from the paper.
