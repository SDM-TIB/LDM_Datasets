Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe them using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction sections. The abstract mentions datasets like PASCAL VOC, MSCOCO, Visual Genome (VG), and BDD. These are likely the main datasets used in the study.

Next, I'll go through the introduction and related work sections to find more references. The paper discusses object detection tasks and mentions several datasets:

1. **PASCAL VOC**: This is a well-known dataset for object detection with 20 categories.
2. **MSCOCO**: A large-scale dataset with 80 categories, often used for object detection and segmentation.
3. **Visual Genome (VG)**: A dataset with over 33,000 categories, used for more comprehensive object detection.
4. **BDD**: The Berkeley Deep Drive dataset, which has 10 categories and is used for autonomous vehicle research.

I'll also check the experiments section to see if any additional datasets are mentioned. The paper evaluates its method on MSCOCO, VG, and ADE (another dataset with 445 classes for segmentation). 

Now, I'll gather the metadata for each dataset:

- **PASCAL VOC**: Created by Everingham et al., published in 2010, contains images with 20 object categories.
- **MSCOCO**: Created by Lin et al., published in 2014, includes 80 categories with images and annotations.
- **Visual Genome**: Created by Krishna et al., published in 2016, has over 33,000 categories with detailed annotations.
- **BDD**: Created by Yu et al., published in 2018, focuses on autonomous driving with 10 categories.
- **ADE**: Created by Zhou et al., published in 2017, used for segmentation tasks with 445 classes.

I'll structure each dataset's metadata according to the specified vocabulary, ensuring all fields are filled where information is available. If some fields aren't mentioned, I'll leave them empty.
