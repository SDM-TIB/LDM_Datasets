Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper introduces Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNN) and mentions experiments on citation networks and visual object recognition tasks. 

Looking into the experiments section, I see two main datasets used for citation network classification: Cora and PubMed. Both are standard datasets in graph-based learning. 

For visual object recognition, the paper uses ModelNet40 and NTU datasets. ModelNet40 is a large dataset of 3D objects, while NTU is another 3D shape dataset. 

I'll check the references to find more details about each dataset. 

- **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2708 nodes and 5429 edges. It's used for node classification tasks.
- **PubMed**: Another citation network dataset with 19717 nodes and 44336 edges, also used for node classification.
- **ModelNet40**: Contains 12,311 3D objects from 40 categories, used for shape recognition.
- **NTU**: Comprises 2012 3D shapes from 67 categories, used for 3D object classification.

Each dataset's metadata will be extracted based on the information provided in the paper and its references.
