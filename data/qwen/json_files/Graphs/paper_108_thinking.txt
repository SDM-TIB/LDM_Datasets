Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses session-aware recommendation systems and mentions two real-world datasets: Xing and Reddit. 

Next, I'll check the sections where datasets are described. In the "4.1 Data Sets" section, the authors detail the Xing and Reddit datasets. Xing is from the RecSys Challenge 2016, and Reddit is extracted from a Kaggle dataset. 

I need to gather metadata for each dataset. For Xing, the creators are listed as the authors of the RecSys Challenge paper. The description includes user interactions on job postings. The title is "Xing Dataset," and it was issued in 2016. The landing page is the RecSys Challenge website. 

For Reddit, the creators are the authors of the Kaggle dataset. The description involves user interactions on subreddits. The title is "Reddit Dataset," issued in 2016, with a landing page on Kaggle.

I'll structure this information into JSON format, ensuring each dataset includes all required metadata fields. I'll make sure to only include datasets mentioned in the paper and avoid any additional information.
