Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Path-Augmented Graph Transformer Network" by Benson Chen, Regina Barzilay, and Tommi Jaakkola. It discusses a new model called PAGTN and compares it against GCN models on various molecular property prediction tasks.

In the abstract, the authors mention datasets such as QM7, QM8, QM9, ESOL, Lipophilicity, BACE, and BBBP. These are all benchmark datasets used for molecular property prediction.

Looking into the introduction, the authors elaborate on these datasets, explaining that they cover different areas: quantum chemistry (QM7, QM8, QM9), physical chemistry (ESOL, Lipophilicity), and biochemistry (BACE, BBBP). They reference Wu et al., 2018, as the source for these datasets.

In the experiments section, the authors detail their setup, confirming that they tested their model on these seven datasets. They mention that each dataset focuses on a different molecular property, making their composition highly variable.

I need to extract metadata for each of these datasets. However, the paper doesn't provide detailed descriptions or URLs for each dataset. The references section mentions Wu et al., 2018, as the source, but without specific DOIs or URLs for each dataset.

Given the information available, I can list the datasets with their titles, descriptions based on their usage in the paper, and note that the creators are from Wu et al., 2018. The issued year is 2018, as that's when the datasets were referenced. The themes are related to molecular property prediction, and the tasks involve property prediction.

I'll structure each dataset with the available metadata, noting that some fields like identifiers, landing pages, and versions are not provided in the paper.
