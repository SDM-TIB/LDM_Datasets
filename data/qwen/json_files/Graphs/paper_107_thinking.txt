Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses Stochastic Shared Embeddings (SSE) and its application in various tasks. It mentions experiments conducted on six distinct tasks, including recommender systems, neural machine translation, and BERT pre-training and fine-tuning.

Looking into the experiments section, I find references to several datasets:

1. **Movielens1m and Movielens10m**: These are recommendation datasets used in the experiments. They are mentioned in the context of matrix factorization and BPR algorithms.

2. **Douban**: Another recommendation dataset used alongside Movielens10m and Netiix.

3. **Yahoo Music**: Used in the BPR experiments for implicit feedback.

4. **Foursquare**: Another dataset for implicit feedback recommendations.

5. **WMT 2014 English-German**: A neural machine translation dataset used in the transformer experiments.

6. **IMDB movie reviews**: Used for pre-training BERT and sentiment classification.

7. **SST-2**: The Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset used for sentiment classification.

8. **News-test sets from 2008 to 2018**: These are part of the WMT evaluation for translation tasks.

Now, I'll gather metadata for each dataset. For each, I'll determine the creator, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For example, Movielens datasets are created by GroupLens Research, used for recommendation tasks, and have specific years and themes. Similarly, IMDB and SST-2 have their own creators and uses.

I'll structure each dataset into the required JSON format, ensuring all fields are filled based on the information available in the paper. If some details aren't explicitly mentioned, I'll leave those fields empty.

Finally, I'll compile all the datasets into a JSON array, making sure each entry is correctly formatted and all necessary metadata is included.
