Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions STL10 and MS-COCO datasets. STL10 is a subset of ImageNet designed for unsupervised learning, and MS-COCO is a large-scale dataset for object detection and image segmentation.

Moving to the introduction, the authors discuss self-supervised visual representation learning and mention STL10 and MS-COCO again. They also reference ImageNet, which is a well-known dataset for image classification.

In the methodology section, they don't introduce any new datasets but continue to use STL10 and MS-COCO for their experiments. The experiments section provides more details about how these datasets are used, such as STL10 being used for linear classification tasks and MS-COCO for evaluating performance on cluttered scenes.

Looking at the references, I find citations for STL10, MS-COCO, and ImageNet. These are the primary datasets used in the paper.

Now, I'll extract the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper and the references.

For STL10:
- Creator: The authors of STL10, which are Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee.
- Description: A subset of ImageNet with 100k unlabeled images and labeled splits for training and testing.
- Title: STL-10
- Issued: 2011
- Theme: Computer Vision, Unsupervised Learning
- Keywords: Image classification, Unsupervised learning, Feature learning
- Landing Page: The URL from the reference.
- Format: Image
- Task: Feature learning, Image classification

For MS-COCO:
- Creator: Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, and others.
- Description: A dataset with common objects in context, including images and annotations.
- Title: MS-COCO
- Issued: 2014
- Theme: Computer Vision, Object Detection
- Keywords: Object detection, Image segmentation, Scene understanding
- Landing Page: The URL from the reference.
- Format: Image
- Task: Object detection, Image segmentation

For ImageNet:
- Creator: Jia Deng, Wei Dong, and others.
- Description: A large visual database organized into categories.
- Title: ImageNet
- Issued: 2009
- Theme: Computer Vision, Image Classification
- Keywords: Image classification, Large-scale dataset
- Landing Page: The URL from the reference.
- Format: Image
- Task: Image classification, Object recognition

I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described with the appropriate metadata fields.
