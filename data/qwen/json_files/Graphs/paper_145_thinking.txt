Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses a context-aware short-term interest first model for session-based recommendation. It mentions experiments on two real-world datasets: Yoochoose and Diginetica.

Next, I'll check the sections where datasets are described. In the "4.1.1. Datasets" section, the authors detail the datasets they used. Yoochoose is from the RecSys Challenge 2015, and Diginetica is from the CIKM Cup 2016. They describe preprocessing steps and provide statistics for each dataset.

I'll also look for any references or citations related to these datasets. The authors reference their preprocessing methods based on previous works, but the datasets themselves are clearly named and described.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset using the specified vocabulary. For each dataset, I'll extract the creator, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

Since the datasets are real-world and used for recommendation tasks, the themes and keywords will reflect that context. The creators are the organizations that provided the datasets, as the authors of the paper are not the creators.

I'll ensure that each field is filled accurately based on the information provided in the paper. If any information isn't available, I'll leave it as an empty string or list.

Finally, I'll compile the JSON response with the extracted metadata for both Yoochoose and Diginetica datasets.
