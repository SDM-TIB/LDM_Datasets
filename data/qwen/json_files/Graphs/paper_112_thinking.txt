Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about a model called StAR (Structure-Augmented Text Representation) for knowledge graph completion. It mentions several datasets used in their experiments.

First, I'll go through the paper to identify any datasets. I see references to WN18RR, FB15k-237, UMLS, and NELL-One. These are all knowledge graph datasets used for link prediction tasks.

For each dataset, I need to extract the metadata as per the given vocabulary. Let's start with WN18RR. It's derived from WordNet, a large lexical database. The creators are George Miller and others, but the specific version used here is WN18RR, which was updated by Dettmers et al. in 2018. The description mentions it's a subset of WordNet for link prediction, with 40,943 entities and 3,134 relations.

Next is FB15k-237, a subset of Freebase. The creators include Bollacker et al. from 2008, but the specific version used here is FB15k-237, updated by Toutanova et al. in 2015. It has 14,541 entities and 1,356 relations.

UMLS is a medical knowledge graph. The creators are from the National Library of Medicine, and it's used for medical link prediction. The dataset has 135 entities and 189 relations.

Lastly, NELL-One is derived from the NELL project by Carlson et al. in 2010. It's a zero-shot dataset with 8,545 entities and 1,472 relations.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata, ensuring all fields are filled based on the information provided in the paper.
