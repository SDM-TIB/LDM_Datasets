Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Constant Curvature Graph Convolutional Networks" by Gregor Bachmann, Gary Becigneul, and Octavian-Eugen Ganea. It's about extending graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to work with non-Euclidean geometries, specifically hyperbolic and spherical spaces.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method outperforms Euclidean GCNs on tasks like node classification and distortion minimization for symbolic data with non-Euclidean behavior. It doesn't specify the datasets used, though.

Moving to the introduction, the authors discuss the limitations of Euclidean geometry in representing certain types of data, such as hierarchical or cyclic data. They mention that hyperbolic and spherical spaces are better suited for these tasks. However, no specific datasets are cited here.

In the sections discussing experiments, the authors evaluate their models on synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. The synthetic datasets include a tree, a torus, and a spherical graph. For real datasets, they mention Citeseer, Cora, PubMed, and an airport dataset. These are standard datasets used in graph-based machine learning tasks.

Looking at the references, the authors cite several works that might have datasets, but the datasets themselves aren't explicitly listed in the paper. The datasets used are likely standard ones commonly used in the field, such as Citeseer, Cora, and PubMed, which are citation networks, and the airport dataset, which is a transportation network.

I need to structure the JSON response with the metadata for each dataset. For each dataset, I'll include the creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, themes, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

Since the paper doesn't provide explicit references for these datasets, I'll assume the creators are the authors of the original datasets. For example, Cora is a well-known dataset, and its creators are typically cited in the literature. Similarly, Citeseer and PubMed are standard datasets in the field.

I'll structure each dataset entry with the appropriate metadata based on the information provided in the paper and common knowledge about these datasets.
