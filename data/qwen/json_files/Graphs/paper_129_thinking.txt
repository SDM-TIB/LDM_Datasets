Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "SPATIO-TEMPORAL CROP CLASSIFICATION ON VOLUMETRIC DATA" by Muhammad Usman Qadeer, Salar Saeed, Murtaza Taj, and Abubakr Muhammad. The abstract mentions using benchmark datasets like Yolo and Imperial county datasets. 

Looking into the introduction, the authors reference Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite imagery. These are datasets used for crop classification. 

In the methodology section, under data preprocessing, they mention using Google Earth Engine Platform for processing Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images. They also reference the California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) for crop survey data in Imperial and Yolo counties.

In the results section, they evaluate their model on Imperial and Yolo county datasets provided by CDWR. These datasets are used for both pixel-wise and parcel-wise analysis.

In the references, I found that the datasets are cited as follows:
- Imperial County and Yolo County datasets are provided by CDWR.
- Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 are satellite datasets.

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields.
