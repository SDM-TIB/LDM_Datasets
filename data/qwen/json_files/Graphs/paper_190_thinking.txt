Alright, I'm trying to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper introduces GraphCGAN, a framework combining GANs with convolutional graph neural networks for semi-supervised learning. It mentions benchmark datasets used in experiments.

Looking at the sections, the "EXPERIMENTS" section details the datasets. It lists three standard citation network datasets: Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed. These are commonly used in graph-based semi-supervised learning tasks.

I need to gather metadata for each dataset. The creators are the authors who originally published these datasets. For Cora and Citeseer, the creators are Sen et al., and for Pubmed, it's the same group. The description should reflect how the paper uses these datasets, focusing on their role in evaluating the model's performance.

The titles are straightforward: Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed. The issued year is 2008, as referenced in the paper. The language isn't specified, so it remains empty. Identifiers like DOIs aren't provided, so those fields are empty.

The themes are related to machine learning and graph-based tasks. Keywords include semi-supervised learning, citation networks, and graph neural networks. Landing pages aren't provided, so they're empty. Versions aren't mentioned, so that's empty too. The format is relational data, and the tasks involve node classification.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring accuracy based on the paper's description.
