Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about a Bayesian Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for traffic forecasting. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets are used. The abstract mentions that the method is verified on two real-world datasets. 

Looking further into the paper, under the "Experiments" section, it specifically mentions two datasets: SZ-taxi and Los-loop. 

- **SZ-taxi**: This dataset records traffic speed on 156 major roads in Luohu District, Shen Zhen from January 1 to January 31, 2015. The data is aggregated every 15 minutes.
- **Los-loop**: This dataset collects traffic speed on 207 highways in Los Angeles County from March 1 to March 7, 2012. The data is aggregated every 5 minutes.

Both datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The paper doesn't provide specific creators for these datasets, only that they are real-world datasets. 

I'll structure the JSON response with the metadata for each dataset as described.
