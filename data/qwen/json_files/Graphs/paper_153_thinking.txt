Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses hypergraph convolution and attention in graph neural networks. It mentions experiments on citation networks and text categorization.

Looking at the experiments section, I see they used Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, and a modified 20-newsgroup dataset. Each of these is a dataset used for node classification tasks.

For each dataset, I need to extract the metadata. The creators are the authors of the datasets, but since the paper doesn't provide specific creators, I'll note that as empty. The descriptions are based on how the paper uses them. The titles are the dataset names. The issued year isn't provided, so it's empty. Language is English for text datasets. Identifiers and landing pages aren't provided, so they're empty. Themes are related to the tasks, keywords describe the datasets, and tasks are the uses mentioned.

I'll structure each dataset with the required fields, ensuring accuracy based on the paper's description.
