Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses active contrastive learning for audio-visual video representations. It mentions datasets like UCF101, HMDB51, and ESC50 as benchmarks for downstream tasks. These are likely the main datasets used.

Next, I'll look into the experiments section to find more details. The paper pretrains on Kinetics-700 and AudioSet. Kinetics-700 is a large-scale video dataset, and AudioSet is a dataset of environmental sounds. These are crucial for their self-supervised learning approach.

I also notice references to other datasets like Kinetics-Sound, which is a subset of Kinetics focused on audio-visual correspondence. Additionally, the paper mentions ESC50, which is used for audio event classification.

I should ensure I capture all these datasets and their relevant details. For each dataset, I'll extract the creator, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the specified JSON format, ensuring all fields are filled accurately based on the information provided in the paper.
