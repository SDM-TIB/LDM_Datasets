Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Risk Management via Anomaly Circumvent: Mnemonic Deep Learning for Midterm Stock Prediction" by Xinyi Li, Yinchuan Li, Xiao-Yang Liu, and Christina Dan Wang. The abstract mentions using S&P 500 stocks for experiments. 

Looking through the sections, the authors describe their experiments using S&P 500 component stocks. They downloaded data from Yahoo Finance, covering a period from 2009 to 2018. The dataset includes 451 stocks with records of close prices and trading volumes over 2,800 trading days.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors only reference their own data collection from Yahoo Finance for the S&P 500 stocks. There are no other datasets cited or used in their analysis.

So, the only dataset identified is the S&P 500 stocks dataset from Yahoo Finance.
