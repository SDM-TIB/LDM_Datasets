Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about a reinforcement learning approach for various vehicle routing problems, specifically using graph-centric representation learning. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract and introduction don't mention specific datasets, but they do refer to libraries like TSPLib, mTSPLib, and CVRPLib. These are standard libraries used for vehicle routing problems, so they might be considered datasets in this context.

Looking further into the paper, the authors mention using random instances for their experiments but don't reference any specific external datasets. However, they do compare their results with benchmark problems from these libraries. 

So, the datasets I can identify are:
1. TSPLib (Traveling Salesman Problem Library)
2. mTSPLib (Multi-Traveling Salesman Problem Library)
3. CVRPLib (Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem Library)

Each of these libraries provides standard benchmark instances for vehicle routing problems, which the authors used to validate their model's performance.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper and the libraries' descriptions.
