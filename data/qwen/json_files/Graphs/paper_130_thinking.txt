Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses Sequence Contrastive Learning (SeCo) for unsupervised representation learning in videos. It mentions several datasets in the experiments section.

Looking at the experiments section, the datasets used are:

1. **Kinetics400**: A large-scale action recognition benchmark with around 300K videos from 400 action categories. It's split into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **UCF101**: A popular action recognition dataset with 13,320 videos from 101 action classes, split into training and testing sets.

3. **HMDB51**: Another widely used action recognition dataset with 7K videos from 51 action categories, split into training and testing sets.

4. **ActivityNet**: A large-scale human activity understanding benchmark with 19,994 videos from 200 activity categories, split into training, validation, and test sets.

5. **OTB-100**: An object tracking benchmark with 100 video sequences used for evaluation.

6. **GOT-10K**: A generic object tracking benchmark with over 10K videos and 1.5M manually labeled bounding boxes.

Now, I'll gather the metadata for each dataset as per the vocabulary:

- **dcterms:creator**: The authors of the dataset as mentioned in the paper's references.
- **dcterms:description**: A brief description based on how the paper uses or describes the dataset.
- **dcterms:title**: The name of the dataset.
- **dcterms:issued**: The year the dataset was published.
- **dcterms:language**: Not applicable for these datasets as they are video datasets.
- **dcterms:identifier**: DOI or URL if available.
- **dcat:theme**: Thematic categories like action recognition, object tracking.
- **dcat:keyword**: Relevant keywords.
- **dcat:landingPage**: URL if available.
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Specific version if mentioned.
- **dcterms:format**: Video.
- **mls:task**: Tasks like action recognition, object tracking.

I'll structure each dataset into a JSON object with these fields, ensuring accuracy based on the paper's descriptions.
