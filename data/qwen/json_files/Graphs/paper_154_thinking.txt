Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses using graph neural networks (GNNs) for El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecasting. It mentions datasets like SODA, CMIP5, and GODAS. 

Looking into the Methods section, the authors detail their setup. They use the SODA reanalysis dataset (1871-1973) and climate model simulations from CMIP5. The GODAS dataset (1984-2017) is used as the test set. These datasets are crucial for training and validating their model.

In the Results section, they reference the SINTEX-F model, which is another dataset used for comparison. Additionally, they mention the NOAA dataset for observations, which is used to validate their predictions.

I'll also check the references for any other datasets. The references include works that might have datasets, but from the provided text, the main datasets are SODA, CMIP5, GODAS, SINTEX-F, and NOAA.

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields. For each dataset, I'll note the creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, themes, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For SODA, the creators are the developers of the SODA reanalysis. The description includes its use for training. The title is straightforward, and the year is 1998. Themes are climate and oceanography, keywords include reanalysis and SST, and the format is gridded data.

CMIP5 is a climate model dataset, used for simulations. Its creators are the CMIP5 team, and it's used for training the model. Themes are climate modeling, keywords include CMIP and climate models, and the format is model output.

GODAS is used for testing, focusing on SST and heat content. Themes are climate and oceanography, keywords include GODAS and SST, and the format is gridded data.

SINTEX-F is a dynamical model dataset used for comparison. Themes are climate modeling, keywords include SINTEX and dynamical models, and the format is model output.

NOAA provides observational data for validation. Themes are climate and oceanography, keywords include NOAA and observations, and the format is gridded data.

I'll ensure each dataset is accurately described based on the paper's usage and the provided references.
