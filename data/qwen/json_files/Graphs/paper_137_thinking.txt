Alright, I'm trying to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about benchmarking graph neural networks on link prediction tasks. Let me go through the paper step by step to identify the datasets.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions benchmarking GNN models on different datasets for link prediction. The datasets include Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed, and Wiki-CS. These are all citation networks except Wiki-CS, which is based on Wikipedia.

Next, I'll check the introduction. It briefly mentions the use of citation networks but doesn't add new datasets. The datasets are more clearly listed in Section 2, which is dedicated to datasets. Here, each dataset is described in detail.

Cora is a citation network with 2708 nodes and 5429 edges. Each node has a bag-of-words vector. CiteSeer is similar but has 3327 nodes and 4732 edges. PubMed is another citation network with 19717 nodes and 44338 edges, using TF/IDF vectors. Wiki-CS is based on Wikipedia articles with 11701 nodes and 216213 edges, using GloVe embeddings.

I'll also check the references to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned. The references include links to PyTorch Geometric and other resources, but no new datasets are introduced beyond the four already listed.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the metadata vocabulary. For each dataset, I'll extract the creator, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed, the creators are the authors from the references, which are the same as the paper's authors. Wiki-CS's creator is the same as the paper's authors since it's a newly published dataset in the same domain.

The descriptions are based on how the paper describes each dataset. The titles are straightforward. The issued year is extracted from the references. Since these are citation networks, the language is English. Identifiers are URLs from PyTorch Geometric. Themes include citation networks and Wikipedia. Keywords are based on the dataset's content. Landing pages are the URLs where the datasets can be accessed. Formats are all text-based. Tasks include link prediction.

I need to ensure that each field is correctly filled based on the information provided in the paper. If any information is missing, I'll leave that field empty. For example, the landing page for Wiki-CS isn't provided, so it remains empty.

Finally, I'll compile all this information into the required JSON format, making sure each dataset is accurately represented with all the necessary metadata.
