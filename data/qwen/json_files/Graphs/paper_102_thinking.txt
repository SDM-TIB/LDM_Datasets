Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract to get an overview. It mentions "free-hand sketches" and "Google QuickDraw." So, Google QuickDraw is definitely a dataset used here.

Moving to the introduction, the authors discuss various applications of sketches, but no new datasets are mentioned. They reference some studies, but those are not datasets.

In the methodology section, they describe their approach using graphs and transformers. They mention using Google QuickDraw again, confirming its use. There's no other dataset mentioned here.

Looking at the experiments section, they detail their setup. They use Google QuickDraw, which they sampled to create training, validation, and test sets. They also mention other datasets like TU-Berlin and QuickDraw, but TU-Berlin isn't a separate dataset in this contextâ€”it's just another name for QuickDraw.

In the results section, they compare their model with others using the same dataset, Google QuickDraw. No new datasets are introduced here.

Finally, in the references, they cite various works, but none introduce new datasets beyond what's already mentioned.

So, the only dataset explicitly mentioned and used in this paper is Google QuickDraw.
