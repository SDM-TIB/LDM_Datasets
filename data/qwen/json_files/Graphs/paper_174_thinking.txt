Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions the introduction of a new method for face verification across large age gaps and the creation of a new dataset called the Large Age-Gap (LAG) dataset. So, that's one dataset.

Next, I'll go through the introduction and related work sections. The paper discusses existing datasets in the field of face recognition and verification. It mentions several datasets:

1. **LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)**: This is a well-known dataset for unconstrained face recognition.
2. **Pubig**: Another dataset used for face recognition with a larger number of images per identity.
3. **CasiaWebFace**: A large-scale dataset for face recognition.
4. **FGNet**: A dataset focused on face aging and recognition across age gaps.
5. **MORPH**: A dataset used for age estimation and face recognition.
6. **CACD**: A dataset created by crawling celebrity images for cross-age face recognition.
7. **CAFE**: A dataset specifically designed for cross-age face verification.

The paper also describes the newly introduced **LAG dataset**, which is the primary focus of their research.

Now, I'll check the references section to find more details about each dataset, such as their creators, publication years, and any available URLs or DOIs. However, the provided paper doesn't include the full references, so I'll rely on the information given in the paper itself.

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata fields based on the information provided in the paper. If specific details like the creator's name or publication year aren't mentioned, I'll leave those fields empty.

Finally, I'll compile all the identified datasets into a JSON format, ensuring each dataset is described accurately according to the metadata vocabulary provided.
