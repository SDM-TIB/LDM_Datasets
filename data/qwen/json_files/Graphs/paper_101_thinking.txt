Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Cognitive Graph for Multi-Hop Reading Comprehension at Scale" by Ming Ding and others. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to understand the context. The paper introduces a framework called CogQA for multi-hop question answering, which uses a cognitive graph to model the reasoning process. They mention using the HotpotQA dataset, which is a well-known dataset for multi-hop QA tasks.

Looking further into the paper, the authors detail their experiments and the datasets they used. They specifically mention the HotpotQA dataset in the introduction and later sections. The HotpotQA dataset is split into training, development, and test sets, with a focus on multi-hop reasoning questions.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors don't reference any additional datasets beyond HotpotQA for their experiments and evaluations. 

So, the only dataset identified in this paper is HotpotQA. I'll gather the necessary metadata for this dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
