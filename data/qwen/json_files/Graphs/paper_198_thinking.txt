Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The abstract mentions experiments on multiple benchmark datasets for node and graph classification tasks. It also refers to the COIL-RAG dataset specifically in the context of graph classification.

Moving on to the sections, the paper discusses experiments on datasets like Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed for node classification. These are standard citation network datasets. Additionally, the COIL-RAG dataset is mentioned for graph classification tasks.

I'll check the references section to find more details about these datasets. The references confirm that Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed are citation datasets, while COIL-RAG is a graph classification dataset.

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields. For each dataset, I'll note the creators, description, title, publication year, themes, keywords, and tasks they're used for.

Finally, I'll compile this information into a JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described based on the paper's usage.
