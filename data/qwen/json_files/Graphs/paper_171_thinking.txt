Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about graph neural distance metric learning using GRAPH-BERT. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll look through the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions benchmark datasets but doesn't name them. The introduction also talks about graph data but doesn't specify datasets yet.

Moving on to the related work section, I see references to various graph neural networks and metrics, but no datasets are mentioned here. The problem formulation and method sections discuss the approach but don't list datasets.

In the experiments section, the datasets are clearly mentioned: AIDS, LINUX, and IMDB. Each is described in terms of their use and characteristics. The AIDS dataset is used for graph edit distance, LINUX for similar purposes, and IMDB uses an average of multiple distances as ground truth.

I'll need to extract metadata for each of these datasets. The creators are the authors cited in the references. The descriptions are based on how the paper uses them. The titles are straightforward. The issued years are taken from the references. Themes, keywords, and tasks are derived from the context in which the datasets are used.

I'll structure each dataset with the required fields, ensuring accuracy based on the information provided in the paper.
