Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about CayleyNets, a type of graph convolutional neural network. I'll go through the paper section by section to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

Starting with the abstract, it mentions experiments on various tasks like spectral image classification, community detection, vertex classification, and matrix completion. These are tasks, not datasets, so I'll note them but look for specific dataset names.

In the introduction, the authors discuss applications of deep learning on graphs, such as social networks, regulatory networks, citation graphs, and brain networks. These are examples of graph structures, not datasets.

Moving to the related work section, they reference previous studies but don't mention specific datasets. The main contribution section introduces their new architecture but doesn't reference datasets.

In the experimental results section, they mention several datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits. They use it to demonstrate their model's performance on a grid graph.
2. **CORA**: A citation network dataset used for semi-supervised learning tasks, specifically vertex classification.
3. **MovieLens**: A dataset used for matrix completion tasks, which is a recommendation system problem.

Each of these datasets is used to evaluate the performance of CayleyNets in different tasks. The authors provide details on how they split the data and the results obtained.

I'll now structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset includes the necessary metadata fields as specified.
