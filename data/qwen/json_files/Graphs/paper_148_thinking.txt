Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about MultiVERSE, a method for embedding multiplex and multiplex-heterogeneous networks. The authors mention several datasets they used for evaluation.

First, I'll go through the paper to identify any datasets. In the evaluation section, they mention 7 multiplex networks: CKM, LAZEGA, C.ELE, ARXIV, HOMO, DIS, and MOL. They also mention two multiplex-heterogeneous networks: a gene-disease network and a drug-target network.

For each dataset, I need to extract the metadata. The creators are the authors of the datasets, but since the paper doesn't provide explicit references for these datasets, I'll assume the creators are the authors of the paper. The description should reflect how the datasets were used in the paper. The titles are straightforward. The issued year isn't provided, so it'll be empty. Language, identifier, landing page, version, and format aren't specified, so they'll be empty. Themes and keywords are based on the dataset's context, and tasks are the purposes for which the datasets were used.

I'll structure each dataset with the required fields, ensuring that each entry is accurate based on the information provided in the paper.
