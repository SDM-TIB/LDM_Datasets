Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses knowledge graphs (KGs) and their applications, mentioning tasks like entity alignment and type inference. It also references several datasets used for experiments.

Looking at the datasets section, I find mentions of DBP15K, YAGO26K-906, and DB111K-174. These are all knowledge graph datasets used for entity alignment and type inference tasks.

For each dataset, I need to extract the metadata:

1. **DBP15K**:
   - Created by Sun et al. (2017).
   - Description: A dataset for entity alignment across different languages in DBpedia.
   - Themes: Knowledge Graphs, Entity Alignment.
   - Keywords: Entity alignment, Cross-lingual, DBpedia.
   - Tasks: Entity alignment.

2. **YAGO26K-906**:
   - Created by Hao et al. (2019).
   - Description: A subset of YAGO for type inference, containing entities and concepts.
   - Themes: Knowledge Graphs, Type Inference.
   - Keywords: Type inference, YAGO.
   - Tasks: Type inference.

3. **DB111K-174**:
   - Created by Hao et al. (2019).
   - Description: A subset of DBpedia for type inference, containing entities and concepts.
   - Themes: Knowledge Graphs, Type Inference.
   - Keywords: Type inference, DBpedia.
   - Tasks: Type inference.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring all information is accurate and based on the paper's descriptions.
