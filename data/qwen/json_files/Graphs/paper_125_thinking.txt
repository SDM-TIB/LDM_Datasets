Alright, I need to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses community detection in heterogeneous and temporal graphs, using two real-world datasets: DBLP and IMDB.

Next, I'll check the sections where these datasets are described. In the "4.1 Datasets" section, the authors provide details about DBLP and IMDB. DBLP is a citation network dataset with nodes representing papers, authors, and conferences. IMDB is a dataset with nodes representing movies, actors, and directors.

I'll also look for any references or citations related to these datasets. The paper mentions URLs for DBLP and IMDB, which can serve as landing pages. However, there are no DOIs provided for these datasets.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information extracted. For each dataset, I'll include the creators, description, title, publication year, themes, keywords, landing page, and tasks.

I need to ensure that the creators are correctly identified. Since the datasets are widely used and not created by the paper's authors, I'll note that the creators are the organizations or communities that maintain these datasets.

Finally, I'll compile the information into the required JSON format, making sure to include all the necessary fields and structure the data correctly.
