Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper is about localizing visual sounds in videos without manual annotations. They mention introducing a new benchmark called VGG-Sound Source (VGG-SS) and using the Flickr SoundNet dataset.

Looking into the sections, Section 2.1 discusses existing datasets, mentioning Flickr SoundNet, AVE, and LLP. Section 4 details the creation of VGG-SS, which is based on the VGG-Sound dataset. The experiments in Section 5 mention training on Flickr SoundNet and VGG-Sound.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. Flickr SoundNet
2. VGG-Sound
3. VGG-Sound Source (VGG-SS)
4. AVE (Audio-Visual Event dataset)
5. LLP (Looking at People dataset)

Now, I'll gather metadata for each:
- **Flickr SoundNet**: Created by Aytar et al. in 2016, it's a large dataset with videos from Flickr, used for audio-visual learning.
- **VGG-Sound**: Introduced by Chen et al. in 2020, it's a large-scale dataset for audio-visual tasks.
- **VGG-SS**: Created by the paper's authors in 2020, it's a benchmark for sound source localization.
- **AVE**: Created by Tian et al. in 2018, focuses on audio-visual events.
- **LLP**: Created by Li et al. in 2020, focuses on audio-visual events with dense annotations.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring creators are correctly identified and descriptions are accurate based on the paper's usage.
