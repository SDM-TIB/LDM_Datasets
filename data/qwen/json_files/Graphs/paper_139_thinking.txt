Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract talks about network embeddings and mentions datasets like web networks, brain networks, citation networks, and street networks. However, these are general examples and not specific datasets.

Moving on to the introduction, the paper discusses various network types, including social networks, business transaction networks, and web of trust networks. Again, these are conceptual examples rather than specific datasets.

In Section II, under Background, the paper mentions several algorithms like DeepWalk, node2vec, LINE, DNGR, metapath2vec, GraphSAGE, M-NMF, LANE, PRUNE, RSDNE, and SIDE. These are algorithms, not datasets.

Looking at Section VI, which is the experimental evaluation, the paper lists the datasets used:

1. **BlogCatalog**: A network of bloggers with 10,312 nodes, 333,983 edges, and 39 labels.
2. **Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI)**: A network with 3,890 nodes, 38,292 edges, and 50 labels.
3. **Wikipedia**: A co-occurrence network with 4,777 nodes, 92,091 edges, and 40 labels.

These are the specific datasets used in the experiments. I'll need to extract metadata for each of these datasets.

For each dataset, I'll look for the creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, themes, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks. However, the paper doesn't provide detailed metadata for these datasets beyond their names and basic statistics. Therefore, I'll have to infer some information based on the context provided.

- **BlogCatalog**: It's a social network dataset, so the theme is social networks. The task is node classification.
- **PPI**: It's a biological network, so the theme is bioinformatics. The task is node classification.
- **Wikipedia**: It's a text-based network, so the theme is text mining. The task is node classification.

Since the paper doesn't provide DOIs or URLs for these datasets, the identifier and landing page fields will be empty. The creators are not explicitly mentioned, so those fields will also be empty.

Now, I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described based on the information available in the paper.
