Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about a Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach for semantic parsing, and it mentions several datasets used in their experiments. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. In the "5.1 Semantic Parsing Datasets" section, they mention three datasets: GEO, ATIS, and SPIDER. 

GEO is the GeoQuery dataset, which involves natural language questions about US geography. ATIS is the Air Travel Information System dataset, containing queries about travel planning. SPIDER is a large-scale text-to-SQL dataset with complex queries across various tables.

Next, I need to gather metadata for each dataset. The paper doesn't provide direct links or DOIs, but I can infer some details. For example, the authors of each dataset can be found in the references. GEO is cited as Zelle and Mooney (1996), ATIS as Dahl et al. (1994), and SPIDER as Yu et al. (2018c). 

The descriptions are based on how the paper uses these datasets. GEO and ATIS are used for semantic parsing into logical forms, while SPIDER is for text-to-SQL tasks. The themes are related to semantic parsing and natural language processing. The keywords include semantic parsing, logical forms, and text-to-SQL. 

Since the paper doesn't provide specific versions, landing pages, or formats, those fields will be left empty. The tasks are the specific uses mentioned in the paper, like generating logical forms or SQL queries.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring accuracy based on the information provided in the paper.
