Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions "skeleton-based action recognition" but doesn't specify datasets. Moving to the introduction, I see references to datasets like SBU Interaction and First-Person Hand Action (FPHA). These are likely the datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I'll check the "EXPERIMENTS" section for more details. Here, the paper explicitly mentions using the SBU Interaction dataset and the First-Person Hand Action (FPHA) dataset. The SBU dataset has 282 sequences with 8 categories, and FPHA has 1175 sequences across 45 categories. Both datasets involve skeleton data from Microsoft Kinect sensors.

I'll also look for any other datasets mentioned, but from the provided text, only SBU and FPHA are explicitly named. No other datasets are referenced in the paper.

Now, I'll gather the metadata for each dataset. For SBU Interaction, the creators are mentioned as Yun et al., and the year is 2012. For FPHA, the creators are Garcia-Hernando et al., and the year is 2018. The descriptions are based on how the paper uses these datasets for action recognition. The themes are "Computer Vision" and "Human Action Recognition," with keywords like "Skeleton data," "Action recognition," and "Human pose." The format is "Skeleton data," and the tasks are "Human Action Recognition."

I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset has all the specified metadata fields.
