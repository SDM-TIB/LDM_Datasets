Alright, I'm looking at the provided research paper to identify the datasets mentioned. The paper discusses quantization methods using retro-synthesis data and evaluates them on several datasets.

First, I notice that ImageNet is mentioned multiple times. It's a well-known dataset for image classification, so that's one dataset.

Next, the paper also references CIFAR-10. This is another standard dataset, commonly used for image classification tasks, especially in deep learning research.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned beyond these two. The authors use these datasets to test their quantization methods, comparing their results against state-of-the-art techniques.

So, the datasets identified are ImageNet and CIFAR-10. I'll structure the JSON accordingly, providing the necessary metadata for each.
