Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, the abstract mentions the British National Corpus (BNC) and LibriSpeech. The introduction also refers to these datasets. In the materials and methods section, under datasets, the authors detail their use of LibriSpeech and BNC. They mention that LibriSpeech is a corpus of English speech, primarily from US speakers, and BNC is a corpus of spontaneous conversations from UK speakers. 

Looking further, the authors also reference ESPnet, which is a toolkit, but not a dataset. They mention using a model from ESPnet, but that's more about the implementation rather than a dataset. 

In the results section, they discuss their findings using these datasets, but no new datasets are introduced. The references section includes citations for LibriSpeech and BNC, which I can use to gather more details about each dataset.

For LibriSpeech, the citation is from Panayotov et al., 2015, and it's a corpus of read English speech. BNC is cited from Coleman et al., 2012, and it's a corpus of spoken British English. 

I should also check if there are any other datasets mentioned, but from the paper, it seems only LibriSpeech and BNC are used. 

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper and the citations.
