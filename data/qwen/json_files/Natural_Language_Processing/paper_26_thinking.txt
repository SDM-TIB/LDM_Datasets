Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about a Multi-Perspective Inferrer (MPI) for Natural Language Inference (NLI). 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. I notice that the authors conducted experiments using two datasets: SNLI and MultiNLI. 

SNLI stands for Stanford Natural Language Inference dataset. It's a large-scale dataset for NLI tasks, containing sentence pairs labeled as entailment, neutral, or contradiction. The authors mention using SNLI for evaluation, so that's one dataset.

MultiNLI, or Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference dataset, is another dataset they used. It's designed to test models across different genres and domains, which makes it useful for evaluating robustness. The authors used both the matched and mismatched versions of MultiNLI.

Now, I need to extract the metadata for each dataset. For SNLI, the creators are Bowman et al., and it was published in 2015. The description mentions it's a large-scale dataset for NLI. The language is English, and the format is text. The tasks include NLI and entailment detection.

For MultiNLI, the creators are Williams et al., published in 2018. It's a multi-genre dataset for NLI, also in English, with the same tasks as SNLI.

I'll structure this information into JSON format, ensuring each dataset has all the required metadata fields. I'll make sure to include the creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, languages, themes, keywords, and tasks for each dataset.
