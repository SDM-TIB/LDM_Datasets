Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Multi-label Categorization of Accounts of Sexism using a Neural Framework" by Pulkit Parikh and others. The abstract mentions that they developed a dataset comprising 13,023 accounts of sexism, each tagged with at least one of 23 categories. This dataset is their main contribution.

Looking further into the introduction, they mention that the dataset is created from the Everyday Sexism Project website. They crawled this site to gather accounts of sexism from survivors and observers. The dataset is described as the largest dataset for sexism categorization.

In the dataset construction section, they detail how they collected data from the Everyday Sexism Project, annotated it with 23 categories, and merged some categories for experiments. They also mention using unlabeled data from the same site to fine-tune BERT models.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The primary dataset is their own, created from the Everyday Sexism Project data. They don't reference other datasets for their experiments beyond their own.

So, the only dataset mentioned is their own, which they created and used for their research.
