Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses neural machine translation and adversarial examples. It mentions experiments on different language pairs and models.

In the "4.1 Data Sets" section, the authors specify the datasets used for training and testing their models. They mention:

1. **En-De (English-German)**: Using WMT14 and WMT15 data.
2. **En-Fr (English-French)**: Using WMT14 and WMT15 data.
3. **Zh-En (Chinese-English)**: Using LDC data.

Additionally, they reference NIST test sets for Chinese-English and WMT test sets for English-French.

I'll need to extract metadata for each of these datasets. However, the paper doesn't provide detailed references for each dataset, so I'll have to infer based on the information given.

For each dataset, I'll note the language pairs, the source (like WMT or LDC), and the year if mentioned. Since the creators aren't specified, I'll leave that field empty. The description will be based on how the datasets were used in the paper.

I'll structure each dataset entry with the required metadata fields, ensuring that each field is filled based on the information available in the paper.
