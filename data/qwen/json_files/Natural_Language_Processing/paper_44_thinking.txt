Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses enhancing encoder-decoder models for open-domain conversational agents by modeling coherence and diversity. They mention using the OpenSubtitles corpus for experiments.

Looking through the sections, I find that the OpenSubtitles corpus is referenced in the abstract and the introduction. It's used for training and evaluating their models. The authors also mention filtering this corpus to create a more coherent dataset called fOST (iltered OpenSubtitles).

I need to check if there are any other datasets mentioned. Scanning through the rest of the paper, I don't find any other datasets referenced. The focus is on the OpenSubtitles corpus and its filtered version.

Now, I'll gather the metadata for each dataset:

1. **OpenSubtitles Corpus**:
   - **Creator**: The authors of the paper don't mention the creators, but from the reference, it's cited as Lison and Meena (2016).
   - **Description**: A large corpus of movie and TV subtitles used for training and evaluation.
   - **Title**: OpenSubtitles
   - **Issued**: 2016
   - **Language**: English
   - **Identifier**: URL from the reference.
   - **Theme**: Natural Language Processing, Dialogue Systems
   - **Keywords**: Subtitles, Dialogue, Conversation
   - **Landing Page**: URL provided.
   - **Version**: Not mentioned.
   - **Format**: Text
   - **Task**: Dialogue Generation, Response Generation

2. **fOST (iltered OpenSubtitles)**:
   - **Creator**: The authors of the paper (Xinnuo Xu, Ondrej Dusek, Ioannis Konstas, Verena Rieser) created this filtered version.
   - **Description**: A subset of OpenSubtitles filtered for coherence.
   - **Title**: fOST
   - **Issued**: Not specified, but derived from OpenSubtitles 2016.
   - **Language**: English
   - **Identifier**: Same as OpenSubtitles.
   - **Theme**: Natural Language Processing, Dialogue Systems
   - **Keywords**: Filtered, Coherence, Dialogue
   - **Landing Page**: Same as OpenSubtitles.
   - **Version**: Not mentioned.
   - **Format**: Text
   - **Task**: Dialogue Generation, Response Generation

I need to ensure that the creators are correctly identified. For OpenSubtitles, the creators are the ones cited in the reference. For fOST, since it's a filtered version by the paper's authors, they are the creators.

I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, making sure each field is accurately filled based on the paper's content.
