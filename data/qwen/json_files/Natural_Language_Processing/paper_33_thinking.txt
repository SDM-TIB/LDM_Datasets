Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses adversarial misspellings and proposes a word recognition model. It mentions experiments on sentiment analysis and paraphrase detection tasks.

In the "Experiments and Results" section, the authors reference the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) and the IMDB movie reviews dataset. They also mention the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC).

Looking at the references, I find that the SST dataset is cited as Socher et al., 2013, and the IMDB dataset is cited as Maas et al., 2011. The MRPC is cited as Dolan and Brockett, 2005.

Now, I'll extract the metadata for each dataset:

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**
   - Creator: Socher et al.
   - Description: A dataset for sentiment analysis with movie reviews.
   - Title: Stanford Sentiment Treebank
   - Issued: 2013
   - Language: English

   - Theme: Sentiment Analysis
   - Keywords: Sentiment, Movie Reviews

   - Format: Text
   - Task: Sentiment Analysis

2. **IMDB Movie Reviews**
   - Creator: Maas et al.
   - Description: A large dataset of movie reviews for sentiment analysis.
   - Title: IMDB Movie Reviews
   - Issued: 2011
   - Language: English
   - Identifier: arXiv:1103.0398
   - Theme: Sentiment Analysis
   - Keywords: Movie Reviews, Sentiment
   - Landing Page: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/
   - Format: Text
   - Task: Sentiment Analysis

3. **Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC)**
   - Creator: Dolan and Brockett
   - Description: A dataset for paraphrase detection.
   - Title: Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus
   - Issued: 2005
   - Language: English
   - Identifier: arXiv:cs/0506086
   - Theme: Paraphrase Detection

   - Landing Page: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/microsoft-research-paraphrase-corpus/
   - Format: Text
   - Task: Paraphrase Detection

I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described with the appropriate metadata.
