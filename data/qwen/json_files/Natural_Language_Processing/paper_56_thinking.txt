Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses machine translation using Transformers and context gates. It mentions experiments on four translation datasets. I should note these datasets as they are crucial for the analysis.

Moving to the methodology section, I don't see any additional datasets mentioned beyond what's already noted in the introduction. The focus here is on the model architecture and regularization techniques.

In the experiments section, the datasets are explicitly listed. The paper evaluates on four benchmark datasets: NIST IWSLT14 ZH-EN, WMT14 EN-DE, IWSLT14 DE-EN, and IWSLT17 FR-EN. These are all standard datasets in machine translation.

I'll check the references to find more details about each dataset. For example, NIST datasets are often used for evaluation in machine translation tasks. WMT14 and IWSLT14/17 are well-known in the field, providing parallel text data for training and testing translation models.

Each dataset's metadata needs to be extracted. The creators are typically the organizations or authors who compiled the datasets. Descriptions should reflect how the datasets were used in the paper, such as for training or evaluation. The titles are straightforward, and the issued years can be found in the references or dataset descriptions.

Languages involved are specified in the dataset names, like ZH-EN for Chinese-English. Identifiers might include URLs or DOIs if available, but the paper doesn't provide these. Themes are related to machine translation and natural language processing. Keywords should include terms like "machine translation," "parallel corpus," and specific dataset names.

Landing pages aren't provided in the paper, so those fields will be empty. Versions aren't mentioned, so those remain empty as well. The format is text since these are textual datasets. The tasks are machine translation and language modeling, as these datasets are used to evaluate translation models.

I'll structure each dataset entry with the extracted metadata, ensuring all fields are filled based on the information available in the paper. If a field isn't specified, it will be left empty to maintain accuracy.
