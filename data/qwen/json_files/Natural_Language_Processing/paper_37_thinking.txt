Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper titled "TENER: Adapting Transformer Encoder for Named Entity Recognition." The paper discusses the use of various datasets to evaluate their proposed model, TENER, which is a Named Entity Recognition (NER) architecture using an adapted Transformer Encoder.

First, I'll go through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The datasets are likely to be listed in the sections discussing experiments, results, and data sources. 

Looking at the paper, I find that the authors evaluated their model on six NER datasets. These include two English datasets and four Chinese datasets. The English datasets are CoNLL2003 and OntoNotes 5.0. The Chinese datasets are OntoNotes 4.0, MSRA, Weibo, and Resume.

For each dataset, I need to extract the required metadata fields. Let's break down each dataset:

1. **CoNLL2003**: This is a well-known English NER dataset. It contains four entity types: PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, and MISC. The creators are typically the authors who published the dataset, which in this case is the CoNLL 2003 shared task organizers. The dataset was issued in 2003. It's in English, and the format is text. The task is NER.

2. **OntoNotes 5.0**: This dataset is more extensive, covering various domains. It includes eleven entity names and seven value types. The creators are the OntoNotes team, and it was issued in 2011. It's in English, and the format is text. The task is NER.

3. **OntoNotes 4.0 (Chinese)**: This is the Chinese version of OntoNotes. The creators are the same as OntoNotes 5.0, and it was issued in 2011. It's in Chinese, and the format is text. The task is NER.

4. **MSRA**: This dataset is from the MSRA corpus, used for Chinese NER. The creators are the authors who published it, likely from Microsoft Research Asia. It was issued in 2006. It's in Chinese, and the format is text. The task is NER.

5. **Weibo**: This dataset is based on Chinese social media text from Sina Weibo. The creators are the authors who published it, likely Peng and Dredze. It was issued in 2015. It's in Chinese, and the format is text. The task is NER.

6. **Resume**: This dataset is annotated for Chinese NER in resumes. The creators are the authors who published it, likely Zhang and Yang. It was issued in 2018. It's in Chinese, and the format is text. The task is NER.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the specified metadata fields. I'll ensure that each field is accurately filled based on the information extracted from the paper.
