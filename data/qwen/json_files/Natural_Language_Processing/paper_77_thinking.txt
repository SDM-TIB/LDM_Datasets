Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions the WMT14 English-to-German and NIST Chinese-to-English translation tasks. These are likely datasets used for evaluation.

Moving to the introduction, the authors reference the Transformer model by Vaswani et al., 2017, but that's a model, not a dataset. They also mention Chen et al., 2018, and Hao et al., 2019, but these are other research works, not datasets.

In the experiments section (Section 5), the authors detail their evaluation on two datasets: WMT14 English-to-German and NIST Chinese-to-English. The WMT14 dataset includes 4.43 million bilingual sentence pairs, while the NIST dataset has 1.28 million bilingual sentence pairs. These datasets are used for training and evaluation.

Looking at the references, I find that the WMT14 dataset is cited as part of the WMT14 news translation task, and the NIST dataset is referenced in the context of Chinese-to-English translation tasks.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors primarily focus on their proposed method and its evaluation on these two datasets.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information extracted.
