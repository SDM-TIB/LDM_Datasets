Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about a deep patent landscaping model using Transformers and graph embedding. The authors mention several datasets, so I need to identify each one and extract their metadata.

First, I'll read through the paper to find any datasets. The abstract mentions benchmark datasets for patent landscaping. In the introduction, they talk about the lack of well-defined benchmark datasets. Then, in section 3, they describe the KISTA datasets for patent landscaping. They mention four specific datasets: MPUART, MWDFSTechnology, MRRG, and GOCS.

Each of these datasets is built from Google BigQuery using search queries from a Korean patent attorney. The datasets are used to evaluate the proposed model. The authors provide details about each dataset, including the number of patents, valid patents, and URLs for accessing the datasets.

I need to extract each dataset's metadata. The creators are the authors of the paper since they created the datasets. The description should summarize how the datasets were built and their purpose. The titles are the names of the datasets. The issued date isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll leave it empty. The language is English since the datasets are described in English. The identifiers are the URLs provided. The themes are related to patent landscaping and machine learning. Keywords include patent landscaping, benchmark datasets, etc. The landing pages are the URLs. The format is text since the datasets are based on patent documents. The tasks are patent classification and landscaping.

I'll structure each dataset into the required JSON format, ensuring all fields are filled appropriately based on the information from the paper.
