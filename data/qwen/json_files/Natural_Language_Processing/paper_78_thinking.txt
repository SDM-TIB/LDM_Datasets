Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper is about Baidu's neural machine translation systems for WMT19. It discusses various techniques and datasets used in their models.

Looking at the sections, I see references to several datasets:

1. **News Corpus**: Mentioned in the context of back translation. It's a common dataset used in machine translation tasks.

2. **Gigaword**: Another dataset used for back translation. It's a large corpus of news articles.

3. **CWMT (Chinese-English Web Machine Translation)**: Referenced in the training data statistics. It's a dataset for Chinese-English translation.

4. **UN Corpus**: Used for both Chinese and English language modeling and translation tasks.

5. **Wiki Titles Corpus**: Mentioned as part of the training data for English-Chinese translation.

6. **WMT18 Dev and Test Sets**: Used for evaluation, including the News dev 2018 and News test 2018.

Now, I'll gather metadata for each dataset:

- **News Corpus**: Creator is not specified, description is a collection of news articles, title is News Corpus, issued year not provided, language is multilingual, identifier and landing page are empty, theme is machine translation, keyword is news articles, format is text, task is machine translation.

- **Gigaword**: Similar to News Corpus, but more specific as it's a large corpus of news articles.

- **CWMT**: Creator not specified, description is a Chinese-English corpus, issued year not provided, language is Chinese and English, theme is machine translation, keyword is Chinese-English.

- **UN Corpus**: Creator is the United Nations, description is a multilingual corpus, language is multiple, theme is machine translation.

- **Wiki Titles Corpus**: Creator is Wikimedia, description is titles from Wikipedia, language is multiple, theme is machine translation.

- **WMT18 Dev and Test Sets**: Creator is the WMT organizers, description is evaluation datasets, language is Chinese and English, theme is machine translation.

I'll structure each dataset according to the metadata fields, ensuring all required fields are filled where possible. If information isn't available, I'll leave the field empty.
