Alright, I'm looking at the provided research paper titled "What BERT Sees: Cross-Modal Transfer for Visual Question Generation." The task is to extract all the datasets mentioned in this paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary.

First, I'll scan through the paper to identify any datasets. The paper discusses experiments conducted on two datasets: VQGCOCO and VQA1.0. 

For VQGCOCO, the authors reference Mostafazadeh et al. (2016). This dataset contains images with corresponding questions and captions. It's used for evaluating the model's performance in generating questions based on images.

Next, VQA1.0 is referenced from Antol et al. (2015). This dataset is used for visual question answering but is adapted here for visual question generation. It includes a large number of images with associated questions.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields. For creators, I'll list the authors from the references. Descriptions will be based on how the datasets are used in the paper. The titles are straightforward. Issued years are taken from the references. Since these datasets are image-based, the format is image. Themes, keywords, and tasks are derived from the context in which the datasets are used.

I ensure that each dataset entry is accurate and follows the specified JSON format without any additional text or explanations.
