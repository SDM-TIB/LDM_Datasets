Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "PAWS-X: A Cross-lingual Adversarial Dataset for Paraphrase Identification" by Yinfei Yang and others. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get a sense of what datasets are being discussed. The abstract mentions PAWS-X as a new dataset, so that's definitely one. It also references PAWS, which seems to be the original dataset that PAWS-X is an extension of. 

Looking further into the introduction, the authors talk about existing datasets like Multi30k and Opusparcus, which are used for paraphrase identification but lack challenging examples. PAWS-X is introduced as a response to this gap, providing adversarial examples across multiple languages.

In the section about the PAWS-X corpus, the authors explain that it's created by translating the Wikipedia portion of the original PAWS dataset into six languages: French, Spanish, German, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. They mention that the original PAWS dataset was created by Zhang et al. in 2019, so that's another dataset to note.

The paper also references other datasets used in experiments, such as Multi30k and Opusparcus, but these are mentioned in the context of their limitations, not as datasets used in the current study beyond comparison.

I should also check the references section to confirm the details of these datasets. The references include Zhang et al. (2019) for PAWS and Elliott et al. (2016) for Multi30k, as well as Creutz (2018) for Opusparcus. However, since the focus is on PAWS-X and PAWS, those are the primary datasets to extract.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided:

1. **PAWS-X**: Created by Yinfei Yang and others, it's a cross-lingual dataset with human-translated pairs across six languages. It's used for paraphrase identification and adversarial examples. The landing page is provided, and it's in multiple languages.

2. **PAWS**: Created by Zhang et al., it's the original English dataset used to generate PAWS-X. It's focused on paraphrase identification with adversarial examples, using Wikipedia and Quora data.

I need to ensure that each dataset's metadata is accurately filled, including creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, languages, identifiers, themes, keywords, landing pages, versions, formats, and tasks.

For PAWS-X, the creators are the authors of the paper. The description includes the number of pairs and languages. The landing page is the GitHub repository mentioned. The tasks include paraphrase identification and cross-lingual learning.

For PAWS, the creators are Zhang et al. The description focuses on its adversarial nature and sources. The task is paraphrase identification.

I should avoid including datasets like Multi30k and Opusparcus since they're not directly used in the current study beyond being mentioned as existing works.
