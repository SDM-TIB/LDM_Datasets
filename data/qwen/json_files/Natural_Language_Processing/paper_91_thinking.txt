Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions the HASOC 2019 shared task, which involves datasets for Hindi, English, and German languages. This is a key pointâ€”HASOC is the main dataset used here.

Moving to the introduction, the authors discuss the complexity of hate speech in India and mention the HASOC 2019 task again. They also reference other shared tasks like HaSpeeDe, GermEval, AMI, and HatEval, but these are mentioned in passing, not as datasets used in their work.

In the "Dataset and Task description" section, the authors provide detailed statistics about the HASOC dataset. They mention that the dataset includes three languages: Hindi, English, and German, with subtasks A, B, and C. This confirms that HASOC is the primary dataset used.

Looking at the references, I find that the HASOC dataset is cited as reference [19]. The authors also mention other datasets like GermEval and HatEval, but these are not used in their experiments; they're just mentioned as related work.

I should also check if any other datasets are mentioned. The authors reference BERT and LASER embeddings, but these are models, not datasets. They also mention URLs for their GitHub repository and a tinyurl link, but these aren't datasets either.

So, the only dataset explicitly used and described in detail is the HASOC 2019 dataset. I'll extract its metadata based on the information provided in the paper.
