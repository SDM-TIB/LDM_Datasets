Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "Enriching Word Vectors with Subword Information" by Piotr Bojanowski and others. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned. The abstract mentions that they evaluate their word representations on nine different languages, both on word similarity and analogy tasks. This suggests they used datasets for these evaluations.

Looking at the introduction, they reference various works but don't mention specific datasets. The related work section discusses other methods but again, no specific datasets. 

In the experimental setup (Section 4), they mention using Wikipedia data in nine languages: Arabic, Czech, German, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Romanian, and Russian. They also mention using Matt Mahoney's preprocessing script. 

In Section 5, they discuss evaluating on word similarity and analogy tasks. They reference several datasets:
- WS353 for English
- RW (rare words) dataset
- GUR65, GUR350, ZG222 for German
- RG65 for French
- Datasets described in Hassan and Mihalcea (2009) for Spanish, Arabic, and Romanian
- HJ dataset for Russian

Additionally, they mention using the datasets from Mikolov et al. (2013a) for word analogy tasks in English, German, and Italian.

I need to structure each of these datasets with the required metadata. For each dataset, I'll extract the creator, description, title, year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For example, WS353 is a word similarity dataset for English, created by Finkelstein et al. in 2001. It's used for evaluating word representations.

I'll go through each dataset mentioned, extract the relevant information, and format them into JSON objects as per the specified structure.
