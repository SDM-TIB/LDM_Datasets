Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses pre-training strategies for Chinese BERT and introduces MacBERT. It mentions several datasets used for evaluation.

Looking at the sections, especially the "V. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP" and "VI. RESULTS", I see references to various datasets. Let me list them out:

1. **CMRC 2018**: A Chinese machine reading comprehension dataset.
2. **DRCD**: Another Chinese reading comprehension dataset in Traditional Chinese.
3. **CJRC**: A Chinese judicial reading comprehension dataset.
4. **ChnSentiCorp**: A Chinese sentiment analysis dataset.
5. **THUCNews**: A Chinese news classification dataset.
6. **TNEWS**: A Chinese text classification dataset.
7. **XNLI**: A cross-lingual natural language inference dataset, including Chinese.
8. **LCQMC**: A large-scale Chinese question matching corpus.
9. **BQ Corpus**: A Chinese sentence pair semantic equivalence dataset.
10. **OCNLI**: A Chinese natural language inference dataset.

Now, I'll gather details for each dataset:

- **CMRC 2018**: Created by Yiming Cui and others, it's a span-extraction dataset for Chinese MRC.
- **DRCD**: Created by C. C. Shao and others, focuses on Traditional Chinese MRC.
- **CJRC**: Created by X. Duan and others, involves legal texts.
- **ChnSentiCorp**: Created by S. Tan and J. Zhang, for sentiment analysis.
- **THUCNews**: Created by J. Li and M. Sun, for news classification.
- **TNEWS**: Part of the CLUE benchmark, created by L. Xu and others.
- **XNLI**: Created by A. Conneau and others, includes Chinese.
- **LCQMC**: Created by X. Liu and others, for question matching.
- **BQ Corpus**: Created by J. Chen and others, for semantic equivalence.
- **OCNLI**: Created by H. Hu and others, for NLI in Chinese.

Each dataset's description, language, and tasks are based on how they're used in the paper. I'll structure this into JSON format as required.
