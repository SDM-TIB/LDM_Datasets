Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Multilingual Culture-Independent Word Analogy Datasets" by Matej Uljcar and others. It discusses the creation of word analogy datasets for nine languages: Croatian, English, Estonian, Finnish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Russian, Slovenian, and Swedish. The datasets are designed to be culturally neutral and include both monolingual and cross-lingual analogies.

Looking through the sections, the datasets are described in detail in Sections 2, 3, and 4. The authors mention that they created datasets for each language and also cross-lingual datasets for all 72 language pairs. The datasets are composed of 15 categories, 5 semantic and 10 syntactic/morphological.

I need to identify the datasets mentioned. The main dataset seems to be the collection of word analogy datasets for the nine languages. There's also a reference to the original dataset by Mikolov et al. (2013a), which is the English word analogy dataset. Additionally, the authors mention using fastText embeddings, but that's a model, not a dataset.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. The multilingual culture-independent word analogy datasets created by the authors for nine languages.
2. The original English word analogy dataset by Mikolov et al. (2013a).

Now, I'll extract the metadata for each dataset.

For the first dataset:
- **dcterms:creator**: The authors of the paper: Matej Uljcar, Kristiina Vaik, Jessica Lindström, Milda Dailidienė, Marko Robnik-Šikonja.
- **dcterms:description**: A collection of word analogy datasets for nine languages, designed to be culturally neutral, including both monolingual and cross-lingual analogies.
- **dcterms:title**: Multilingual Culture-Independent Word Analogy Datasets.
- **dcterms:issued**: The paper was published in 2020, so the dataset's publication year is likely 2020.
- **dcterms:language**: The languages included are Croatian, English, Estonian, Finnish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Russian, Slovenian, and Swedish.
- **dcterms:identifier**: The paper's DOI is 10.13140/RG.2.2.34683.54285, but the dataset might have its own identifier. Since it's not provided, I'll leave it empty.
- **dcat:theme**: Word analogy, embeddings evaluation, multilingual datasets.
- **dcat:keyword**: Word embeddings, analogy task, evaluation, less-resourced languages.
- **dcat:landingPage**: The dataset is available on the CLARIN repository: http://hdl.handle.net/11356/1261.
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Not mentioned.
- **dcterms:format**: Text.
- **mls:task**: Evaluation of word embeddings, word analogy tasks.

For the second dataset (Mikolov et al. 2013a):
- **dcterms:creator**: Tomas Mikolov, Kai Chen, Greg Corrado, Jeffrey Dean.
- **dcterms:description**: The original English word analogy dataset used as a basis for the multilingual datasets.
- **dcterms:title**: English Word Analogy Dataset.
- **dcterms:issued**: 2013.
- **dcterms:language**: English.
- **dcterms:identifier**: The URL provided in the paper is http://download.tensorflow.org/data/questions-words.txt.
- **dcat:theme**: Word analogy, embeddings evaluation.
- **dcat:keyword**: Word embeddings, analogy task, English language.
- **dcat:landingPage**: http://download.tensorflow.org/data/questions-words.txt.
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Not mentioned.
- **dcterms:format**: Text.
- **mls:task**: Evaluation of word embeddings, word analogy tasks.
