Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses undirected neural sequence models like BERT and their application to machine translation. It mentions experiments on the WMT14 English-German dataset.

Looking into the sections, the data and preprocessing section details the use of WMT14 English-German with 4.5M parallel sentences. They also mention using a pretrained model from XLM, specifically mlm_2019, which was trained on NewsCrawl data.

In the experimental settings, they reference the WMT14 dataset, including newstest-2013 and newstest-2014 as validation and test sets. They also use a pretrained model from Facebook AI Research (FAIR) for their experiments.

I need to identify each dataset mentioned, extract the required metadata, and format it into JSON. For each dataset, I'll look for creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, themes, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

WMT14 English-German is a well-known dataset, so I can find its creators and other details. The XLM pretrained model is another dataset, and I'll gather its information as well.

I'll structure each dataset into a JSON object with the specified fields, ensuring all relevant metadata is included. If some details aren't explicitly mentioned, I'll leave those fields empty.

Finally, I'll compile all the datasets into a JSON array, making sure each entry is correctly formatted and contains all available information.
