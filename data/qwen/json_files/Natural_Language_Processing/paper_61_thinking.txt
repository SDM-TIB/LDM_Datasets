Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "The MLLP-UPV Spanish-Portuguese and Portuguese-Spanish Machine Translation Systems for WMT19 Similar Language Translation Task." It describes the participation of the MLLP research group in the WMT19 Similar Language Translation Shared Task. They used various corpora for training their machine translation models.

Looking through the sections, I find that in Section 3.1, the authors describe the training corpora. They mention four datasets: JCR, Europarl, news-commentary, and wikititles. These are used for training the Spanish-Portuguese and Portuguese-Spanish translation systems.

I need to extract metadata for each of these datasets. Let's go through each one:

1. **JCR Corpus**: The paper doesn't provide specific details about the creators, publication date, or other metadata. It's likely a domain-specific corpus, but without more information, I can only note it as mentioned.

2. **Europarl Corpus**: This is a well-known corpus of European Parliament proceedings. It's multilingual and often used in machine translation. The creators are typically the European Parliament, but the paper doesn't specify. The description would be about legislative texts.

3. **News-Commentary Corpus**: This is another standard corpus used in machine translation, containing news commentary texts. Again, the creators and specific details aren't provided in the paper.

4. **Wikititles Corpus**: This corpus likely contains Wikipedia titles and their translations. The description would focus on multilingual Wikipedia titles.

For each dataset, I'll extract the available metadata as per the vocabulary. Since the paper doesn't provide detailed references for these datasets, some fields like creators, identifiers, and landing pages might remain empty.

I'll structure each dataset entry with the available information, ensuring that each field is filled if possible, or left empty if not specified.
