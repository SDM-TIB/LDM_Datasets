Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about Microsoft Translator's submission to the WMT 2019 news translation task, focusing on document-level neural machine translation using transformer models. 

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the WMT19 news translation task, so that's one dataset. The introduction also refers to WMT19, so that's consistent. 

Looking further, the paper discusses using data from previous years, like WMT18, which suggests they're using the same dataset but from a different year. They mention using Europarl, Rapid, and News-Commentary as subsets of parallel data. These are all standard datasets in machine translation. 

The paper also talks about news crawl data, which is typically large-scale and used for training. They mention back-translating the entire news crawl data, so that's another dataset. 

In the data preparation section, they use document boundaries from authentic and synthetic parallel data. This indicates they're using the same WMT datasets but processing them differently. 

They also reference monolingual news crawl data for English, which is another dataset used for training. 

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. WMT19 news translation task data
2. WMT18 news translation task data
3. Europarl
4. Rapid
5. News-Commentary
6. News crawl data (likely from WMT or similar sources)

Each of these datasets is used for training or evaluation in their machine translation models. I'll need to structure this information into the required JSON format, providing details like creators, descriptions, titles, etc., based on the paper's references.
