Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses efficient contextual representation learning without a softmax layer, focusing on language models like ELMo, GPT, and BERT. It mentions datasets used for training and evaluation.

Looking into the sections, I find references to several datasets:

1. **One Billion Word Benchmark**: This is mentioned in the context of training ELMo and other models. It's a large corpus used for language modeling tasks.

2. **Common Crawl Corpus**: Used for training FastText embeddings, which are then used in the SEMFIT layer.

3. **SNLI Dataset**: Used for the textual entailment task, which is one of the downstream tasks evaluated.

4. **CoNLL 2012 Shared Task**: Related to coreference resolution, another downstream task.

5. **SST-5 Dataset**: Used for sentiment analysis, another downstream task.

6. **CoNLL 2003 NER Task**: Used for named entity recognition, a downstream task.

7. **CoNLL 2013 SRL Dataset**: Used for semantic role labeling, another downstream task.

8. **SQuAD Dataset**: Mentioned but not available for implementation in the experiments.

Now, I'll gather the details for each dataset:

- **One Billion Word Benchmark**: Created by Chelba et al. in 2013, used for training language models. It's a large text corpus.

- **Common Crawl Corpus**: A massive web crawl dataset, used for training word embeddings.

- **SNLI Dataset**: Created by Bowman et al. in 2015, for textual entailment.

- **CoNLL 2012 Shared Task**: Created by Pradhan et al. in 2012, for coreference resolution.

- **SST-5 Dataset**: Created by Socher et al. in 2013, for sentiment analysis.

- **CoNLL 2003 NER Task**: Created by Sang and De Meulder in 2003, for named entity recognition.

- **CoNLL 2013 SRL Dataset**: Created by Pradhan et al. in 2013, for semantic role labeling.

- **SQuAD Dataset**: Created by Rajpurkar et al. in 2016, for question answering, but not used in the experiments.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring accuracy based on the paper's references.
