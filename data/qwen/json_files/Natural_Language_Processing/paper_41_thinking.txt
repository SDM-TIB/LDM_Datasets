Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper is about an Automatic Post-Editing (APE) model using Transformer. It mentions datasets used in experiments.

Looking at the "3.1 Dataset" section, the paper uses the WMT19 official English-German APE dataset. It also mentions the eSCAPE-NMT dataset and an eSCAPE-NMT-filtered version. 

For each dataset, I need to extract the metadata fields:

1. **WMT19 English-German APE dataset**:
   - Creator: The authors of the dataset are likely the ones cited in the reference. The paper cites Chatterjee et al., 2018, so they are the creators.
   - Description: It's the official dataset for the WMT19 APE task, containing training and development sets.
   - Title: WMT19 English-German APE dataset.
   - Issued: 2019.
   - Language: English and German.
   - Identifier: Not provided.
   - Theme: Machine Translation, APE.
   - Keywords: APE, WMT, English-German.
   - Landing Page: Not provided.
   - Version: Not mentioned.
   - Format: Text.
   - Task: Automatic Post-Editing.

2. **eSCAPE-NMT dataset**:
   - Creator: Negri et al., 2018.
   - Description: A large synthetic corpus for APE, used as additional training data.
   - Title: eSCAPE-NMT.
   - Issued: 2018.
   - Language: English and German.
   - Identifier: Not provided.
   - Theme: Machine Translation, Synthetic Corpus.
   - Keywords: eSCAPE, NMT, APE.
   - Landing Page: Not provided.
   - Version: Not mentioned.
   - Format: Text.
   - Task: Automatic Post-Editing.

3. **eSCAPE-NMT-filtered dataset**:
   - Creator: Same as eSCAPE-NMT.
   - Description: Filtered version of eSCAPE-NMT, used for training.
   - Title: eSCAPE-NMT-filtered.
   - Issued: 2018.
   - Language: English and German.
   - Identifier: Not provided.
   - Theme: Machine Translation, Synthetic Corpus.
   - Keywords: eSCAPE, NMT, APE, filtered.
   - Landing Page: Not provided.
   - Version: Filtered version.
   - Format: Text.
   - Task: Automatic Post-Editing.

I need to ensure each dataset is correctly identified and all metadata fields are filled based on the information provided in the paper. If any field isn't mentioned, it should be left empty.
