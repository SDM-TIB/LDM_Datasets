Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper focuses on analyzing syntactic structures captured by BERT using self-attention mechanisms. It mentions comparing BERT relations to Universal Dependencies (UD) annotations. So, UD is a key dataset here.

Moving to the "Models and Data" section, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **EuroParl**: They use 1000 EuroParl multi-parallel sentences for five European languages, annotated with UDPipe UD 2.0 models. EuroParl is a well-known dataset for machine translation and multilingual NLP tasks.

2. **Google Universal Dependency Treebanks (GSD)**: Specifically for Indonesian, Korean, and Japanese. These treebanks are part of the Universal Dependencies initiative.

3. **UD Turkish Treebank (IMST-UD)**: This is another specific treebank used for Turkish.

4. **PUD treebanks from the CoNLL 2017 Shared Task**: These are used for evaluation across all languages.

Additionally, the authors reference the **UD 2.0** annotations and modifications they made to better fit BERT's syntax.

I'll note each of these datasets, their creators, descriptions, and other metadata as per the required fields. For each dataset, I'll extract the necessary information like creators, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, themes, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

Now, I'll structure each dataset into the specified JSON format, ensuring all fields are filled based on the information extracted from the paper.
