Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions VQA v2.0 and TDIUC datasets. These are likely the main datasets used in the study.

Next, I'll check the sections where datasets are typically discussed, such as the "Experiments" section. In the paper, under "4.1. Dataset," it explicitly states that experiments were conducted on VQA v2.0 and TDIUC datasets. Both are benchmark datasets for Visual Question Answering.

I should also verify if there are any other datasets mentioned elsewhere in the paper. Scanning through the rest of the document, I don't find any additional datasets beyond VQA v2.0 and TDIUC.

Now, I'll gather the necessary metadata for each dataset. For VQA v2.0, the creators are Antol et al., and it's a visual question answering dataset. The description should include its purpose and content. Similarly, TDIUC is another VQA dataset, created by Kafke et al., with a focus on diverse question types.

I'll structure each dataset entry with the required fields: creator, description, title, issued year, language, identifier, theme, keyword, landing page, version, format, and task. Since some details like DOIs or URLs aren't provided in the paper, those fields will remain empty.

Finally, I'll compile the JSON response with the extracted datasets, ensuring each field is accurately filled based on the information from the paper.
