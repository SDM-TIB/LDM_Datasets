Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Empirical Evaluation of Sequence-to-Sequence Models for Word Discovery in Low-resource Settings" by Marcely Zanon Boito, Aline Villavicencio, and Laurent Besacier. The abstract mentions experiments on Mboshi and English languages aligned to French, but doesn't specify datasets yet.

Looking at the introduction, they discuss using attention-based models for word discovery from phoneme sequences. They mention experiments on a low-resource scenario with Mboshi and English, both aligned to French. This suggests they're using specific corpora for these languages.

In the Experimental Settings section, under 2.2, they explicitly mention two parallel speech corpora: English-French (EN-FR) and Mboshi-French (MB-FR). The EN-FR corpus is a 33,192 sentences multilingual extension from LibriSpeech, with English audio books automatically aligned to French translations. The MB-FR corpus is a 5,130 sentences corpus from the language documentation process of Mboshi, an endangered language spoken in Congo-Brazzaville.

They also mention that the EN-FR corpus was down-sampled to 5K utterances to match the size of the MB-FR corpus. This indicates they used both the full and down-sampled versions of the EN-FR corpus.

Additionally, they reference the LibriSpeech corpus, which is a well-known dataset for speech recognition tasks. The EN-FR corpus is an extension of LibriSpeech, so it's relevant here.

Now, I'll check the references section for more details on these datasets. The references include citations for the EN-FR and MB-FR corpora, providing creators, descriptions, and other metadata.

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata fields:

1. **EN-FR Corpus (33K)**:
   - Creators: Aline Villavicencio, Marcely Zanon Boito, Laurent Besacier (as per the paper's authors, since the dataset is their own creation for this study).
   - Description: A large multilingual corpus with 33,192 sentences, English audio books aligned to French translations.
   - Title: EN-FR Corpus (33K)
   - Issued: 2018 (as per the paper's publication year).
   - Language: English, French.
   - Identifier: Not provided.
   - Theme: Speech Processing, Machine Translation.
   - Keywords: Parallel corpus, English-French, Speech translation.
   - Landing Page: Not provided.
   - Version: 33K.
   - Format: Text, Speech.
   - Task: Word discovery, Machine translation.

2. **EN-FR Corpus (5K)**:
   - Similar to the 33K version but down-sampled to 5,000 utterances.
   - Version: 5K.

3. **MB-FR Corpus**:
   - Creators: Same as above.
   - Description: A corpus of 5,130 sentences from Mboshi aligned to French.
   - Language: Mboshi, French.
   - Version: 5K.

4. **LibriSpeech**:
   - Creators: Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, Sanjeev Khudanpur.
   - Description: A corpus of read English speech, used for training and testing speech recognition systems.
   - Language: English.
   - Version: Not specified in the paper.

Now, I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described with the appropriate metadata.
