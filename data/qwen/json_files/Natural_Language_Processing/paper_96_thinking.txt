Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The paper is about a neural network model for zero-shot learning using multimodal data, specifically focusing on action verbs and video inputs.

Looking at the sections, the "Experiments" section (Section 4) mentions datasets used. Specifically, it references the Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset and the IAPR TC-12 dataset.

For the Kinetics dataset:
- It's cited as [8], which refers to a paper by Kay et al. (2017).
- The dataset consists of 400 human action classes with 10-second videos.
- The creators are the authors of the cited paper: W. Kay, J. Carreira, K. Simonyan, B. Zhang, C. Hillier, S. Vijayanarasimhan, F. Viola, T. Green, T. Back, P. Natsev, M. Suleyman, and A. Zisserman.
- The description is that it's a video dataset with 400 action classes.
- The title is "Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset."
- The year is 2017.
- The format is video.
- The task is action recognition.

For the IAPR TC-12 dataset:
- It's mentioned in the context of using pre-trained features from a GitHub repository.
- The creators are not explicitly mentioned in the paper, but the dataset is known to be created by the IAPR (International Association for Pattern Recognition) TC-12工作组.
- The description is that it's an image dataset with captions.
- The title is "IAPR TC-12 Dataset."
- The year is not specified in the paper, but the dataset is from around 2010.
- The format is image and text.
- The task is image captioning.

I need to structure this information into JSON format using the specified metadata fields. I'll ensure each dataset is a separate object within the array, including all relevant details.
