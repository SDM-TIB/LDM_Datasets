Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses text summarization and mentions the TL;DR challenge, which uses the Reddit corpus. That's one dataset.

Next, in the Related Work section, I see references to the CNN/Daily Mail corpus. This is another dataset used in their experiments.

Looking further into the Experiments section, the authors detail their use of the TL;DR Reddit corpus and the CNN/Daily Mail corpus. They also mention using BERTSUM, but that's a model, not a dataset.

I should check the references for any additional datasets. The references include the Reddit corpus and the CNN/Daily Mail corpus, confirming their use.

Now, I'll extract metadata for each dataset. For the Reddit corpus, the creators are Volkske et al., the title is TL;DR Reddit corpus, description is about summarization, issued in 2017, language is English, and it's used for summarization tasks.

For the CNN/Daily Mail corpus, the creators are Hermann et al., title is CNN/Daily Mail, description about news articles, issued in 2015, language English, and used for summarization.

I'll structure this information into JSON format, ensuring all required fields are included.
