Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper focuses on grammatical error detection (GED) using contextual word representations. It mentions several datasets used for evaluation.

Looking at the "3 Data" section, the datasets are explicitly listed:

1. **First Certificate in English (FCE) dataset**: Annotated essays by non-native learners.
2. **CoNLL 2014 shared task dataset**: Essays by advanced undergraduates at the National University of Singapore.
3. **JFLEG dataset**: Essays by English learners with different first languages and proficiency levels.
4. **BEA 2019 shared task datasets**: Includes the Cambridge English Write & Improve (W&I) corpus and the LOCNESS corpus.

Each of these datasets is used for training and evaluation. I'll need to gather metadata for each, including creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, languages, identifiers, themes, keywords, landing pages, versions, formats, and tasks.

For each dataset, I'll check the references to find the creators and publication years. The descriptions are based on how the paper uses or describes them. Themes and keywords are derived from the context in which the datasets are used. Since the paper doesn't provide DOIs or URLs for these datasets, those fields will be empty.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the specified JSON format, ensuring all required fields are included. If any information isn't available, I'll leave the corresponding field empty.
