Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract. It mentions SNLI and MNLI datasets, which are commonly used in natural language inference tasks. These are key datasets to note.

Moving on to the introduction, the paper discusses adversarial examples and mentions several datasets created by other researchers. For instance, Glockner et al. (2018) created a dataset using WordNet-based single word replacements. Naik et al. (2018) developed a dataset based on manual examination of model mistakes, and McCoy et al. (2019) created a dataset targeting syntactic heuristics.

In the Related Work section, the paper references Gururangan et al. (2018), who identified annotation artifacts in SNLI and MNLI. This indicates that these datasets are central to the research.

Looking at the Models section, the paper uses MNLI for training and evaluation. The Results and Analysis sections delve into performance on various adversarial datasets, including those from Glockner, Naik, and McCoy.

The Fine-Grained Model Comparison and other sections further discuss the use of these datasets to evaluate model robustness and understanding of syntactic phenomena.

Finally, the Conclusion reiterates the importance of these datasets in assessing model capabilities beyond standard benchmarks.

I'll compile all these datasets, ensuring each is described with the required metadata fields based on their usage and descriptions in the paper.
