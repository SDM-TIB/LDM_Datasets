Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper introduces E-BERT, which uses Wikipedia2Vec entity vectors. So, Wikipedia2Vec is definitely a dataset mentioned here.

Next, in the Related Work section, under Wikipedia2Vec, it's described as embedding words and entities into a common space. This confirms that Wikipedia2Vec is a dataset used in the paper.

Moving on to the experiments and results sections, the paper evaluates E-BERT on several tasks. One of these is the LAMA (LAnguage Model Analysis) benchmark, which is used for unsupervised QA. The paper mentions LAMA-Google-RE and LAMA-T-REx, which are subsets of LAMA. So, LAMA is another dataset.

Additionally, the paper discusses the FewRel corpus in the context of relation classification. FewRel is a dataset used for few-shot relation classification, so that's another dataset to include.

Lastly, the paper mentions the AIDA dataset for entity linking. AIDA is a news dataset annotated with Wikipedia URLs, so that's the fourth dataset.

Now, I'll gather metadata for each dataset:

1. **Wikipedia2Vec**: Created by Yamada et al., it's a dataset of word and entity embeddings. The description should reflect its purpose and structure. The title is "Wikipedia2Vec", and it was published in 2016. The landing page is the project's GitHub repository.

2. **LAMA**: Developed by Petroni et al., it's a benchmark for evaluating factual and commonsense knowledge in LMs. The title is "LAMA", published in 2019. The landing page is the official GitHub repository.

3. **FewRel**: Created by Zhang et al., it's a dataset for few-shot relation classification. The title is "FewRel", published in 2019. The landing page is the project's GitHub page.

4. **AIDA**: Compiled by Hoffart et al., it's a dataset for entity linking in news text. The title is "AIDA", published in 2011. The landing page is the official dataset page.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring all information is accurate and sourced from the paper.
