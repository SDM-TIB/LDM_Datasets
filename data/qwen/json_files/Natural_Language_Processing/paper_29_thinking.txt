Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Hierarchical Context Enhanced Multi-Domain Dialogue System for Multi-domain Task Completion" by Jingyuan Yang and others. It's about a dialogue system for tourist information settings, specifically participating in the DSTC8-track1 challenge.

Looking through the abstract, I see they mention the MultiWOZ dataset. That's a key dataset here. The introduction also refers to MultiWOZ, describing it as a large-scale multi-domain dialogue dataset with seven domains related to traveling.

In the related works section, they reference the DSTC8-track1 challenge and the ConvLab platform, which uses the MultiWOZ dataset. The task description section explicitly states that the task is based on the MultiWOZ dataset, which is a large-scale multi-domain dialogue dataset containing seven domains.

The experiments section also discusses the MultiWOZ dataset, providing statistics like the number of dialogues, turns, tokens, etc. They split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The focus is entirely on MultiWOZ for their experiments and evaluations.

Now, I need to extract the metadata for the MultiWOZ dataset using the specified vocabulary.

- **dcterms:creator**: The authors of the MultiWOZ dataset. From the references, the creators are Budzianowski, Wen, Tseng, Casanueva, Ultes, Ramadan, and Gasic.
- **dcterms:description**: The paper describes it as a large-scale multi-domain dialogue dataset with seven domains related to traveling.
- **dcterms:title**: "MultiWOZ"
- **dcterms:issued**: The year the dataset was published, which is 2018.
- **dcterms:language**: The dataset is in English.
- **dcterms:identifier**: The URL from the reference is arXiv:1810.00278.
- **dcat:theme**: Themes include "Dialogue Systems" and "Multi-domain Conversations."
- **dcat:keyword**: Keywords like "multi-domain dialogue," "task-oriented dialogue," "tourist information."
- **dcat:landingPage**: The URL from the reference is arXiv:1810.00278.
- **dcterms:hasVersion**: Not mentioned in the paper.
- **dcterms:format**: The dataset is in text format.
- **mls:task**: Tasks include "Dialogue State Tracking," "Natural Language Understanding," "Natural Language Generation."

I'll structure this information into the required JSON format.
