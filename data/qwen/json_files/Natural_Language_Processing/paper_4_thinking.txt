Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let's start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses a system submitted to the BEA 2019 shared task on grammatical error correction (GEC). It mentions using various corpora for training and evaluation.

Looking at the Corpus section, there's a table listing several datasets:

1. **FCE (First Certificate in English)**
2. **Lang-8**
3. **NUCLE (National University of Singapore Corpus of Learner English)**
4. **W&I+LOCNESS (Write & Improve plus LOCNESS)**

Each of these is a dataset used in the GEC task. The paper also references other datasets in the context of related work, such as the HOO and CoNLL datasets, but these are not explicitly used in the current study.

Now, I'll extract metadata for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **FCE (First Certificate in English)**
   - Creator: The paper cites Yannakoudakis et al. (2011) as the source.
   - Description: A corpus of learner English used for GEC tasks.
   - Title: FCE
   - Issued: 2011
   - Language: English
   - Theme: Language Learning, Grammatical Error Correction
   - Keywords: Learner corpus, GEC
   - Task: Grammatical Error Correction

2. **Lang-8**
   - Creator: Mizumoto et al. (2011)
   - Description: A learner corpus from Lang-8, a language learning platform.
   - Title: Lang-8
   - Issued: 2011
   - Language: English
   - Theme: Language Learning, Grammatical Error Correction
   - Keywords: Learner corpus, GEC
   - Task: Grammatical Error Correction

3. **NUCLE (National University of Singapore Corpus of Learner English)**
   - Creator: Dahlmeier et al. (2013)
   - Description: A corpus of learner English from NUS.
   - Title: NUCLE
   - Issued: 2013
   - Language: English
   - Theme: Language Learning, Grammatical Error Correction
   - Keywords: Learner corpus, GEC
   - Task: Grammatical Error Correction

4. **W&I+LOCNESS (Write & Improve plus LOCNESS)**
   - Creator: Yannakoudakis et al. (2018) and Granger (1998)
   - Description: A combined corpus of learner English from Write & Improve and LOCNESS.
   - Title: W&I+LOCNESS
   - Issued: 2018
   - Language: English
   - Theme: Language Learning, Grammatical Error Correction
   - Keywords: Learner corpus, GEC
   - Task: Grammatical Error Correction

I'll structure each dataset into the required JSON format, ensuring all metadata fields are filled based on the information extracted from the paper.
