Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses enhancing machine translation with a dependency-aware self-attention mechanism. It mentions several datasets used for evaluation.

Looking at the "3.1 Experimental Setup" section, the datasets mentioned are:

1. **News Commentary v11 (NC11)**: Used for En-De and De-En tasks.
2. **WMT16 En-De**: Another dataset for English-German translation.
3. **WMT18 En-Tr**: For English-Turkish translation.
4. **WMT17 En-De**: English-German dataset.
5. **WAT En-Ja**: English-Japanese dataset.

Each of these datasets is used to evaluate the model's performance across different language pairs and resource levels.

I'll need to gather details about each dataset, such as creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, languages, identifiers, themes, keywords, landing pages, versions, formats, and tasks.

For each dataset, I'll check the references in the paper to find creators and other details. If not explicitly mentioned, I'll infer based on the context provided.

Now, I'll structure each dataset according to the metadata fields.
