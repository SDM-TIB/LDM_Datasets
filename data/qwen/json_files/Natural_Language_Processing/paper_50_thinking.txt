Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Attention over Heads: A Multi-Hop Attention for Neural Machine Translation" by Shohei Iida and others. It discusses a new attention mechanism for the Transformer model in neural machine translation tasks.

Looking through the sections, I find that the datasets are mentioned in the "3.1 Data" section. The authors used two datasets:

1. **IWSLT-2017 German-English (IWSLT2017)**: This dataset is from the IWSLT 2017 shared task. It includes training, validation, and test sets with approximately 160K, 7.3K, and 6.7K sentence pairs, respectively.

2. **WMT-2017 German-English (WMT17)**: This is from the WMT17 translation task. It has about 5.9M sentence pairs in the training set, with newstest2013 as the validation set and newstest2014 and newstest2017 as test sets.

I need to gather metadata for each dataset. 

For IWSLT2017:
- **Creators**: The dataset is created by the IWSLT organizers, but the paper doesn't specify individual creators. So, I'll leave it as an empty list.
- **Description**: German-English parallel data from IWSLT2017 with specific sentence pair counts.
- **Title**: IWSLT-2017 German-English
- **Issued**: 2017
- **Language**: German and English
- **Identifier**: No DOI or URL provided in the paper.
- **Theme**: Machine Translation, Neural Machine Translation
- **Keywords**: IWSLT, German-English, parallel data
- **Landing Page**: No URL provided.
- **Version**: Not mentioned.
- **Format**: Text
- **Task**: Neural Machine Translation

For WMT17:
- **Creators**: Similarly, the creators aren't specified in the paper.
- **Description**: German-English parallel data from WMT17 with specific training and test sets.
- **Title**: WMT-2017 German-English
- **Issued**: 2017
- **Language**: German and English
- **Identifier**: No DOI or URL provided.
- **Theme**: Machine Translation, Neural Machine Translation
- **Keywords**: WMT, German-English, parallel data
- **Landing Page**: No URL provided.
- **Version**: Not mentioned.
- **Format**: Text
- **Task**: Neural Machine Translation

I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring each dataset is accurately described based on the paper's details.
