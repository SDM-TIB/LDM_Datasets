Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the given research paper. The paper is about fine-tuning BERT for joint entity and relation extraction in Chinese medical text. The authors mention datasets they used for their experiments, so I need to identify those.

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on coronary angiography texts collected from Shuguang Hospital. That's one dataset.

Next, I'll look into the Methodology section. They describe their model and experiments but don't mention other datasets beyond the one from Shuguang Hospital.

In the Experimental Studies section, they provide more details about their dataset. It's collected from coronary arteriography reports in Shanghai Shuguang Hospital. They mention five types of entities and six relations. They split the dataset into training, development, and test sets in an 8:1:1 ratio.

I don't see any other datasets mentioned in the paper. They only refer to their own dataset collected from Shuguang Hospital. So, the only dataset to extract is this one.

Now, I'll structure the metadata based on the information provided. The creators are the authors of the paper, but since the dataset is their own, I'll list them as creators. The description is based on their usage and description in the paper. The title is the name of the dataset. The issued year isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll leave it empty. The language is Chinese since it's medical text in Chinese. The identifier isn't provided, so it's empty. The theme is medical text analysis. Keywords include entity extraction, relation extraction, etc. The landing page isn't provided. The format is text. The task is joint entity and relation extraction.

I need to make sure all fields are correctly filled based on the paper's information.
