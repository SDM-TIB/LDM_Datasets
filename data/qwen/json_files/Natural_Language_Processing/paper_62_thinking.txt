Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, the paper is about hate speech detection on Twitter, specifically targeting immigrants and women. It mentions participation in SemEval-2019 Task 5. The authors describe their system, which uses an ensemble of attention-LSTM and BiGRU-capsule models. They mention using fastText pre-trained embeddings.

Looking through the paper, I see references to the training, development, and test datasets provided by the SemEval-2019 Task 5 organizers. These datasets are used for both Subtask A (hate speech detection) and Subtask B (aggressive behavior and target classification). The paper doesn't cite external datasets beyond these, so the main dataset is from SemEval-2019 Task 5.

I need to gather metadata for this dataset. The creators are the organizers of SemEval-2019 Task 5, which includes authors like Valerio Basile, Cristina Bosco, etc. The description mentions tweets in English and Spanish, focusing on hate speech against immigrants and women. The dataset includes training, development, and test sets with labels for hate speech, aggressiveness, and target type.

The title is "SemEval-2019 Task 5: Multilingual Detection of Hate Speech against Immigrants and Women in Twitter." It was issued in 2019. The language is English and Spanish. The format is text, and the tasks include hate speech detection and classification.

I'll structure this information into the required JSON format, ensuring all fields are filled appropriately based on the paper's description.
