Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, the paper is titled "QE BERT: Bilingual BERT using Multi-task Learning for Neural Quality Estimation" by Hyun Kim and others. It's about using BERT for translation quality estimation.

Looking through the abstract, I don't see any datasets mentioned. The introduction talks about translation quality estimation and mentions some previous work, but no specific datasets.

In the methodology section, under "2 QE BERT," the authors discuss pre-training and fine-tuning. They mention using parallel data from the WMT19 news machine translation task. Specifically, they reference English-Russian and English-German parallel data sets. These datasets include various corpora like ParaCrawl, Common Crawl, News Commentary, Yandex, Europarl, and Document-split Rapid.

The experiments section (3.1) mentions evaluating on the WMT19 QE Shared Task datasets for English-Russian and English-German. These are the datasets used for testing their model.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. WMT19 QE Shared Task datasets (English-Russian and English-German)
2. WMT19 news machine translation task datasets (including various sub-corpora)

I need to extract metadata for each of these datasets. However, the paper doesn't provide detailed metadata like creators, descriptions, or URLs for these datasets. Therefore, I'll note that the datasets are mentioned but without specific metadata.
