Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about applying scheduled sampling to Transformer models for machine translation tasks. 

First, I'll go through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned. I'll start by reading the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The abstract mentions experiments on two language pairs, but it doesn't specify the datasets yet.

Moving on to the introduction, I see that the paper discusses machine translation tasks, which often use specific datasets. The methods section might provide more details. 

Looking at the experiments section, I find that the authors tested their models on two language pairs: German-English (DE-EN) and Japanese-English (JA-EN). They reference the IWSLT 2017 dataset for DE-EN and the KFTT dataset for JA-EN. 

I need to extract metadata for each dataset. For IWSLT 2017 DE-EN, the creators are Cettolo et al., the description is about the dataset's use in machine translation, the title is "IWSLT 2017 German-English", published in 2017, language is German and English, and it's used for translation tasks. 

For KFTT Japanese-English, the creator is Neubig, the description is about its use in translation, the title is "KFTT Japanese-English", published in 2011, languages are Japanese and English, and it's also used for translation tasks.

I'll structure this information into JSON format, ensuring each dataset has the required metadata fields.
