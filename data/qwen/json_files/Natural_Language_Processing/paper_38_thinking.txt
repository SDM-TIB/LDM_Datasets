Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Alternative Weighting Schemes for ELMo Embeddings" by Nils Reimers and Iryna Gurevych. It discusses the use of ELMo embeddings in various NLP tasks and evaluates different weighting schemes for combining the layers of the biLM model.

Looking through the sections, I notice that the datasets are mentioned in the "4 Evaluation of Weighting Schemes" section. The authors describe two experiments: one using a BiLSTM-CRF architecture and another using AllenNLP models. The datasets used in these experiments are listed as follows:

1. **ACE Entities and ACE Events**: These are parts of the ACE 2005 dataset, which is used for entity and event detection.
2. **POS**: This refers to the part-of-speech tagging dataset from Universal Dependencies v. 1.3 for English.
3. **Chunking**: The CoNLL 2000 shared task dataset on chunking.
4. **NER**: The CoNLL 2003 shared task on named entity recognition.
5. **GENIA NER**: The Bio-Entity Recognition Task at JNLPBA, which involves annotating bio-entities in Medline abstracts.
6. **WNUT16**: The WNUT16 shared task on Named Entity Recognition over Twitter.

Additionally, the AllenNLP experiments use the following datasets:

1. **CoNLL 2003 NER model**: This is the same as the NER dataset mentioned earlier.
2. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-5)**: A dataset for sentiment analysis.
3. **Penn TreeBank**: Used for constituency parsing.
4. **Stanford Natural Language Inference Corpus (SNLI)**: A dataset for natural language inference.

Now, I need to gather metadata for each of these datasets. I'll look for the creators, descriptions, titles, publication years, languages, identifiers, themes, keywords, landing pages, versions, formats, and tasks associated with each dataset.

For example, the ACE 2005 dataset was created by Walker et al. in 2005. It's used for entity and event detection in various domains. The language is English, and it's a text dataset. The task is named entity recognition and event detection.

Similarly, the CoNLL 2003 NER dataset is used for named entity recognition, and the creators are the CoNLL organizers. The language is English, and the task is NER.

I'll continue this process for each dataset mentioned, ensuring that I capture all relevant metadata accurately.
