Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me go through the paper step by step.

First, I'll read the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper introduces Text2Node, a system for mapping medical phrases to a taxonomy. It mentions using SNOMED CT as the target taxonomy and discusses word embeddings trained on a biomedical corpus.

Looking into the Methods section, under Word Embeddings, the authors constructed a corpus from several sources: PubMed, MIMIC-III Clinical Database, FDA's FAERS, and the 2010 i2b2 Relations Challenge. They also mention using SNOMED CT as their target taxonomy.

In the Evaluation section, they tested their system on ICD-9-CM phrases mapped to SNOMED CT concepts. They reference a dataset from [32], which is the ICD-9-CM to SNOMED CT mapping.

Now, I'll identify each dataset:

1. **PubMed**: A large repository of biomedical articles. The authors used it to train their word embeddings.
2. **MIMIC-III Clinical Database**: A dataset containing clinical data from patients, used for training word embeddings.
3. **FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)**: A dataset of adverse drug events, used for training.
4. **2010 i2b2 Relations Challenge**: A dataset used for training word embeddings.
5. **SNOMED CT**: The target taxonomy used for mapping.
6. **ICD-9-CM to SNOMED CT Mapping**: A dataset from reference [32], used for evaluation.

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata. Some details like creators and identifiers aren't explicitly provided, so I'll leave those fields empty where necessary.
