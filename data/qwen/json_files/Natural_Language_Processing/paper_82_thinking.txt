Alright, I need to extract all datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper introduces the DIET architecture and mentions datasets used in their experiments. Moving to the "4.1 Datasets" section, I find three datasets: NLU-Benchmark, ATIS, and SNIPS.

For each dataset, I'll extract the required metadata fields:

1. **NLU-Benchmark Dataset**:
   - **Creator**: The authors are not explicitly mentioned, but the dataset is cited as (Liu et al., 2019b).
   - **Description**: It's a complex multi-domain dataset with utterances covering various tasks.
   - **Title**: NLU-Benchmark.
   - **Issued**: 2019.
   - **Language**: English.
   - **Identifier**: URL provided.
   - **Theme**: Natural Language Understanding, Dialogue Systems.
   - **Keywords**: Intent classification, Entity recognition.
   - **Landing Page**: URL.
   - **Version**: Not mentioned.
   - **Format**: Text.
   - **Task**: Intent classification, Entity recognition.

2. **ATIS Dataset**:
   - **Creator**: Hemphill et al., 1990.
   - **Description**: Contains transcripts of flight reservation requests.
   - **Title**: ATIS.
   - **Issued**: 1990.
   - **Language**: English.
   - **Identifier**: URL.
   - **Theme**: Natural Language Understanding.
   - **Keywords**: Intent classification, Entity recognition.
   - **Landing Page**: URL.
   - **Version**: Not mentioned.
   - **Format**: Text.
   - **Task**: Intent classification, Entity recognition.

3. **SNIPS Dataset**:
   - **Creator**: Coucke et al., 2018.
   - **Description**: Collected from a personal voice assistant.
   - **Title**: SNIPS.
   - **Issued**: 2018.
   - **Language**: English.
   - **Identifier**: URL.
   - **Theme**: Natural Language Understanding.
   - **Keywords**: Intent classification, Entity recognition.
   - **Landing Page**: URL.
   - **Version**: Not mentioned.
   - **Format**: Text.
   - **Task**: Intent classification, Entity recognition.

I'll ensure each dataset is accurately described based on the paper's information and format them into JSON as required.
