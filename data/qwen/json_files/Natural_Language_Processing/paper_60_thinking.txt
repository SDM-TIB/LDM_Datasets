Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "HLT@SUDA at SemEval 2019 Task 1: UCCA Graph Parsing as Constituent Tree Parsing" by Wei Jiang, Zhenghua Li, Yu Zhang, and Min Zhang. It's about UCCA graph parsing and their approach to converting UCCA graphs into constituent trees.

Looking through the abstract, they mention using the multilingual BERT as extra features in the open tracks. So, BERT is a dataset or model they used.

In the introduction, they reference the UCCA framework and mention the SemEval 2019 Task 1, which involves parsing UCCA graphs. They also cite Hershcovich et al. (2017) for their UCCA parser, which might be a dataset.

In the methods section, they discuss using the multilingual BERT model, which is a pre-trained model but can be considered a dataset in terms of the data it's trained on. They also mention the English-Wiki and German data, which are likely datasets used for training and evaluation.

In the experiments section, they refer to the English-Wiki and German datasets, and also mention the French data for cross-lingual parsing. These are all datasets used in their work.

Looking at the references, they cite several papers, but the datasets mentioned are UCCA, English-Wiki, German, and French datasets, as well as the multilingual BERT model.

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. UCCA (Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation)
2. English-Wiki
3. German
4. French
5. Multilingual BERT

Now, I'll extract the metadata for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper.
