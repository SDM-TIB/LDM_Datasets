Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let's start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or mentioned.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper discusses a neural architecture called LTMI for visual dialog tasks. It mentions using the VisDial dataset, specifically versions v1.0 and v0.9. Additionally, it references the Audio Visual Scene-aware Dialog Dataset (AVSD) in the supplementary material.

Next, I'll look into the sections where datasets are described in detail. The paper uses VisDial v1.0 for experiments, which includes images, dialog histories, and candidate answers. It also mentions VisDial v0.9, which is an earlier version. The AVSD dataset is mentioned in the supplementary material, focusing on audio-visual dialog tasks.

Now, I'll gather the necessary metadata for each dataset. For VisDial v1.0 and v0.9, the creators are the authors of the VisDial paper. The description includes details about the dataset's structure and usage. The title is straightforward, and the issued year is when the dataset was published. The language is English, and the format is a mix of images and text. The themes and keywords are based on the dataset's content and application.

For AVSD, the creators are the authors of the AVSD paper. The description focuses on audio-visual dialog, and the format includes audio and video features. The themes and keywords reflect its use in dialog tasks.

I'll ensure each dataset entry is accurate and follows the specified JSON structure, including all relevant metadata fields. I'll avoid including any datasets not explicitly mentioned in the paper and ensure that the creators are correctly identified based on the references provided.
