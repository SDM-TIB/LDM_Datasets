Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is titled "XQA: A Cross-lingual Open-domain Question Answering Dataset" by Jiahua Liu, Yankai Lin, Zhiyuan Liu, and Maosong Sun. 

First, I'll read through the abstract to get an overview. The abstract mentions the creation of a new dataset called XQA, which is designed for cross-lingual open-domain question answering. It consists of a training set in English and development and test sets in eight other languages. The dataset is publicly available on GitHub.

Next, I'll look into the introduction to understand the context. The authors discuss the need for cross-lingual OpenQA due to the lack of labeled data in low-resource languages. They mention that XQA is their novel dataset, which includes questions and answers in multiple languages, along with relevant documents.

In the sections following the introduction, the authors describe the construction of the XQA dataset. They mention collecting questions from Wikipedia's "Did you know" sections in various languages and using WikiData for answer extraction. The dataset includes questions in English, Chinese, French, German, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Tamil, and Ukrainian.

The authors also discuss the baseline systems they built using publicly available corpora, but these are not datasets themselves. They mention using multilingual BERT, which is a model, not a dataset.

Looking at the references, I don't see any other datasets mentioned beyond XQA. The paper focuses on their own dataset and the experiments conducted on it.

So, the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper is XQA. It's described in detail, including its structure, languages covered, and availability on GitHub.
