Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to extract datasets from the provided research paper. The paper is about using BERT for evidence retrieval and claim verification in the FEVER challenge. 

First, I'll read through the abstract and introduction to understand the context. The paper mentions the FEVER dataset, which is used for claim verification. I need to identify if there are any other datasets mentioned besides FEVER.

Looking through the introduction, the authors reference the FEVER benchmark, which consists of 185K claims labeled as SUPPORTED, REFUTED, or NOT ENOUGH INFO. They also mention that the dataset is based on Wikipedia pages. 

In the related work section, they discuss other datasets like MS MARCO and MultiNLI, which are used for passage re-ranking and natural language inference, respectively. These datasets are relevant because they are used in similar tasks as FEVER.

The methods section talks about using BERT models for retrieval and verification, but doesn't mention any new datasets. The results section again focuses on FEVER, so no new datasets are introduced there.

In the references, I see citations for FEVER, MS MARCO, and MultiNLI. These are the datasets used in the paper. 

So, the datasets mentioned are:
1. FEVER
2. MS MARCO
3. MultiNLI

Each of these datasets is used for different tasks related to evidence retrieval and claim verification. FEVER is the primary dataset for the challenge, while MS MARCO and MultiNLI are used for related tasks like passage re-ranking and natural language inference.
