Alright, I'm trying to extract the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me go through the paper step by step to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll read the abstract. It mentions introducing linguistic factors into the Transformer model for low-resource machine translation. The experiments are conducted on two datasets: IWSLT German-to-English and FLoRes English-to-Nepali. So, these are two datasets I need to note.

Moving on to the introduction, the authors reference several works that used different datasets, but I don't see any additional datasets mentioned beyond the ones in the abstract.

In the section describing the experimental framework, the authors detail their experiments. They mention using the IWSLT14 dataset for German-to-English translation, which is a low-resource dataset with about 160,000 sentences. They also mention the FLoRes benchmark for English-to-Nepali, which is described as extremely low-resource and challenging due to the language pair's dissimilarity.

Looking at the references, I find citations for the IWSLT and FLoRes datasets. The IWSLT14 dataset is cited by Cettolo et al. (2014), and FLoRes is cited by Guzmán et al. (2019). These references provide the creators, titles, and publication years for each dataset.

I don't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors only reference these two datasets in their experiments and analysis.

Now, I'll structure the metadata for each dataset based on the information extracted.

For the IWSLT German-English dataset:
- Creators: Cettolo, Niehues, Stüker, Bentivogli, Federico
- Description: Low-resource dataset with 160,000 sentences, used for machine translation evaluation.
- Title: IWSLT German-English
- Issued: 2014
- Language: German, English
- Theme: Machine Translation, Low-Resource
- Keywords: Machine translation, Low-resource, German, English
- Tasks: Machine Translation

For the FLoRes English-Nepali dataset:
- Creators: Guzmán, Chen, Ott, Pino, Lample, Koehn, Chaudhary, Ranzato
- Description: Extremely low-resource dataset with 564,000 sentences, used for challenging machine translation tasks.
- Title: FLoRes English-Nepali
- Issued: 2019
- Language: English, Nepali
- Theme: Machine Translation, Low-Resource
- Keywords: Machine translation, Low-resource, English, Nepali
- Tasks: Machine Translation

I've ensured that each dataset's metadata is accurately extracted from the paper, focusing on the details provided by the authors.
