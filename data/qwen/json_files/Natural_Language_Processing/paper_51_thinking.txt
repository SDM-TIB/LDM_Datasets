Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

The paper is titled "Adversarial Learning with Contextual Embeddings for Zero-resource Cross-lingual Classification and NER" by Phillip Keung, Yichao Lu, and Vikas Bhardwaj. It discusses using multilingual BERT for zero-resource cross-lingual tasks and mentions several datasets.

First, I'll look through the abstract and introduction. The abstract mentions the multilingual version of BERT and the XNLI dataset. The introduction also references XNLI and mentions MLDoc and CoNLL 2002/2003 NER tasks.

Moving to the experiments section, the authors detail their use of MLDoc for text classification and CoNLL 2002/2003 for NER. They also reference other datasets like Reuters RCV1/RCV2, which is part of MLDoc.

In the references, I find citations for MLDoc (Schwenk and Li, 2018) and CoNLL (Sang and De Meulder, 2003). XNLI is cited as well (Conneau et al., 2018).

Now, I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata:

1. **MLDoc**: Created by Schwenk and Li, it's a multilingual document classification dataset with 4 classes. Published in 2018, it's in multiple languages and used for classification tasks.

2. **CoNLL 2002/2003**: Created by Sang and De Meulder, it's for NER tasks in multiple languages. Published in 2003, it's used for named entity recognition.

3. **XNLI**: Created by Conneau et al., it's for cross-lingual sentence classification. Published in 2018, it's used for evaluating cross-lingual embeddings.

I'll ensure each dataset includes all the required fields, even if some are empty where information isn't available.
