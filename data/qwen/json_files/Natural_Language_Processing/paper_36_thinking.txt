Alright, I need to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets used or referenced.

First, I'll look at the abstract and introduction to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract mentions the Natural Questions dataset, which is a well-known dataset in the field of question answering. 

Next, I'll go through the introduction and other sections to find any other datasets. The paper discusses experiments and evaluations, so I'll check if they reference any specific datasets beyond Natural Questions. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I notice that the authors primarily use the Natural Questions dataset for their experiments. They don't mention any other datasets in the context of their research. 

Now, I'll gather the metadata for the Natural Questions dataset. The creators are listed in the references as Kwiatkowski et al., 2019. The description is based on how the authors used it in their paper, which involves question answering tasks. The title is "Natural Questions," and it was published in 2019. The language is English, and it's related to natural language processing tasks. 

I won't find any other datasets mentioned in the paper, so the only dataset to include is Natural Questions.
