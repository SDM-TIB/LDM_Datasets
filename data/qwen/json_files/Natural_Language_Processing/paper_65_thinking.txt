Alright, I need to extract all the datasets mentioned in the provided research paper and describe each using the specified metadata vocabulary. Let me start by carefully reading through the paper to identify any datasets.

First, I'll go through the abstract and introduction to get an overview. The paper introduces LXMERT, a framework for vision-and-language tasks. It mentions datasets used for pre-training and evaluation.

Looking at the sections, I see references to several datasets:

1. **VQA (Visual Question Answering)**: Mentioned in the evaluation section. It's a dataset where models answer questions about images.

2. **GQA (Guess What?)**: Another dataset for visual question answering, more complex than VQA.

3. **NLVR2 (Natural Language for Visual Reasoning)**: A dataset where models determine if a statement about two images is true.

4. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: Used for image captioning and pre-training.

5. **Visual Genome**: A dataset with detailed image annotations used for pre-training.

6. **VG-QA**: A subset of Visual Genome for question answering.

Now, I'll extract metadata for each dataset based on the paper's description.

- **VQA**: Created by Antol et al., used for visual question answering. The paper mentions VQA v2.0, which has improved question distribution.

- **GQA**: Created by Hudson and Manning, focuses on compositional reasoning.

- **NLVR2**: Created by Suhr et al., evaluates visual reasoning with two images and a statement.

- **COCO**: Created by Lin et al., contains images with captions and object annotations.

- **Visual Genome**: Created by Krishna et al., includes detailed annotations and relationships.

- **VG-QA**: Part of Visual Genome, used for question answering tasks.

I'll structure each dataset with the required metadata fields, ensuring accuracy based on the paper's descriptions.
