Alright, I'm trying to extract datasets mentioned in the provided research paper. The paper is about PoWER-BERT, a method to improve BERT's inference time by eliminating redundant word-vectors. The authors mention several datasets they used for their experiments.

First, I'll look through the paper to identify any datasets. In the abstract, they mention the GLUE benchmark and the SQuAD dataset. GLUE is a collection of tasks for natural language understanding, and SQuAD is a question-answering dataset.

In the introduction, they reference the GLUE benchmark again and mention the SST-2 dataset, which is part of GLUE and focuses on sentiment analysis. They also mention the IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis and the RACE dataset for reading comprehension.

Looking further into the experimental section, they detail their evaluation on nine datasets from GLUE, including CoLA, RTE, MRPC, QQP, QNLI, MNLI, STS-B, and others. They also mention the IMDB and RACE datasets.

I need to structure each dataset with the required metadata. For each dataset, I'll extract the creator, description, title, publication year, language, identifier, theme, keywords, landing page, version, format, and tasks.

For example, GLUE is a collection, so its creator would be the authors who developed it, like Wang et al. The description would be about the various NLP tasks it includes. The title is "GLUE Benchmark," and the year is 2019. The language is English, and the format is text.

Similarly, SQuAD is a question-answering dataset created by Rajpurkar et al. in 2016. It's used for evaluating reading comprehension.

I'll go through each dataset mentioned, gather the necessary information, and structure them into JSON format as required.
