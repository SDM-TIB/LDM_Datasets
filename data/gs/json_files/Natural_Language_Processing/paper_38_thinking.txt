To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Alternative Weighting Schemes for ELMo Embeddings" by Nils Reimers and Iryna Gurevych, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of different methods for combining ELMo vectors, which suggests that datasets are involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In the text, they mention several datasets for different NLP tasks, including:

1. **Arguments**: This dataset is used for argument component detection in persuasive essays, specifically 402 essays. The authors reference Stab and Gurevych (2017) for this dataset.

2. **ACE Entities/Events**: This dataset is from the ACE 2005 corpus, which consists of 599 annotated documents across various domains. The citation for this dataset is Walker et al. (2005).

3. **POS**: The authors mention using part-of-speech tags from Universal Dependencies v. 1.3, but they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset.

4. **Chunking**: They refer to the CoNLL 2000 shared task dataset for chunking, but again, no specific citation is provided.

5. **NER**: The CoNLL 2003 shared task dataset is used for named entity recognition, which also lacks a specific citation in the text.

6. **GENIA NER**: This dataset is used for bio-entity recognition and is based on the work by Kim et al. (2004).

7. **WNUT16**: This dataset is from the WNUT16 shared task on Named Entity Recognition over Twitter, with a citation for Strauss et al. (2016).

8. **SST**: The Stanford Sentiment Treebank is mentioned, but no citation is provided.

9. **Parsing**: The authors refer to the Penn TreeBank for parsing tasks, but again, no citation is provided.

10. **SNLI**: The Stanford Natural Language Inference Corpus is mentioned, but no citation is provided.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for those that are mentioned. The citations I will extract include:

- For **Arguments**:

- For **GENIA NER**:

- For **WNUT16**:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
