To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TMU Transformer System Using BERT for Re-ranking at BEA 2019" by Masahiro Kaneko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the BEA 2019 shared task on grammatical error correction, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They present a table (Table 1) that lists the datasets along with the number of sentences in each corpus. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **FCE (First Certificate in English)**: This dataset contains 28,350 training sentences, 2,191 development sentences, and 2,695 test sentences.
2. **Lang-8**: This dataset has 1,037,561 training sentences, with no specified development or test splits.
3. **NUCLE (National University of Singapore Corpus of Learner English)**: This dataset includes 57,151 training sentences, with no development or test splits mentioned.
4. **W&I+LOCNESS**: This dataset has 34,308 training sentences, 4,384 development sentences, and 4,477 test sentences.

I will then look for the **full citations** for each dataset in the **References section** of the paper. The citations I find are:

- For **FCE**:
  > Yannakoudakis, H., Briscoe, T., & Medlock, B. (2011). A New Dataset and Method for Automatically Grading ESOL Texts. In NAACL, pages 180–189, Portland, Oregon, USA. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **Lang-8**:
  > Mizumoto, T., Komachi, M., Nagata, M., & Matsumoto, Y. (2011). Mining Revision Log of Language Learning SNS for Automated Japanese Error Correction of Second Language Learners. In IJCNLP, pages 147–155, Chiang Mai, Thailand. Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing.

- For **NUCLE**:
  > Dahlmeier, D., Ng, H. T., & Wu, S. M. (2013). Building a Large Annotated Corpus of Learner English: The NUS Corpus of Learner English. In BEA, pages 22–31, Atlanta, Georgia. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **W&I+LOCNESS**:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its corresponding citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
