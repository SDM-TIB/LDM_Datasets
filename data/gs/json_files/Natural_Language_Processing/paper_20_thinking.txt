To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Question Generation from Paragraphs: A Tale of Two Hierarchical Models" by Vishwajeet Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting empirical evaluations on the **SQuAD** and **MS MARCO** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are likely central to their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)**: This dataset consists of 536 Wikipedia articles and over 100,000 questions posed about these articles by crowd-workers. The authors note that they split the SQuAD train set into a training and development set for evaluation purposes.

2. **MS MARCO (Microsoft MAchine Reading COmprehension)**: This dataset contains passages retrieved from web documents, with questions that are anonymized versions of Bing queries. The authors specify that they used a subset of the MS MARCO v1.1 dataset that includes questions answerable from at least one paragraph.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to obtain the full citations for each dataset:

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383â€“2392, 2016.

- For **MS MARCO**, the citation is:
  > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.09268, 2016.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this data into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
