To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Insertion-Deletion Transformer" by Laura Ruis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed model and its applications, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), as this is where datasets are typically discussed in detail. In this section, the authors mention that they demonstrate their model on **synthetic translation datasets**. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Upon reviewing Section 3, I find that the authors describe two specific tasks for which they generated synthetic datasets:

1. **Shifting Alphabetic Sequences**: The authors explain that they generated 1000 examples for training and evaluated on 100 held-out examples. However, they do not provide a formal dataset name or citation, as this is a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of their experiments.

2. **Caesar’s Cipher**: Similarly, they generated 100,000 examples for training and evaluated on 1000 held-out examples. Again, this is a synthetic dataset, and no formal citation is provided.

Since both datasets are synthetic and created by the authors for their experiments, they do not have external citations. However, I will still note their descriptions and the context in which they were used.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any datasets mentioned that might have been used in prior work or as benchmarks. However, the references primarily cite related works and do not mention any specific datasets that were used in this paper.

In conclusion, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:

1. **Shifting Alphabetic Sequences**: A synthetic dataset generated for training and evaluation, consisting of sequences of varying lengths.
2. **Caesar’s Cipher**: Another synthetic dataset created for the purpose of the experiments, involving sequences generated based on the Caesar cipher method.

Since these datasets are not formally cited in the literature, I will note that they are synthetic datasets created by the authors for their specific experiments.

Now, I will compile the information regarding these datasets into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
