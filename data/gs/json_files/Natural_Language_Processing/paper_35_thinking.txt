To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Multilingual Culture-Independent Word Analogy Datasets" by Matej Ulƒçar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a collection of datasets for the word analogy task in nine languages, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant subsections that detail the datasets used. In this paper, the authors describe the creation of monolingual and cross-lingual datasets in **Section 3 (Creation of datasets)**. Here, they mention that they composed analogy tasks for nine languages, which implies that there are distinct datasets for each language.

In **Section 4.1 (Statistics)**, the authors provide statistics about the constructed monolingual datasets, indicating the number of analogy pairs for each language. They mention the following languages and their respective dataset sizes:

1. **Croatian**: 19,416 pairs
2. **English**: 18,530 pairs
3. **Estonian**: 18,372 pairs
4. **Finnish**: 19,462 pairs
5. **Latvian**: 20,138 pairs
6. **Lithuanian**: 20,022 pairs
7. **Russian**: 19,976 pairs
8. **Slovene**: 19,918 pairs
9. **Swedish**: 18,480 pairs

Additionally, the authors mention that they created cross-lingual datasets for all 72 language pairs, but specific sizes for these datasets are provided for a few selected pairs in **Table 4**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are original contributions of the authors. However, the authors reference the foundational work by Mikolov et al. (2013a) for the English dataset, which serves as a basis for their multilingual datasets.

The relevant citation for the foundational dataset is:
- Mikolov, T., Chen, K., Corrado, G., & Dean, J. (2013a). Efficient estimation of word representations in vector space. arXiv preprint 1301.3781.

Since the datasets are original and created by the authors, I will note that the datasets themselves do not have separate citations but are derived from the methodology described in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the relevant details and the foundational citation for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets presented in the research.
