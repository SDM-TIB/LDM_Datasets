To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empirical Evaluation of Sequence-to-Sequence Models for Word Discovery in Low-resource Settings" by Marcely Zanon Boito et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper evaluates sequence-to-sequence models for word discovery in low-resource settings, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental settings** section, particularly **section 2.2 (Parallel Speech Corpora)**, where the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **English-French (EN-FR) Corpus**: This dataset consists of 33,192 sentences and is a multilingual extension from Librispeech, containing English audio books aligned with French translations.

2. **Mboshi-French (MB-FR) Corpus**: This dataset contains 5,130 sentences from the language documentation process of Mboshi, an endangered language spoken in Congo-Brazzaville.

I will also check the **tables** within the paper, specifically **Table 1**, which provides statistics about the datasets, confirming their sizes and characteristics.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **English-French (EN-FR) Corpus**, the citation is:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP 2015, pages 5206–5210, 2015. [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178964

- For the **Mboshi-French (MB-FR) Corpus**, the citation is:
  > P. Godard, G. Adda, M. Adda-Decker, J. Benjumea, L. Besacier, J. Cooper-Leavitt, G.-N. Kouarata, L. Lamel, H. Maynard, M. Müller et al. *A very low resource language speech corpus for computational language documentation experiments*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.03501, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
