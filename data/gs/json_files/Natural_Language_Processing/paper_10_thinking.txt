To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Patent Landscaping Model Using the Transformer and Graph Embedding" by Seokkyu Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce **four benchmark datasets** for patent landscaping, which suggests that I should look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (KISTA datasets for patent landscaping)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets. They mention that the datasets are constructed based on KISTA patent trend reports and are derived from Google BigQuery. The four datasets listed are:

1. **MPUART (Marine Plant Using Augmented Reality Technology)**: This dataset includes patents related to augmented reality technology in marine applications.

2. **1MWDFS (Technology for 1MW Dual Frequency System)**: This dataset focuses on patents related to dual frequency systems.

3. **MRRG (Technology for Micro Radar Rain Gauge)**: This dataset contains patents associated with micro radar technology for measuring precipitation.

4. **GOCS (Technology for Geostationary Orbit Complex Satellite)**: This dataset pertains to patents related to geostationary satellites.

In **section 3.3 (Dataset description)**, the authors provide additional details about the number of patents and valid patents for each dataset, which is crucial for understanding their scope and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The authors reference the KISTA patent trend reports as the source for their datasets, but they do not provide specific citations for each dataset since they are derived from a common source. However, I can cite the KISTA reports as follows:

- **KISTA Patent Trend Reports**: Korean Intellectual Property Strategy Agency (KISTA). Available at: http://biz.kista.re.kr/patentmap/

With this information, I can summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **MPUART**: A dataset focused on augmented reality technology in marine applications, derived from KISTA reports.
2. **1MWDFS**: A dataset related to dual frequency systems, also derived from KISTA reports.
3. **MRRG**: A dataset concerning micro radar technology for precipitation measurement, sourced from KISTA reports.
4. **GOCS**: A dataset related to geostationary satellites, obtained from KISTA reports.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the KISTA reports as the source for all datasets. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
