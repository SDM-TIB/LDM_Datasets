To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CRAM: Clued Recurrent Attention Model" by Minki Chung and Sungzoon Cho, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed model on two computer vision tasks: image classification and inpainting, but does not specify datasets yet.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this case, I will focus on the **Image Inpainting** section, which explicitly mentions the **Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset**. The authors provide a brief description of this dataset, stating that it contains real-world images of house numbers obtained from Google Street View, with a total of 73,257 training digits and 26,032 testing digits, each sized 32x32 in RGB color scale.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SVHN dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu, and A. Y. Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, vol. 2011, no. 2, 2011, p. 5.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the SVHN dataset for the inpainting task, I will note this as the only dataset extracted from this research paper.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. This will allow for easy reference and further analysis of the datasets used in the study.
