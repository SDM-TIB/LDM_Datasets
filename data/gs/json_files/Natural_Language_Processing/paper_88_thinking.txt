To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Captioning through Image Transformer" by Sen He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on the **MSCOCO image captioning dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to their work.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss their experimental setup. In **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, they explicitly mention that their model is trained on the **MSCOCO image captioning dataset**. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of images in the training, validation, and test sets, as well as the number of captions per image.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MSCOCO dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **MSCOCO Dataset**:
  > Chen, X., Fang, H., Lin, T.Y., Vedantam, R., Gupta, S., Doll√°r, P., Zitnick, C.L. (2015). *Microsoft coco captions: Data collection and evaluation server*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00325.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MSCOCO dataset for its experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, ready for downstream processing or review.
