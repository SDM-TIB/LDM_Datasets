To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Local Neighboring Structure for Robust 3D Shape Representation" by Zhongpai Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets to identify.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they evaluated their model on two datasets: **COMA** and **DFAUST**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset.

1. **COMA Dataset**: The paper describes this dataset as consisting of 12 classes of extreme facial expressions from 12 different subjects, containing a total of 20,466 3D meshes registered to a common reference template with 5023 vertices.

2. **DFAUST Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing over 40,000 real meshes capturing 129 dynamic performances from 10 subjects. The meshes are registered to a common reference topology with 6890 vertices.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **COMA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ranjan, A., Bolkart, T., Sanyal, S., & Black, M. J. (2018). Generating 3D Faces using Convolutional Mesh Autoencoders. In The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

- For the **DFAUST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bogo, F., Romero, J., Loper, M., & Black, M. J. (2017). Dynamic FAUST: Registering Human Bodies in Motion. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
