To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning in Biomedical Named Entity Recognition: An Evaluation of BERT in the PharmaCoNER task" by Cong Sun and Zhihao Yang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper evaluates the PharmaCoNER task, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the PharmaCoNER dataset, which is the first Named Entity Recognition (NER) task focused on recognizing chemical and protein entities from Spanish biomedical texts. This is a clear indication that the PharmaCoNER dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Results and Discussion)**, where the authors provide details about the PharmaCoNER corpus. They specify that this corpus has been divided into three subsets: a training set containing 500 clinical cases, and both a development set and a test set containing 250 clinical cases each. This section confirms the existence and structure of the dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PharmaCoNER dataset. The authors reference the original work related to the PharmaCoNER task, which is:

- For the PharmaCoNER dataset, the citation is:
  > Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre, Montserrat Marimon, Ander Intxaurrondo, Obdulia Rabal, Marta Villegas, and Martin Krallinger. *PharmaCoNER: Pharmacological substances, compounds and proteins named entity recognition track*. In Proceedings of the BioNLP Open Shared Tasks (BioNLP-OST), pages 100â€“104, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and prepare to create structured entries for the dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
