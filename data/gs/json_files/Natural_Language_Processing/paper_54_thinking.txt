To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal Transforming Geometric Network" by Jin Li, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experiments show improvements on the CASP12 competition, which suggests that a dataset related to this competition is likely used.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments and Analysis)**, where the authors discuss the training data. Here, they explicitly mention using the **CASP12 ProteinNet dataset** with a thinning of 90%, which consists of around 50,000 structures. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CASP12 dataset. The authors reference a paper by Mohammed AlQuraishi that discusses the ProteinNet dataset. The citation I need to extract is:

- For **CASP12 ProteinNet dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mohammed AlQuraishi. Proteinnet: a standardized data set for machine learning of protein structure. In BMC Bioinformatics, 2019b.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly describes the dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and ready for any further processing or review.
