To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attentional Speech Recognition Models Misbehave on Out-of-Domain Utterances" by Phillip Keung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors discuss decoding audio from the British National Corpus (BNC) and training on the LibriSpeech corpus, which suggests that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods** section, specifically **section 2.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **LibriSpeech Corpus**: This dataset is described as a collection of audio recordings of US English speakers reading passages from public domain books. The authors note that their ASR models were trained on this corpus.

2. **British National Corpus (BNC)**: This dataset consists of spontaneous conversations from UK English speakers, collected in the early 1990s. The authors specify that they selected 39,323 utterances from this corpus for their experiments.

In the same section, the authors also mention creating a clean evaluation subset of 1,607 utterances from the BNC, which is relevant for understanding the dataset's application in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **LibriSpeech Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2015.

- For the **British National Corpus**, the citation is:
  > John Coleman, Ladan Baghai-Ravary, John Pybus, and Sergio Grau. *Audio BNC: The audio edition of the spoken British National Corpus*. Phonetics Laboratory, University of Oxford, 2012.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **LibriSpeech Corpus**: A dataset primarily composed of audio from US English speakers reading passages from public domain books, used for training ASR models.

2. **British National Corpus (BNC)**: A dataset containing spontaneous conversations from UK English speakers, used for evaluating the performance of ASR models on out-of-domain utterances.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation.
