To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Attention Mechanism for Visual Dialog" by Van-Quang Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the experimental results validate the proposed approach on the **VisDial datasets**, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look specifically in **section 5 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors discuss their experimental setup. They state that they used the **VisDial v1.0 dataset** for their experiments, which consists of a training split with 123,287 images, a validation split with 2,064 images, and a test split with 8,000 images. This section provides detailed information about the dataset's structure and its purpose in the context of visual dialog.

Additionally, the authors mention evaluating their method on the **Audio Visual Scene-aware Dialog Dataset (AVSD)**, which is another dataset they utilized for testing the generality of their proposed method. This dataset is noted for requiring a system to generate answers to questions about events seen in a video, indicating its relevance to multimodal tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **VisDial v1.0 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Das, A., Kottur, S., Gupta, K., Singh, A., Yadav, D., Moura, J.M., Parikh, D., & Batra, D. (2017). Visual Dialog. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 326–335.

2. **Audio Visual Scene-aware Dialog Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Hori, C., Alamri, H., Wang, J., Wichern, G., Hori, T., Cherian, A., Marks, T.K., Cartillier, V., Lopes, R.G., Das, A., et al. (2019). End-to-end audio visual scene-aware dialog using multimodal attention-based video features. In ICASSP 2019-2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 2352–2356.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
