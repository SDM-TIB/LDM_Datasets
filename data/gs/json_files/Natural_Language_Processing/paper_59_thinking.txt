To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Word-level Textual Adversarial Attacking as Combinatorial Optimization" by Yuan Zang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed attack model on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Victim Models)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and consists of movie reviews. The authors note that it has 25,000 training instances, 6920 validation instances, and 10,000 test instances.

2. **SST-2 Dataset**: Another dataset for sentiment analysis, SST-2 has 17 average words per sentence and is also binary in classification. The dataset includes 10,000 training instances, 1,821 validation instances, and 10,000 test instances.

3. **SNLI Dataset**: This dataset is used for natural language inference (NLI) tasks. It comprises premise-hypothesis pairs and has 550,152 instances in total.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L Maas, Raymond E Daly, Peter T Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of ACL-HLT, 2011.

- For the **SST-2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of EMNLP, 2013.

- For the **SNLI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Samuel Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of EMNLP, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
