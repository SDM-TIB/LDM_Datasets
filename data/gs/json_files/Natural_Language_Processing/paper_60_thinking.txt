To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HLT@SUDA at SemEval 2019 Task 1: UCCA Graph Parsing as Constituent Tree Parsing" by Wei Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the authors' approach and mentions their performance in various tracks, but does not specify any datasets directly. The introduction provides context about UCCA but does not list datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets used for evaluation are detailed. In this section, the authors mention that they use data provided by the shared task organizer (Hershcovich et al., 2019). They refer to specific datasets such as **English-Wiki**, **English-20K**, **German-20K**, and **French-20K** for their experiments. 

I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets. In Table 1, the authors provide statistics on the distribution of discontinuous structures in the English-Wiki data, which indicates that this dataset is indeed used. 

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The references section provides the necessary citations for the datasets used in the experiments:

1. **English-Wiki Dataset**: This dataset is part of the shared task data provided by the organizers, specifically referenced in:
   > Daniel Hershcovich, Zohar Aizenbud, Leshem Choshen, Elior Sulem, Ari Rappoport, and Omri Abend. 2019. *Semeval 2019 task 1: Cross-lingual semantic parsing with ucca*. arXiv:1903.02953.

2. **English-20K Dataset**: Also part of the shared task data, referenced in the same paper as above.

3. **German-20K Dataset**: Similarly referenced in the same paper.

4. **French-20K Dataset**: This dataset is also part of the shared task data, referenced in the same paper.

Since all these datasets are part of the same shared task, they can be cited collectively using the same reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
