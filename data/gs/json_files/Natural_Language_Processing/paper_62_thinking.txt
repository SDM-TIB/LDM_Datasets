To extract datasets from the research paper titled "YNU NLP at SemEval-2019 Task 5: Attention and Capsule Ensemble for Identifying Hate Speech" by Bin Wang and Haiyan Ding, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in SemEval 2019 Task 5, which involves hate speech detection on Twitter. This suggests that there is a dataset related to this task.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Data and System Description)**, specifically the **subsection 2.1 (Data description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention the official training dataset, development dataset, and test dataset used for the two subtasks (A and B) of the SemEval task.

The datasets are described as follows:

1. **Training Dataset**: Contains 9,000 tweets, with 5,217 labeled as non-hate speech (0) and 3,783 labeled as hate speech (1).
2. **Development Dataset**: Contains 1,000 tweets, with a similar labeling structure.
3. **Test Dataset**: Contains 2,971 tweets, used for final evaluation.

The authors also mention the imbalance in labels for subtasks B (aggressiveness and target classification), but they do not provide specific citations for these datasets.

Since the datasets are part of the SemEval 2019 Task 5, I will look for the official citation for this task in the **References section**. The relevant citation for the SemEval 2019 Task 5 dataset is:

- **SemEval-2019 Task 5 Dataset**: 
  > Valerio Basile, Cristina Bosco, Elisabetta Fersini, Debora Nozza, Viviana Patti, Francisco Rangel, Paolo Rosso, and Manuela Sanguinetti. *SemEval-2019 Task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in Twitter*. In Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the SemEval-2019 Task 5 dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
