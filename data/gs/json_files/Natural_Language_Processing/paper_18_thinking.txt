To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-label Categorization of Accounts of Sexism using a Neural Framework" by Pulkit Parikh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors contribute the largest dataset for sexism categorization, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors describe the dataset comprising **13,023 accounts of sexism**. They mention that these accounts are tagged with at least one of **23 categories of sexism**. This section provides a clear indication of the dataset's size and purpose.

I will then examine the **dataset construction section** (section 3) in detail, as it is likely to contain specific information about how the dataset was created. The authors explain that they collected data from the **Everyday Sexism Project website**, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's origin. They also describe the annotation process involving ten annotators who labeled the accounts based on defined categories.

In this section, I will note the following key details about the dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: Multi-label Sexism Categorization Dataset
- **Size**: 13,023 accounts of sexism
- **Categories**: 23 categories of sexism, later merged into 14 for classification experiments
- **Source**: Everyday Sexism Project website

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Everyday Sexism Project, as it is essential to provide proper attribution for the dataset. The citation is likely to be in the format of a website reference, so I will ensure to format it correctly.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including the full citation, into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, size, categories, and source.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear, concise, and ready for any further processing or review.
