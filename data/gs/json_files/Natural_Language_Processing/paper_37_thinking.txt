To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TENER: Adapting Transformer Encoder for Named Entity Recognition" by Hang Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on six NER datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two English NER datasets and four Chinese NER datasets. I will look for a table or a list that provides detailed information about these datasets.

Upon reviewing **Table 1**, I find the following datasets:

1. **CoNLL2003**: This is a well-known English NER dataset that contains four types of named entities: PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, and MISC. The dataset has 8.5k training sentences, 3.2k development sentences, and 4.3k test sentences.

2. **OntoNotes 5.0**: This dataset includes a diverse corpus from various domains, such as telephone conversations and news articles. It has 14.0k training sentences, 3.5k development sentences, and 203.6k test sentences.

3. **OntoNotes 4.0**: The authors use the Chinese part of this dataset, which has 8.3k training sentences, 59.9k development sentences, and 1088.5k test sentences.

4. **MSRA**: This Chinese NER dataset is derived from news articles and contains 4.4k training sentences, 46.4k development sentences, and 2169.9k test sentences.

5. **Weibo**: This dataset is based on text from the Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo, containing 1.4k training sentences, 0.3k development sentences, and 73.5k test sentences.

6. **Resume**: Annotated by Zhang and Yang (2018), this dataset has 0.5k training sentences, 0.5k development sentences, and 3.8k test sentences.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CoNLL2003**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.
