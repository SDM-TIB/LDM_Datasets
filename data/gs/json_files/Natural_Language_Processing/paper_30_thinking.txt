To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Asking without Telling: Exploring Latent Ontologies in Contextual Representations" by Julian Michael et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context of the research and may reference datasets that are central to the study.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. 

In this paper, the authors mention using the **English Web Treebank** part of **Universal Dependencies 2.2** and the **English portion of Ontonotes 5.0** for various linguistic tasks. I will note these datasets as they are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. **Universal Dependencies 2.2**:
   > Nivre, J., Agić, Ž., Aranzabe, M. J., Asahara, M., Atutxa, A., Ballesteros, M., ... & Zeman, D. (2015). Universal dependencies 1.2. LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ digital library at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (UFAL), Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University.

2. **Ontonotes 5.0**:
   > Weischedel, R., Palmer, M., Marcus, M., Hovy, E., Pradhan, S., Ramshaw, L., & Xue, N. (2013). OntoNotes 5.0. Linguistic Data Consortium, LDC2013T19.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and can be utilized effectively in future research or applications.
