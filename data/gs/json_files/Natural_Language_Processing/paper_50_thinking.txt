To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention over Heads: A Multi-Hop Attention for Neural Machine Translation" by Shohei Iiday et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on the **IWSLT2017** and **WMT17** tasks, which suggests that these may be datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiment)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. They specifically mention that they used **German-English parallel data** obtained from the IWSLT2017 and WMT17 shared tasks. This section provides key information about the datasets, including the number of sentence pairs in the training, validation, and test sets for IWSLT2017, as well as the size of the WMT17 training dataset.

The details I find in this section are as follows:

1. **IWSLT2017 Dataset**: The authors state that the training set contains approximately 160,000 sentence pairs, the validation set has 7,300 sentence pairs, and the test set has 6,700 sentence pairs.

2. **WMT17 Dataset**: The authors mention that this dataset contains approximately 5.9 million sentence pairs in the training dataset, with newstest2013 used as the validation set and newstest2014 and newstest2017 as the test sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **IWSLT2017**, the citation is:
  > IWSLT 2017. *International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation*. Available at: https://sites.google.com/site/iwsltevaluation2017/

- For **WMT17**, the citation is:
  > WMT 2017. *Conference on Machine Translation*. Available at: http://www.statmt.org/wmt17/translation-task.html

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
