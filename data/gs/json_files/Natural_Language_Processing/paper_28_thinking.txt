To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Analysis of Natural Language Inference Systems" by Tiffany Chien and Jugal Kalita, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of standard NLI datasets like **SNLI** and **MNLI**, which are crucial for understanding the context of the research. This indicates that these datasets are foundational to the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. In this case, the **Related Work** and **Models** sections may provide insights into additional datasets or variations that are relevant to the study. 

In the **Results and Analysis** section, the authors discuss various adversarial datasets that challenge the models. I will focus on the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Glockner et al. (2018)**: This dataset modifies SNLI examples to test lexical inferences. The authors mention that it is based on simple lexical relations derived from WordNet.

2. **Naik et al. (2018)**: This dataset is composed of various tests motivated by a manual examination of mistakes made by previous models. It includes categories like antonyms and negation words.

3. **McCoy et al. (2019)**: This dataset is particularly significant as it tests models on syntactic heuristics. It consists of examples generated from manually created templates that break these heuristics.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **SNLI** and **MNLI**, the citations are:
  > Bowman, S. R., Gauthier, J., Rastogi, A., Gupta, R., Manning, C. D., & Potts, C. (2015). *A Fast Unified Model for Parsing and Sentence Understanding*. In Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 2410–2420.

- For **Glockner et al. (2018)**:
  > Glockner, M., Shwartz, V., & Goldberg, Y. (2018). *Breaking NLI Systems with Sentences that Require Simple Lexical Inferences*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers), pp. 650–655.

- For **Naik et al. (2018)**:
  > Naik, A., Ravichander, A., Sadeh, N., Rose, C., & Neubig, G. (2018). *Stress Test Evaluation for Natural Language Inference*. arXiv:1806.00692.

- For **McCoy et al. (2019)**:
  > McCoy, T., Pavlick, E., & Linzen, T. (2019). *Right for the Wrong Reasons: Diagnosing Syntactic Heuristics in Natural Language Inference*. In Proceedings of the 57th Conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 3428–3448.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This methodical approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
