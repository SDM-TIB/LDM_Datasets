To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Contextual Representation Learning Without Softmax Layer" by Liunian Harold Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the efficiency of the proposed framework but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention that they evaluate their approach on several downstream tasks, which often implies the use of specific datasets.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SNLI Dataset**: This dataset is used for the textual entailment task. The authors refer to it as the "SNLI dataset" and provide a citation for it.

2. **CoNLL 2012 Dataset**: This dataset is used for coreference resolution tasks. The authors mention it in the context of the model they are using for evaluation.

3. **SST-5 Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis, specifically for selecting one of five labels to describe a sentence from a movie review.

4. **CoNLL 2003 Dataset**: This dataset is used for named entity recognition (NER) tasks. The authors specify that it consists of newswire tagged with different entity types.

5. **Pradhan et al. (2013) Dataset**: This dataset is used for semantic role labeling (SRL) tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **SNLI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In EMNLP, 2015.

- For the **CoNLL 2012 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sameer Pradhan, Alessandro Moschitti, and Nianwen Xue, editors. *EMNLP-CoNLL*, 2012.

- For the **SST-5 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Y. Ng, and Chris Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In EMNLP, 2013.

- For the **CoNLL 2003 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Erik F. Sang and Fien De Meulder. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In CoNLL, 2003.

- For the **Pradhan et al. (2013) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sameer Pradhan, Alessandro Moschitti, Nianwen Xue, Hwee Tou Ng, Anders Bj√∂rkelund, Olga Uryupina, Yuchen Zhang, and Zhi Zhong. *Towards robust linguistic analysis using ontonotes*. In CoNLL, 2013.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited according to the requirements of the task. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly identified and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
