To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Context is Key: Grammatical Error Detection with Contextual Word Representations" by Samuel Bell et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of their method on a range of public GED datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be found.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference several previous works that utilized public error-annotated corpora, hinting at the datasets used in their own research. However, I need to find the specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **First Certificate in English (FCE) dataset**: This dataset consists of essays written by non-native learners of English, annotated with spans of language errors, types of errors, and suggested corrections. 

2. **CoNLL 2014 shared task dataset**: This dataset includes English essays written by advanced undergraduate students, annotated by two experienced annotators with a different error taxonomy.

3. **JFLEG dataset**: The Johns Hopkins University FLuency-Extended GUG Corpus contains essays written by English learners, annotated with fluency and grammar edits by multiple annotators.

4. **Cambridge English Write & Improve (W&I) corpus**: Released as part of the BEA 2019 shared task, this corpus contains texts written by learners of English submitted for assessment.

5. **LOCNESS corpus**: Also part of the BEA 2019 shared task, this corpus comprises essays written by native English students.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used the FCE training set for training and evaluated their models on the FCE test set, CoNLL-2014 test set, JFLEG test set, and BEA 2019 shared task datasets. This confirms the datasets they utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
