To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Layer Normalization in the Transformer Architecture" by Ruibin Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention two main tasks: **machine translation** and **unsupervised pre-training**. I will look for specific datasets associated with these tasks.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **IWSLT14 German-to-English (De-En) dataset**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks. The authors specify that it contains about 153K sentence pairs for training, with 7K pairs each for validation and testing.

2. **WMT14 English-to-German (En-De) dataset**: This dataset is also used for machine translation and consists of approximately 4.5 million training parallel sentence pairs.

3. **BookCorpus**: This dataset is used for unsupervised pre-training. The authors mention that it is no longer freely distributed, but they followed guidelines to collect it themselves. The combined dataset with English Wikipedia contains roughly 3.4 billion words.

4. **Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC)**: This dataset is used for evaluating paraphrase detection, consisting of sentence pairs with human annotations for semantic equivalence.

5. **Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE)**: This dataset is used for textual entailment tasks, derived from a series of annual challenges.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the references section of the paper:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
