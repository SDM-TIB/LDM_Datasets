To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural language understanding for task oriented dialog in the biomedical domain in a low resources context" by Antoine Neuraz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets or data generation methods. The abstract indicates that the authors explore data generation due to the lack of sharable datasets in the biomedical domain, which suggests that they may have created or utilized specific datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Data generation and augmentation)**, where the authors describe their methods for generating training datasets. Here, they mention collecting a set of **178 questions** from medical doctors, which they annotated as a gold standard. This indicates that they have created a dataset based on real-world queries.

In **section 2.1**, the authors detail the task of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) in querying Electronic Health Records (EHRs). They mention the generation of a training dataset using templates and lab mentions, which implies that they have constructed a dataset for training their NLU model.

I will also look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **experiments** section. The authors describe generating **16,000 utterances** for the training set and **4,000 for the development set**, indicating that these are part of the datasets they created.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets identified:

1. **Generated Training Dataset**: This dataset consists of 16,000 utterances created from templates and lab mentions. It is specifically designed for training the NLU model in the biomedical context.

2. **Development Dataset**: This dataset contains 4,000 utterances generated similarly to the training dataset, used for evaluating the model's performance.

Next, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. However, since the datasets are generated by the authors themselves and not sourced from existing datasets, there may not be formal citations for them. Instead, I will note that the datasets are based on the authors' own data generation methods.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

- **Generated Training Dataset**: 16,000 utterances created from templates and lab mentions for training the NLU model.
- **Development Dataset**: 4,000 utterances generated for evaluating the model's performance.

Since these datasets are original creations by the authors, I will not provide external citations but will acknowledge their methodology as described in the paper.

Now, I will prepare to format this information into the required output structure for further processing.
