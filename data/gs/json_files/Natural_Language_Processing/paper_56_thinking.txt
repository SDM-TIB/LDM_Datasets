To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Regularized Context Gates on Transformer for Machine Translation" by Xintong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that "Extensive experiments on 4 translation datasets demonstrate that the proposed model obtains an averaged gain of 1.0 BLEU score over a strong Transformer baseline." This indicates that multiple datasets are used, prompting me to look for their names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors mention the datasets used for evaluation. In the text, they refer to the following datasets:

1. **NIST**: The paper mentions using NIST datasets for the ZH-EN translation task, specifically NIST05, NIST06, and NIST08. These datasets are commonly used for evaluating machine translation systems.

2. **IWSLT**: The authors also mention using the IWSLT14 and IWSLT17 datasets for the EN-FR translation task. These datasets are widely recognized in the machine translation community.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

- For the **NIST datasets**, the citation is:
  > NIST. *NIST Open Machine Translation Evaluation*. Available at: http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/openmt.cfm.

- For the **IWSLT datasets**, the citation is:
  > IWSLT. *International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation*. Available at: http://workshop2014.iwslt.org/ and http://workshop2017.iwslt.org/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper for future reference or analysis.
