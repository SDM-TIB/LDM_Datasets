To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How to Fine-Tune BERT for Text Classification?" by Chi Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on eight widely-studied text classification datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved. I will note this and look for specific names in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **Methodology** and **Experiments** sections, particularly section 5, which discusses the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors provide a table (Table 1) that lists the statistics of the eight text classification datasets. I will extract the names of these datasets along with their respective details.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **IMDb**: A binary sentiment analysis dataset consisting of 50,000 reviews.
2. **Yelp P. (Yelp Polarity)**: A binary sentiment analysis dataset with 560,000 reviews.
3. **Yelp F. (Yelp Full)**: A five-class sentiment analysis dataset with 650,000 reviews.
4. **TREC**: A question classification dataset with 5,452 questions across six classes.
5. **Yahoo! Answers**: A question classification dataset with 1,400,000 questions across ten classes.
6. **AG’s News**: A topic classification dataset with 120,000 news articles across four categories.
7. **DBPedia**: A topic classification dataset with 560,000 articles across 14 categories.
8. **Sogou News**: A Chinese topic classification dataset with 54,000 articles across six categories.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets effectively for further analysis or processing.
