To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Train, Sort, Explain: Learning to Diagnose Translation Models" by Robert Schwarzenberg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of translation models and mentions a dataset translated by a state-of-the-art neural Transformer model, which indicates that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Datasets and Experiments)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention that they tested their implementation, DiaMaT, on a corpus translated by an NMT Transformer engine conforming to the **WMT14 data setup**. They also state that the NMT model was optimized on the test set of **WMT13** and trained using **WMT18 training data**.

I will note the following datasets mentioned in this section:

1. **WMT14 Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the translation model. It is part of the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT) series, which provides standard datasets for benchmarking machine translation systems.

2. **WMT13 Dataset**: This dataset is used for optimizing the NMT model. It is also part of the WMT series and serves as a training set for various translation tasks.

3. **WMT18 Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the CNN text classifier. It includes human references and machine translations alongside their sources.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The WMT datasets are typically cited in the context of their respective workshops, so I will look for the appropriate citations:

- For **WMT14**, the citation is:
  > Ondrej Bojar, Christian Buck, Christian Federmann, Barry Haddow, Philipp Koehn, Johannes Leveling, Christof Monz, Pavel Pecina, Matt Post, Herve Saint-Amand, Radu Soricut, Lucia Specia, and Aleš Tamchyna. *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 12–58, Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2014.

- For **WMT13**, the citation is:
  > Ondrej Bojar, Christian Buck, Christian Federmann, Barry Haddow, Philipp Koehn, Johannes Leveling, Christof Monz, Pavel Pecina, Matt Post, Herve Saint-Amand, Radu Soricut, Lucia Specia, and Aleš Tamchyna. *Findings of the 2013 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1–12, Sofia, Bulgaria. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2013.

- For **WMT18**, the citation is:
  > Ondrej Bojar, Christian Federmann, Mark Fishel, Yvette Graham, Barry Haddow, Matthias Huck, Philipp Koehn, and Christof Monz. *Findings of the 2018 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT18)*. In Proceedings of the Third Conference on Machine Translation, Volume 2: Shared Task Papers, pages 272–307, Belgium, Brussels. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
