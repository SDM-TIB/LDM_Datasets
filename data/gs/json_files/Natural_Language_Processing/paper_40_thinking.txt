To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Humpty Dumpty: Controlling Word Meanings via Corpus Poisoning" by Roei Schuster et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the manipulation of word embeddings through corpus poisoning, which suggests that datasets related to word embeddings or corpora might be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets or corpora that are referenced. In this paper, the authors mention using **Wikipedia** as a source corpus for their experiments, which is a significant dataset in the context of natural language processing.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. For example, if the authors refer to specific datasets or corpora that are well-known in the field, I will ensure to capture those citations accurately.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Wikipedia**: The authors used a full Wikipedia text dump as the primary dataset for their experiments. This dataset is crucial for training the word embeddings they manipulate in their study.

2. **Twitter**: The authors also mention using a subset of Twitter data, specifically a sample of tweets, for their experiments. This dataset is relevant for testing the robustness of their corpus poisoning techniques in a social media context.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Wikipedia**, the citation is:
  > Wikipedia contributors. *Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia*. [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), Accessed: January 20, 2018.

- For **Twitter**, the citation is:
  > Twitter, Inc. *Twitter Stream Archive*. [Twitter Archive](https://archive.org/download/hiveteam-twitter-stream-2018-10), Accessed: October 2018.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
