To extract datasets from the research paper titled "E-BERT: Efficient-Yet-Effective Entity Embeddings for BERT" by Nina Poerner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Unsupervised QA)**, where the authors discuss their evaluation on the LAMA benchmark. They mention using **LAMA-Google-RE** and **LAMA-T-REx**, which are specific datasets used for their experiments. I will take note of these datasets and their descriptions.

In **section 5 (Downstream tasks)**, the authors describe their evaluation on two additional tasks: relation classification and entity linking. They mention using a dataset from **Zhang et al. (2019)**, which is a subset of the FewRel corpus. I will ensure to capture this dataset as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **LAMA**: The citation for the LAMA benchmark is:
   > Fabio Petroni, Tim Rockt¨aschel, Patrick Lewis, Anton Bakhtin, Yuxiang Wu, Alexander H Miller, and Sebastian Riedel. *Language models as knowledge bases?* In EMNLP-IJCNLP, Hong Kong, China, 2019.

2. **FewRel**: The citation for the FewRel dataset is:
   > Haitian Sun, Bhuwan Dhingra, Manzil Zaheer, Kathryn Mazaitis, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and William Cohen. *Open domain question answering using early fusion of knowledge bases and text.* In EMNLP, pages 4231–4242, Brussels, Belgium, 2018.

3. **T-REx**: The citation for the T-REx dataset is:
   > Hady Elsahar, Pavlos Vougiouklis, Arslen Remaci, Jonathon Hare, Frédérique Laforest, and Elena Simperl. *T-REx: A large scale alignment of natural language with knowledge base triples.* In LREC, pages 3448–3452, Miyazaki, Japan, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
