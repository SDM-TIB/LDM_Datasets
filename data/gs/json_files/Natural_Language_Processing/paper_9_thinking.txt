To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-modality Latent Interaction Network for Visual Question Answering" by Peng Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method achieves competitive performance on public VQA benchmarks, specifically **VQA v2.0** and **TDIUC**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **VQA v2.0**: This dataset is an updated version of VQA v1.0, designed to reduce data bias. It contains train, validation, and test sets with a total of 443,757 questions across 82,743 images.

2. **TDIUC**: This dataset consists of 1.6 million questions divided into 12 categories, aimed at addressing the bias found in VQA v2.0.

In **section 4.4 (Comparison with State of the Art Methods)**, the authors further confirm that they compare their method against previous approaches on both VQA v2.0 and TDIUC datasets, reinforcing that these are the datasets they utilized for evaluation.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **VQA v2.0**, the citation is:
  > Stanislaw Antol, Aishwarya Agrawal, Jiasen Lu, Margaret Mitchell, Dhruv Batra, C Lawrence Zitnick, and Devi Parikh. *VQA: Visual Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 2425–2433, 2015.

- For **TDIUC**, the citation is:
  > Kushal Kafle and Christopher Kanan. *An Analysis of Visual Question Answering Algorithms*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 1965–1973, 2017.

With this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
