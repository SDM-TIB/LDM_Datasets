To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Positional Embedding for Neural Machine Translation" by Kehai Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their methods on the **WMT’14 English-to-German** and **NIST Chinese-to-English** translation tasks, suggesting that these tasks are associated with specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. They mention that the **WMT’14** training set consists of **4.43 million bilingual sentence pairs** and the **NIST Chinese-to-English** training set includes **1.28 million bilingual sentence pairs** from the LDC corpora. This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **WMT’14 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bojar, O., et al. (2014). *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1–30.

- For the **NIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > NIST. (2006). *NIST Open Machine Translation Evaluation*. Available at: https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/open-machine-translation-evaluation.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will allow for a structured output that can be easily processed or reviewed later.
