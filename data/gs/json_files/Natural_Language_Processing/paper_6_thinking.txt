To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unified Language Model Pre-training for Natural Language Understanding and Generation" by Li Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the model achieves state-of-the-art results on several natural language generation datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets used for evaluation. I will look for explicit mentions of these datasets.

Next, I will carefully read through the **experiments section** (Section 3) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used for various tasks. In this section, the authors discuss their experiments on different tasks, including summarization and question answering, and they mention specific datasets associated with these tasks.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets:

1. **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**: This dataset is used for the abstractive summarization task. The authors mention using the non-anonymized version of this dataset for model fine-tuning and evaluation.

2. **Gigaword Dataset**: Another dataset used for the abstractive summarization task, which is mentioned alongside CNN/DailyMail.

3. **SQuAD 2.0 Dataset**: This dataset is used for extractive question answering, and the authors provide results based on their model's performance on this dataset.

4. **CoQA Dataset**: This dataset is used for conversational question answering, and the authors describe their approach and results on this dataset.

5. **SQuAD 1.1 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of the question generation task, where the authors generate questions based on answer spans.

6. **DSTC7 Dataset**: This dataset is used for document-grounded dialog response generation, and the authors report their results on this dataset.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

- For the **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Gigaword Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that they are properly documented and ready for further processing or review.
