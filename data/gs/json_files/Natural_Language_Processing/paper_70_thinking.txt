To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal Dependencies According to BERT: Both More Specific and More General" by Tomasz Limisiewicz, Rudolf Rosa, and David Mareček, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for analysis or experimentation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their analysis of BERT's syntactic abstractions and mention using various linguistic resources. This suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Models and Data)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their analysis. Here, they refer to:

1. **EuroParl**: A dataset consisting of 1000 multi-parallel sentences for five European languages, which is automatically annotated with Universal Dependencies (UD) using UDPipe models.

2. **Google Universal Dependency Treebanks (GSD)**: This dataset is used for Indonesian, Korean, and Japanese languages.

3. **UD Turkish Treebank (IMST-UD)**: This dataset is specifically mentioned for Turkish language analysis.

4. **PUD treebanks**: These are used for evaluating mBERT across multiple languages, as mentioned in the context of the CoNLL 2017 Shared Task.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **EuroParl**, the citation is:
  > Philipp Koehn. *Europarl: A parallel corpus for statistical machine translation*. 2004.

- For **Google Universal Dependency Treebanks**, the citation is:
  > Ryan McDonald et al. *Universal dependency annotation for multilingual parsing*. In Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers), pages 92–97, 2013.

- For **UD Turkish Treebank (IMST-UD)**, the citation is:
  > Umut Sulubacak, Gülşen Eryiğit, and Tuğba Pamay. *IMST: A revisited Turkish dependency treebank*. In Proceedings of TurCLing 2016, the 1st International Conference on Turkic Computational Linguistics, pages 1–6, 2016.

- For **PUD treebanks**, the citation is:
  > Joakim Nivre et al. *Universal dependencies v1: A multilingual treebank collection*. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’16), pages 1659–1666, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets utilized in the research.
