To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Token-Level Ensemble Distillation for Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion" by Hao Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **CMUDict dataset** and an **internal English dataset**, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **CMUDict 0.7b**: This is a publicly available dataset used for G2P conversion. The authors specify that it contains 108,952 training words, 5,447 validation words, and 12,855 test words. They also note the sizes of the grapheme and phoneme vocabularies.

2. **Internal Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 184,243 training words, 10,837 validation words, and 21,678 test words. The authors mention that it includes uppercase and lowercase letters and stress markings.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. 

For the **CMUDict dataset**, the citation is:
> Z. Zhang, J. D. Williams, and A. M. Rush. *CMU Pronouncing Dictionary*. [Online]. Available: http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict

Since the internal dataset is not publicly available, it does not have a formal citation. However, I will note that it is an internal dataset used by the authors.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CMUDict dataset and a note regarding the internal dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
