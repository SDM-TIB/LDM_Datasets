To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Segatron: Segment-Aware Transformer for Language Modeling and Understanding" by He Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved a perplexity of 17.1 on the **WikiText-103 dataset**, indicating that this dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. Here, the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for training and evaluation. They specifically mention the **WikiText-103 dataset** as a large word-level dataset with long-distance dependencies for language modeling. The paper provides details about the dataset, such as the number of tokens (103M), the number of articles (28K), and the average length of articles (3.6K tokens).

Additionally, I will check the **data preparation section** where the authors mention using **English Wikipedia** and **BookCorpus** for pre-training their models. This indicates that both datasets are relevant for their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **WikiText-103 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2017). Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models. In ICLR 2017, Toulon, France, April 24-26, 2017.

2. For the **BookCorpus dataset**, the citation is:
   > Zhu, Y., Kiros, R., Zemel, R. S., Salakhutdinov, R., Urtasun, R., Torralba, A., & Fidler, S. (2015). Aligning Books and Movies: Towards Story-Like Visual Explanations by Watching Movies and Reading Books. In ICCV 2015, Santiago, Chile, December 7-13, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
