To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving the Performance of Online Neural Transducer Models" by Tara N. Sainath et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental details** sections to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "Voice Search task," which suggests that there may be a dataset associated with this task.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental details section** (section 4), where the authors describe their experiments. They mention conducting experiments on a "∼12,500 hour training set consisting of 15 million English utterances." This indicates a large dataset used for training, which is likely to be significant for the research.

I will also look for any specific names or citations of datasets within the text. The authors describe the dataset as being created by "artificially corrupting clean utterances using a room simulator," but they do not provide a specific name for this dataset. However, they do mention that the data is representative of Google’s voice search traffic, which could be useful for citation purposes.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss their findings based on the experiments conducted on the Voice Search dataset. They also mention using "anonymized and hand-transcribed" utterances, which further emphasizes the nature of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset used. However, it appears that the dataset itself is not attributed to a specific paper or source, as it seems to be an internal dataset created by Google for their voice search application.

Since the dataset does not have a formal citation, I will summarize the information I have gathered:

1. **Voice Search Dataset**: A large dataset consisting of approximately 12,500 hours of training data, containing 15 million anonymized and hand-transcribed English utterances. This dataset is representative of Google’s voice search traffic and was created by artificially corrupting clean utterances using a room simulator.

Since there are no formal citations provided for this dataset in the paper, I will note that it is an internal dataset from Google and does not have a specific reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring to highlight the lack of a formal citation for the Voice Search dataset.
