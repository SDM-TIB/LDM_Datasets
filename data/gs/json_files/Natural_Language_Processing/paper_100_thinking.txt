To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Reinforced Generation of Adversarial Examples for Neural Machine Translation" by Wei Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on various neural machine translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data Sets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **LDC German-English Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1.3 million parallel sentence pairs used for training the victim models.
2. **LDC Chinese-English Dataset**: This dataset contains 4.5 million parallel sentence pairs, also used for training.
3. **WMT14 English-French Dataset**: This dataset includes 2.2 million parallel sentence pairs for the English to French translation task.
4. **WMT15 English-German Dataset**: This dataset is used for the English to German translation task, although the exact number of pairs is not specified.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were utilized for training their models, which solidifies their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not be explicitly listed as datasets but rather as sources or papers that describe them. I will look for the following:

- For the **LDC German-English Dataset**, I will refer to the LDC (Linguistic Data Consortium) website or relevant publications that describe this dataset.
- For the **LDC Chinese-English Dataset**, I will do the same as above.
- For the **WMT14 and WMT15 datasets**, I will look for the official WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation) proceedings or associated papers that provide details about these datasets.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
