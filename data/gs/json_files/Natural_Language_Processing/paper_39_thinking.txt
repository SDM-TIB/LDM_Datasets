To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-tuning BERT for Joint Entity and Relation Extraction in Chinese Medical Text" by Kui Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental studies sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "coronary angiography texts collected from Shuguang Hospital," which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental studies section** (Section IV), where the authors provide details about the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the dataset consists of entity and relation extraction data collected from coronary arteriography reports in Shanghai Shuguang Hospital. They also describe the types of entities and relations included in the dataset, which provides context for its use.

In this section, the authors specify that there are five types of entities (Negation, Body Part, Degree, Quantiﬁer, and Location) and five relations (Negative, Modiﬁer, Position, Percentage, and No Relation). They also mention that 85% of "No Relation" instances were discarded for balance purposes. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from reports from Shuguang Hospital, I will note that the authors do not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself in the references. However, I can create a citation based on the information provided in the paper:

- **Coronary Angiography Dataset**: This dataset is collected from coronary arteriography reports at Shuguang Hospital, Shanghai. While a formal citation is not provided, it can be referenced as:
  > Xue, K., Zhou, Y., Ma, Z., Ruan, T., Zhang, H., & He, P. (Year). Fine-tuning BERT for Joint Entity and Relation Extraction in Chinese Medical Text. *Journal/Conference Name*, *Volume*(Issue), Page range. [Link if available]

Since the exact year, journal name, volume, and page range are not specified in the provided text, I will leave placeholders for these details.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset name, description, and citation, into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details about the dataset used in the research.
