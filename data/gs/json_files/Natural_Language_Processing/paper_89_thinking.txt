To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text2Node: a Cross-Domain System for Mapping Arbitrary Phrases to a Taxonomy" by Rohollah Soltani and Alexandre Tomberg, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a system called Text2Node for mapping medical phrases to a taxonomy, specifically SNOMED CT, which suggests that datasets related to medical phrases and taxonomies may be involved.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of data interchangeability in electronic health records (EHR) and mention various coding systems, but I need to identify specific datasets used in their experiments.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe the corpus used for training word embeddings, which includes:
1. **MIMIC-III Clinical Database**: A freely accessible critical care database containing clinical data.
2. **FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)**: A database of adverse event reports related to drugs.
3. **2010 Relations Challenge from i2b2**: A dataset used for natural language processing tasks in clinical settings.

I will also check the **evaluation section** for any additional datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the **ICD-9-CM** phrases that were mapped to SNOMED CT concepts, indicating that this coding system is part of their evaluation process.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **MIMIC-III Clinical Database**:
   > Alistair E.W. Johnson, Tom J. Pollard, Lu Shen, H. Lehman Li-wei, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G. Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3:160035, 2016.

2. **FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)**:
   > U.S. Food and Drug Administration. *FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)*. [Online]. Available: https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/default.htm

3. **2010 Relations Challenge from i2b2**:
   > Özlem Uzuner, Brett R. South, Shuying Shen, and Scott L. DuVall. *2010 i2b2/VA Challenge on Concepts, Assertions, and Relations in Clinical Text*. Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 18(5):552–556, 2011.

4. **ICD-9-CM**:
   > U.S. National Library of Medicine. *ICD-9-CM Diagnostic Codes to SNOMED CT Map*, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly to ensure they are ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their proper citations from the paper.
