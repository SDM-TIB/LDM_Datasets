To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Warm-up and Self-Training: Training Strategies of NICT-2 NMT System at WAT-2019" by Kenji Imamura and Eiichiro Sumita, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in three tasks: ASPEC.en-ja, ASPEC.ja-en, and TDDC.ja-en. This suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (System Summary)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for the ASPEC tasks. They refer to the **Asian Scientific Paper Excerpt Corpus** for the ASPEC tasks and the **Timely Disclosure Documents Corpus (TDDC)** for the TDDC task. This section provides a clear identification of the datasets.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide detailed information about the corpus sizes, which includes the number of sentences for each dataset. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Asian Scientific Paper Excerpt Corpus (ASPEC)**, the citation is:
   > Toshiaki Nakazawa, Manabu Yaguchi, Kiyotaka Uchimoto, Masao Utiyama, Eiichiro Sumita, Sadao Kurohashi, and Hitoshi Isahara. *ASPEC: Asian scientific paper excerpt corpus*. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016), pages 2204–2208, Portorož, Slovenia.

2. For the **Timely Disclosure Documents Corpus (TDDC)**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, so I will note that it is referred to as TDDC in the paper, but I will need to verify if there is a specific citation available elsewhere.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
