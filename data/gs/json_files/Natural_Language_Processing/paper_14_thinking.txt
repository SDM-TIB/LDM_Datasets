To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting BERT for End-to-End Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis" by Xin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors investigate the modeling power of BERT on the E2E-ABSA task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) task and reference benchmark datasets from SemEval ABSA challenges. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

In the **experiments section**, specifically in **section 3.1**, the authors explicitly mention conducting experiments on two review datasets originating from SemEval, which are summarized in Table 3. The datasets are:

1. **LAPTOP Dataset**: This dataset is used for aspect-based sentiment analysis and contains a total of 4245 sentences with 304 training sentences and 800 test sentences.

2. **REST Dataset**: Another dataset for aspect-based sentiment analysis, which has a total of 6035 sentences, with 256 training sentences and 2158 test sentences.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the SemEval challenges for the datasets, so I will look for the relevant citations:

- For the **LAPTOP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maria Pontiki, Dimitris Galanis, Haris Papageorgiou, Ion Androutsopoulos, Suresh Manandhar, and Mohammad AL-Smadi. *SemEval-2014 task 4: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In SemEval, pages 27–35, 2014.

- For the **REST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maria Pontiki, Dimitris Galanis, Haris Papageorgiou, Ion Androutsopoulos, and Suresh Manandhar. *SemEval-2015 task 12: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In SemEval, pages 486–495, 2015.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
