To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extroﬁtting: Enriching Word Representation and its Vector Space with Semantic Lexicons" by Hwiyeol Jo and Stanley Jungkyu Choi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of word representation and mention the use of semantic lexicons, but they do not specify datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section**.

In **section 4 (Experiment Data)**, the authors explicitly mention several datasets used for evaluation:

1. **MEN-3k**: This dataset consists of 3000-word pairs rated from 0 to 50, which is used for evaluating word similarity tasks.
2. **WordSim-353**: This dataset contains 353-word pairs rated from 0 to 10, also used for word similarity evaluation.
3. **SimLex-999**: This dataset includes 999-word pairs rated from 0 to 10, focusing on genuine similarity estimation.
4. **RG-65**: This dataset has 65 word pairs scored from 0 to 4, used for word similarity tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MEN-3k**, the citation is:
  > Elia Bruni, N Tram, Marco Baroni, et al. *Multi-modal distributional semantics*. The Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 49:1–47, 2014.

- For **WordSim-353**, the citation is:
  > Lev Finkelstein, Evgeniy Gabrilovich, Yossi Matias, Ehud Rivlin, Zach Solan, Gadi Wolfman, and Eytan Ruppin. *Placing search in context: The concept revisited*. In Proceedings of the 10th international conference on World Wide Web, pages 406–414, ACM, 2001.

- For **SimLex-999**, the citation is:
  > Felix Hill, Roi Reichart, and Anna Korhonen. *Simlex-999: Evaluating semantic models with (genuine) similarity estimation*. Computational Linguistics, 41(4):665–695, 2015.

- For **RG-65**, the citation is:
  > Herbert Rubenstein and John B Goodenough. *Contextual correlates of synonymy*. Communications of the ACM, 8(10):627–633, 1965.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, description, and full citation.
