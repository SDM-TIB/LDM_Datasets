To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LXMERT: Learning Cross-Modality Encoder Representations from Transformers" by Hao Tan and Mohit Bansal, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on two visual question answering datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, particularly in **section 4.1 (Evaluated Datasets)**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **VQA v2.0**: This dataset is used for visual question answering and is mentioned as having 1.1 million questions. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Goyal, Y., Khot, T., Summers-Stay, D., Batra, D., & Parikh, D. (2017). Making the V in VQA matter: Elevating the role of image understanding in visual question answering. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 6904â€“6913.

2. **GQA**: This dataset is also for visual question answering and is noted for requiring more reasoning skills, with 22 million questions generated from ground truth image scene graphs. The citation for GQA is:
   > Hudson, A. D., & Manning, C. D. (2019). GQA: A new dataset for compositional question answering over real-world images. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

3. **NLVR2**: This dataset is used for visual reasoning and consists of pairs of images and natural language statements. The citation for NLVR2 is:
   > Suhr, A., Zhou, S., Zhang, I., Bai, H., & Artzi, Y. (2019). A corpus for reasoning about natural language grounded in photographs. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their descriptions and the context in which they are used within the paper. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations for future use or analysis.
