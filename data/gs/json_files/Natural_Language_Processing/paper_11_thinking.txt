To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Large-Scale Document-Level Neural Machine Translation" by Marcin Junczys-Dowmunt, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that the focus is on document-level neural machine translation, which suggests that there may be specific datasets used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will look for sections that explicitly discuss datasets, such as **section 3 (Data and Data Preparation)**. Here, the author describes the types of data used, including document-level parallel data and monolingual data. I will note any specific datasets mentioned, such as "Europarl," "Rapid," and "News-Commentary," as these are likely to be important datasets for the research.

In **subsection 3.1.1 (Document-level Mark-up)**, the author discusses how they use document boundaries to create document-level sequences. This indicates that they are working with datasets that have been structured to include these boundaries, which is crucial for understanding the context of the translations.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For example, the author references the Europarl dataset, which is a well-known parallel corpus for machine translation. I will ensure to include the full citation for this dataset.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that full citations are provided. This will include:

1. **Europarl Dataset**: A parallel corpus consisting of the proceedings of the European Parliament, widely used for training machine translation systems.
   - Citation: > Philipp Koehn, Christof Monz, and others. *Europarl: A Parallel Corpus for Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Tenth Machine Translation Summit, pages 79â€“86, 2005.

2. **Rapid Dataset**: A dataset used for training document-level translation models, though specific details may need to be confirmed from the text.
   - Citation: > [Citation details to be confirmed from the paper or external sources].

3. **News-Commentary Dataset**: A collection of news articles and their translations, often used in machine translation tasks.
   - Citation: > [Citation details to be confirmed from the paper or external sources].

By following this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing full citations for each dataset to maintain academic integrity and facilitate further research.
