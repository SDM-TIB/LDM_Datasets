To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scheduled Sampling for Transformers" by Tsvetomila Mihaylova and André F. T. Martins, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the application of scheduled sampling in Transformer models for machine translation, but it does not mention specific datasets. The introduction provides context about the problem of exposure bias in sequence-to-sequence models, but again, no datasets are explicitly named.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on two language pairs: **IWSLT 2017 German−English (DE−EN)** and **KFTT Japanese−English (JA−EN)**. This indicates that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **IWSLT 2017 German−English (DE−EN)** dataset, the citation is:
   > Mauro Cettolo, Marcello Federico, Luisa Bentivogli, Jan Niehues, Sebastian Stüker, Katsuitho Sudoh, Koichiro Yoshino, and Christian Federmann. *Overview of the IWSLT 2017 Evaluation Campaign*. In International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, pages 2–14, 2017.

2. For the **KFTT Japanese−English (JA−EN)** dataset, the citation is:
   > Graham Neubig. *The Kyoto Free Translation Task*. 2011.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

- The paper utilizes the **IWSLT 2017 German−English (DE−EN)** dataset for machine translation experiments.
- The paper also utilizes the **KFTT Japanese−English (JA−EN)** dataset for machine translation experiments.

Now, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
