To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Learning with Contextual Embeddings for Zero-resource Cross-lingual Classification and NER" by Phillip Keung et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors report improvements on the **multilingual MLDoc text classification** and **CoNLL 2002/2003 named entity recognition (NER)** tasks, suggesting that these datasets are likely to be included in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In **section 3.2 (MLDoc Classification Results)**, the authors mention that they finetuned BERT on the English portion of the **MLDoc corpus**, which is a 4-class classification problem. They specify that this dataset is a class-balanced subset of the **Reuters News RCV1 and RCV2 datasets**. This gives me the first dataset to document.

In **section 3.3 (CoNLL NER Results)**, the authors state that they finetuned BERT on the English portion of the **CoNLL 2002/2003 NER corpus**. This is another dataset that I need to include.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MLDoc corpus**, the citation is:
   > Holger Schwenk and Xian Li. *A corpus for multilingual document classification in eight languages*. In Proceedings of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC), 2018.

2. For the **CoNLL 2002/2003 NER corpus**, the citation is:
   > Erik F. Sang and Fien De Meulder. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), 2003.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
