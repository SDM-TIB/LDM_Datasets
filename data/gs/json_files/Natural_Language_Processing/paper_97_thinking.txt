To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Domain Adaptation with BERT-based Domain Classification and Data Selection" by Xiaofei Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their framework on "four large public datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used. Here, they mention four datasets across three task categories: 

1. **SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference)**: The authors describe it as a collection of 570,000 human-written English sentence pairs for the task of natural language inference. 

2. **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset consists of 433,000 sentence pairs annotated with textual entailment information, covering various genres.

3. **QNLI (Question-answering Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is derived from the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and involves question-paragraph pairs.

4. **QQP (Quora Question Pairs)**: This dataset contains question pairs from Quora, where the task is to determine if the questions are semantically equivalent.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- For **SNLI**, the citation is:
  > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 632–640, 2015.

- For **MNLI**, the citation is:
  > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel R. Bowman. *A Broad-Coverage Challenge Corpus for Sentence Understanding through Inference*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1112–1122, 2017.

- For **QNLI**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 2383–2392, 2016.

- For **QQP**, the citation is:
  > Zhiguo Wang, Wael Hamza, and Radu Florian. *Bilateral multi-perspective matching for natural language sentences*. In Proceedings of the 2017 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), pages 4144–4150, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
