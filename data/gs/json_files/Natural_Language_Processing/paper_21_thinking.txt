To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "A Simple but Effective Method to Incorporate Multi-turn Context with BERT for Conversational Machine Comprehension" by Yasuhito Ohsugi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to experiments conducted on **two conversational machine comprehension datasets, QuAC and CoQA**. This indicates that these datasets are significant to the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** where the authors explicitly mention both datasets: "Recently, two datasets, QuAC (Choi et al., 2018) and CoQA (Reddy et al., 2018), were released to answer sequential questions in a dialogue by comprehending a paragraph." This confirms that these datasets are indeed used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section 5, the authors discuss the evaluation of their method on both datasets, providing further confirmation of their relevance. They mention that their method outperformed published methods on both QuAC and CoQA, which reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

1. For **QuAC**, the citation is:
   > Eunsol Choi, He He, Mohit Iyyer, Mark Yatskar, Wentao Yih, Yejin Choi, Percy Liang, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *Quac: Question answering in context*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2174â€“2184. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. For **CoQA**, the citation is:
   > Siva Reddy, Danqi Chen, and Christopher D. Manning. *CoQA: A conversational question answering challenge*. CoRR, abs/1808.07042.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included as required. This will allow for proper documentation and referencing in any subsequent analysis or application of the datasets.
