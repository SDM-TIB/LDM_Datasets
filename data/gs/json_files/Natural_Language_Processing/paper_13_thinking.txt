To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-Training with Whole Word Masking for Chinese BERT" by Yiming Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various Chinese NLP tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention conducting extensive experiments on **ten Chinese NLP tasks** and provide a list of datasets used for these tasks.

I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experimental setups** section, where they detail the tasks and corresponding datasets. The paper lists the following datasets:

1. **CMRC 2018**: A span-extraction machine reading comprehension dataset similar to SQuAD.
2. **DRCD**: A span-extraction MRC dataset in Traditional Chinese.
3. **CJRC**: A dataset for Chinese judicial reading comprehension.
4. **ChnSentiCorp**: A dataset for sentiment classification in Chinese.
5. **THUCNews**: A dataset containing news articles across various genres.
6. **TNEWS**: A short text classification dataset consisting of news titles.
7. **XNLI**: A cross-lingual sentence representation evaluation dataset.
8. **LCQMC**: A large-scale Chinese question matching corpus.
9. **BQ Corpus**: A domain-specific corpus for sentence semantic equivalence identification.
10. **OCNLI**: A dataset for Chinese natural language inference.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

With these citations gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
