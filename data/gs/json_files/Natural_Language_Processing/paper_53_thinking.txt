To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cost-Sensitive BERT for Generalisable Sentence Classification with Imbalanced Data" by Harish Tayyar Madabushi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their methods on the **Propaganda Techniques Corpus (PTC)**, which is a strong lead for a dataset.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **dataset** sections, specifically **section 3**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the PTC dataset. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of a training set of 350 news articles with over 16,965 sentences, a development set of 61 articles with 2,235 sentences, and a test set of 86 articles with 3,526 sentences. They also highlight the class imbalance within the dataset, which is crucial for understanding its structure and application.

In the **results** section, the authors discuss their performance on the PTC dataset, confirming its significance in their experiments. This reinforces the importance of the dataset in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PTC dataset. The authors reference the original work that introduced the dataset:

- For the **Propaganda Techniques Corpus (PTC)**, the citation is:
  > Giovanni Da San Martino, Seunghak Yu, Alberto Barrón-Cedeño, Rostislav Petrov, and Preslav Nakov. *Fine-grained analysis of propaganda in news articles*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019, Hong Kong, China, November 3-7, 2019.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now prepare to compile the dataset entry for the PTC dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be structured according to the specified format for downstream processing.
