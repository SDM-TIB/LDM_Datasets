To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MULTIQA: An Empirical Investigation of Generalization and Transfer in Reading Comprehension" by Alon Talmor and Jonathan Berant, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper investigates generalization and transfer across multiple reading comprehension datasets, which suggests that several datasets will be discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section** (section 2), where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their investigation. Here, I will look for a list of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as size, context, and question types.

In section 2, the authors categorize the datasets into large and small datasets. They provide a detailed description of each dataset, including:

1. **SQUAD**: A crowdsourced dataset with questions based on Wikipedia paragraphs.
2. **NEWSQA**: A dataset where questions are authored based on CNN articles.
3. **SEARCHQA**: Trivia questions sourced from Jeopardy! with web snippets as context.
4. **TRIVIAQA**: A dataset with trivia questions and various context sources.
5. **HOTPOTQA**: A dataset requiring multi-hop reasoning over related Wikipedia paragraphs.
6. **CQ**: A dataset based on real Google web queries.
7. **CWQ**: A dataset with compositional formal queries against Freebase.
8. **WIKIHOP**: A dataset requiring multi-hop reasoning with entity-relation pairs.
9. **COMQA**: A dataset with questions from the WikiAnswers community.
10. **DROP**: A dataset focusing on quantitative reasoning with questions authored by crowdsourcing workers.

I will also note any specific details provided about each dataset, such as the number of examples, the source of the context, and whether the dataset was designed for multi-hop reasoning.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will extract include:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
