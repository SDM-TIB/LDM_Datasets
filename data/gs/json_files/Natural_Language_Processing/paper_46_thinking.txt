To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards a better understanding of Vector Quantized Autoencoders," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors investigate a training technique for VQ-VAE and references datasets like **CIFAR-10** and **WMT English-German**. This indicates that datasets are indeed present and relevant to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors report their results. They specifically mention using the **WMT’14 English-German** dataset for machine translation tasks. The paper also discusses experiments on the **CIFAR-10** dataset for image reconstruction, which is crucial for understanding the performance of their model.

In the **image reconstruction section**, the authors describe their use of the **SVHN dataset** (Street View House Numbers) for additional experiments. This dataset is also significant as it demonstrates the versatility of their approach across different types of data.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

2. **WMT English-German**:
   > Philipp Koehn, Mosab M. Al-Ayyoub, and others. *The 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation: WMT 2014*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1–12, 2014. URL: http://www.statmt.org/wmt14/.

3. **SVHN**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further study.
