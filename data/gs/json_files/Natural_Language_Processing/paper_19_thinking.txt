To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KU ai at MEDIQA 2019: Domain-specific Pre-training and Transfer Learning for Medical NLI" by Cemil Cengiz, Deniz Yuret, and UlaÅŸ Sert, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **MedNLI dataset** and also refers to **MultiNLI** and **SNLI** datasets for training purposes. This suggests that these datasets are relevant to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **MedNLI**: This dataset is derived from clinical notes and is specifically designed for the task of natural language inference in the medical domain. The authors note that it contains de-identification artifacts due to the nature of the data.

2. **MultiNLI**: A general domain dataset that contains a diverse set of sentence pairs across different genres, which is used to improve the model's reasoning capabilities.

3. **SNLI**: Another general domain dataset that consists of sentence pairs generated from image captions, also used to enhance the model's performance.

In the datasets section, the authors provide a comparison of these datasets, including their sizes and genres, which confirms their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **MedNLI**, the citation is:
  > Romanov, A., & Shivade, C. (2018). Lessons from natural language inference in the clinical domain. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 1586-1596). Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **MultiNLI**, the citation is:
  > Williams, A., Nangia, N., & Bowman, S. (2018). A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers) (pp. 111-121). Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **SNLI**, the citation is:
  > Bowman, S. R., Angeli, S., Potts, C., & Manning, C. D. (2015). A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 632-642). Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for further processing or review.
