To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PoWER-BERT: Accelerating BERT Inference via Progressive Word-vector Elimination" by Saurabh Goyal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **GLUE benchmark** and other datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors provide a table (Table 1) that lists the datasets used for evaluation. This table includes the following datasets:

1. **CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability)**: A dataset for evaluating linguistic acceptability.
2. **RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment)**: A dataset for natural language inference tasks.
3. **QQP (Quora Question Pairs)**: A dataset for paraphrase identification.
4. **MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus)**: Another dataset for paraphrase identification.
5. **SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: A dataset for sentiment analysis.
6. **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: A dataset for natural language inference, with two variants (MNLI-M and MNLI-MM).
7. **QNLI (Question Natural Language Inference)**: A dataset for question answering and natural language inference.
8. **STS-B (Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark)**: A dataset for measuring semantic similarity.
9. **IMDB (Internet Movie Database)**: A dataset for sentiment analysis.
10. **RACE (Reading Comprehension Dataset)**: A dataset for reading comprehension tasks.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
