To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta Answering for Machine Reading" by Benjamin Borschinger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **Natural Questions dataset** for evaluating the machine reading framework, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this case, the **introduction** and **experiments** sections are likely to provide more context about the datasets used. The introduction explicitly states that the authors study the **Natural Questions dataset** (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), which is a key dataset for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any additional datasets that might be referenced. The authors primarily focus on the **Natural Questions dataset**, so I will ensure to gather all relevant details about it.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Natural Questions dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Tom Kwiatkowski, Jennimaria Palomaki, Olivia Redfield, Michael Collins, Ankur Parikh, Chris Alberti, Danielle Epstein, Illia Polosukhin, Matthew Kelcey, Jacob Devlin, Kenton Lee, Kristina N. Toutanova, Llion Jones, Ming-Wei Chang, Andrew Dai, Jakob Uszkoreit, Quoc Le, and Slav Petrov. *Natural Questions: A Benchmark for Question Answering Research*. Transactions of the Association of Computational Linguistics, 2019.

Since the paper primarily discusses the **Natural Questions dataset**, I will create an entry for it, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
