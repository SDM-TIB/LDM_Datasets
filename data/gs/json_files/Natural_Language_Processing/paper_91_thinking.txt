To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HateMonitors: Language Agnostic Abuse Detection in Social Media" by Punyajoy Saha et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a model for Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification in Indo-European Languages (HASOC), which suggests that datasets related to this task are likely included.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset and Task description)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used in their experiments. They mention that the datasets were provided for three languages: Hindi, English, and German, and that they participated in various subtasks related to these datasets.

In **subsection 3.1 (Datasets)**, the authors present statistics for the HASOC dataset, indicating that it includes data for the three languages with different subtasks. They provide a table with the number of training and test samples for each language and subtask, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

The authors also mention that the dataset for the German language is highly unbalanced, while the English and Hindi datasets are more balanced for certain subtasks. This information is important for characterizing the datasets.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the HASOC shared task, which is crucial for citing the dataset correctly. The citation for the HASOC dataset is:

- For the HASOC dataset:
  > Mandl, T., Modha, S., Patel, D., Dave, M., Mandlia, C., Patel, A. (2019). Overview of the HASOC track at FIRE 2019: Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification in Indo-European Languages. In Proceedings of the 11th annual meeting of the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (December 2019).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the HASOC dataset, which is the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
