To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Generalized Framework of Sequence Generation with Application to Undirected Sequence Models" by Elman Mansimov et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of their proposed framework on machine translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental settings section** where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. Here, they mention using the **WMT’14 English-German translation dataset**, which is a well-known benchmark for machine translation tasks. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

In the **data and preprocessing section**, the authors provide more details about the WMT’14 dataset, stating that it consists of 4.5 million parallel sentence pairs. They also mention the preprocessing steps taken, such as tokenization and subword segmentation, which further confirms the dataset's relevance to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the WMT’14 dataset. The citation for the WMT’14 dataset is typically attributed to the original conference proceedings where it was introduced. The relevant citation is:

- For **WMT’14 English-German translation dataset**:
  > Bojar, O., et al. *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1–30, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the WMT’14 dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for any further processing or review.
