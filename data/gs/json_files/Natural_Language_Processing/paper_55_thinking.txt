To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BERT for Evidence Retrieval and Claim Verification" by Amir Soleimani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors are working with the **FEVER dataset**, which is a key dataset for their experiments on evidence retrieval and claim verification.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the FEVER dataset in detail. They mention that the FEVER dataset consists of 185K generated claims labeled as 'SUPPORTED', 'REFUTED', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'. This confirms that the FEVER dataset is central to their research.

In the **methods section**, the authors elaborate on how they utilize the FEVER dataset for their experiments. They describe the dataset's structure and its relevance to their claim verification pipeline. This section reinforces the importance of the FEVER dataset in their work.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the FEVER dataset. The citation is as follows:
- **FEVER Dataset**: 
  > Thorne, J., Vlachos, A., Christodoulopoulos, C., & Mittal, A. (2018). FEVER: a large-scale dataset for fact extraction and verification. *CoRR*, abs/1803.05355.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the **MS MARCO** dataset in relation to their methods, which is also relevant. I will locate its citation in the references section:
- **MS MARCO Dataset**: 
  > Nguyen, T., Rosenberg, M., Song, X., Gao, J., Tiwary, S., Majumder, R., & Deng, L. (2016). MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset. *CoRR*, abs/1611.09268.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified:
1. **FEVER Dataset**: A dataset for evidence-based claim verification with 185K claims.
2. **MS MARCO Dataset**: A dataset used for passage re-ranking in natural language processing tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and attributed to its original source. This structured approach will help in effectively extracting and documenting the datasets from the research paper.
