To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Machine Translation with Byte-Level Subwords" by Changhan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the use of byte-level subwords but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **Experimental Settings** section, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four bilingual corpora and one multilingual dataset:

1. **English-German (En-De)**: The authors replicate the WMT 2014 data, specifically using newstest13 for validation and newstest14 for testing.

2. **Japanese-English (Ja-En)**: This dataset is constructed by concatenating three sources: KFTT, TED, and JESC.

3. **Sinhala-English (Si-En)**: The data for this dataset comes from FLoRes.

4. **Many-to-English (X-En)**: This dataset is based on the TED Talks corpus, which includes parallel data for 59 languages.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **WMT 2014 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bojar, O., et al. *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, 2014.

- For the **KFTT dataset**, the citation is:
  > Neubig, G. *The Kyoto Free Translation Task*. 2011. Available at: http://www.phontron.com/kftt.

- For the **TED dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cettolo, M., Girardi, C., and Federico, M. *WIT3: Web Inventory of Transcribed and Translated Talks*. In Conference of European Association for Machine Translation, 2012.

- For the **JESC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pryzant, R., Chung, Y., Jurafsky, D., and Britz, D. *JESC: Japanese-English Subtitle Corpus*. ArXiv e-prints, 2017.

- For the **FLoRes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Guzm√°n, F., et al. *Two New Evaluation Datasets for Low-Resource Machine Translation: Nepali-English and Sinhala-English*. 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
