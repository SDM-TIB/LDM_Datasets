To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Verbs On Action: An Exploration on Multimodal Learning" by Evin Pinar Ornek, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used. In this case, the introduction discusses the focus on multimodal learning, but I need to look for specific datasets mentioned later in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for the experiments. In **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, the author explicitly lists the datasets utilized:

1. **Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset**: This dataset consists of 400 different human activity classes, with each class containing 10 seconds of video footage. It covers a wide range of activities, including sports and basic body motions.

2. **IAPR TC-12 Dataset**: This dataset includes 200,000 images along with their corresponding captions. The features of these images are extracted using a VGG-128 image recognition network.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kay, W., Carreira, J., Simonyan, K., Zhang, B., Hillier, C., Vijayanarasimhan, S., Viola, F., Green, T., Back, T., Natsev, P., Suleyman, M., & Zisserman, A. (2017). The kinetics human action video dataset. *CoRR*, abs/1705.06950.

- For the **IAPR TC-12 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > (The citation for IAPR TC-12 is not explicitly provided in the text, so I will need to look for it in the references or online if necessary. If it is not available, I will note that the citation is missing.)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the study's findings.
