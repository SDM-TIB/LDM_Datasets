To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning for Causal Sentence Detection" by Manolis Kyriakakis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of both generic public relation extraction datasets and a new biomedical causal sentence detection dataset, indicating that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list and describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will identify each dataset mentioned, along with key details such as the number of samples and the specific focus on causal sentences.

The datasets identified in this section are:

1. **SemEval-2010 (Task 8)**: This dataset contains 10,674 samples, with 1,325 labeled as causal. It is used for multi-way classification of semantic relations between pairs of nominals.

2. **Causal-TimeBank (CausalTB)**: This dataset, as described by Mirza et al. (2014), contains 2,470 sentences, of which 244 are causal. Causal sentences were identified using specific causal signal and link tags.

3. **Event StoryLine (EventSL)**: This dataset includes 4,107 sentences, with 77 identified as causal. Causal sentences were detected based on attributes in the dataset's tags.

4. **BioCausal**: The full biomedical causal detection dataset (BioCausal-Large) consists of 13,342 sentences from PUBMED, with 7,562 labeled as causal. A publicly available subset (BioCausal-Small) contains 2,000 sentences, of which 1,113 are causal.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **SemEval-2010**, the citation is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
