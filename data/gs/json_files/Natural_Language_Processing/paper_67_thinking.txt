To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT" by Omar Khattab and Matei Zaharia, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model using "two recent passage search datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant sections that might describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the **experiments section** (section 4) is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets.

Upon reviewing section 4.1, I find that the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **MS MARCO**: This dataset is described as a collection of 8.8 million passages from web pages, gathered from Bing's results to 1 million real-world queries. It is used for reading comprehension and retrieval tasks.

2. **TREC Complex Answer Retrieval (TREC-CAR)**: This dataset consists of about 29 million passages based on Wikipedia, with queries generated by concatenating the title of a Wikipedia page with the heading of one of its sections.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MS MARCO**, the citation is:
  > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A Human-Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset*. 2016.

- For **TREC CAR**, the citation is:
  > Laura Dietz, Manisha Verma, Filip Radlinski, and Nick Craswell. *TREC Complex Answer Retrieval Overview*. In TREC, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
