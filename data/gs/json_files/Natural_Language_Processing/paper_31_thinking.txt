To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QUASE: Question-Answer Driven Sentence Encoding" by Hangfeng He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of various QA datasets, which indicates that there are multiple datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the motivation behind using QA data for other NLP tasks. They mention several datasets, including **QAMR**, **TriviaQA**, **NewsQA**, **SQuAD**, **QA-RE**, and **Large QA-SRL**. I will take note of these datasets as they are likely to be used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for their evaluations. They specifically mention using **PropBank** for semantic role labeling (SRL), **CoNLL’03** for named entity recognition (NER), and datasets from the SemEval shared tasks for other tasks. I will document these datasets as well.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. Here are the citations I will extract:

1. **QAMR**:
   > Michael et al. (2017). *Crowdsourcing question-answer meaning representations*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods for Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 643–653.

2. **TriviaQA**:
   > Joshi et al. (2017). *TriviaQA: A large scale distantly supervised challenge dataset for reading comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 1601–1611.

3. **NewsQA**:
   > Trischler et al. (2017). *NewsQA: A machine comprehension dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP, pages 191–200.

4. **SQuAD**:
   > Rajpurkar et al. (2016). *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In EMNLP, pages 2383–2392.

5. **QA-RE**:
   > Levy et al. (2017). *Zero-shot relation extraction via reading comprehension*. In CoNLL, pages 333–342.

6. **Large QA-SRL**:
   > FitzGerald et al. (2018). *Large-scale QA-SRL parsing*. In ACL, pages 2051–2060.

7. **PropBank**:
   > Kingsbury and Palmer (2002). *From treebank to propbank*. In LREC, pages 1989–1993.

8. **CoNLL’03**:
   > Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder (2003). *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In NAACL, pages 142–147.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
