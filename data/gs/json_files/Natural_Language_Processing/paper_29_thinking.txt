To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Context Enhanced Multi-Domain Dialogue System for Multi-domain Task Completion" by Jingyuan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the development of a multi-domain dialogue system and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation. This suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the **MultiWOZ dataset** in the **experiments** section, which is crucial for understanding the context of their work. 

In the **experiments section**, they describe the MultiWOZ dataset as follows:
- **MultiWOZ Dataset**: A large-scale multi-domain dialogue dataset containing 10,438 dialogues related to various domains such as attraction, hospital, police, hotel, restaurant, taxi, and train. The dataset is fully annotated and is used to develop their Hierarchical Context Enhanced NLU module.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MultiWOZ dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
- For **MultiWOZ Dataset**:
  > Budzianowski, P.; Wen, T.-H.; Tseng, B.-H.; Casanueva, I.; Ultes, S.; Ramadan, O.; and Gaˇsi´c, M. (2018). *Multiwoz-a large-scale multi-domain wizard-of-oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.00278.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
