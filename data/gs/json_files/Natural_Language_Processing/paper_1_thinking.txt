To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PAWS-X: A Cross-lingual Adversarial Dataset for Paraphrase Identification" by Yinfei Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of **PAWS-X**, which consists of **23,659 human translated PAWS evaluation pairs** in six languages. This indicates that PAWS-X is a dataset that I need to document.

Next, I will look for a dedicated section that discusses datasets in detail. In this case, the **"2 PAWS-X Corpus"** section provides a comprehensive description of the dataset. Here, I will note the key details about PAWS-X, including the number of pairs, the languages involved (French, Spanish, German, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), and the methodology used for creating the dataset.

I will also check the **experiments and results** sections to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or referenced. However, the primary focus here is on the PAWS-X dataset itself.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the original PAWS dataset, which is crucial since PAWS-X is derived from it. The citation for the original PAWS dataset is:
- **PAWS**: 
  > Yuan Zhang, Jason Baldridge, and Luheng He. *PAWS: Paraphrase adversaries from word scrambling*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 1298â€“1308, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since PAWS-X is an extension of the original PAWS dataset, I will ensure to include this citation when documenting PAWS-X.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation for both PAWS-X and the original PAWS dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets extracted from the paper.
