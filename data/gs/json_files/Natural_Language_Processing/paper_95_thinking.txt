To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enriching Word Vectors with Subword Information" by Piotr Bojanowski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their word representations on various tasks across nine different languages, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup** section, particularly **section 4 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention training their models on Wikipedia data in nine languages: Arabic, Czech, German, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Romanian, and Russian. This indicates that the Wikipedia datasets for these languages are used.

I will also check the **results** section, specifically **section 5 (Results)**, where the authors evaluate their model on various datasets. They mention several specific datasets for word similarity and analogy tasks:

1. **WS353**: A dataset introduced by Finkelstein et al. (2001) for word similarity.
2. **RW (Rare Words)**: Introduced by Luong et al. (2013), used for evaluating word representations.
3. **GUR65, GUR350, ZG222**: Datasets for German word similarity introduced by Gurevych (2005) and Zesch and Gurevych (2006).
4. **RG65**: A dataset for French word similarity introduced by Joubarne and Inkpen (2011).
5. **HJ**: A dataset for Russian word vectors introduced by Panchenko et al. (2016).

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **WS353**, the citation is:
  > Lev Finkelstein, Evgeniy Gabrilovich, Yossi Matias, Ehud Rivlin, Zach Solan, Gadi Wolfman, and Eytan Ruppin. *Placing search in context: The concept revisited*. In Proceedings of the International World Wide Web Conference (WWW), 2001.

- For **RW**, the citation is:
  > Minh-Thang Luong, Richard Socher, and Christopher D. Manning. *Better word representations with recursive neural networks for morphology*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), 2013.

- For **GUR65**, **GUR350**, and **ZG222**, the citation is:
  > Iryna Gurevych. *Using the structure of a conceptual network in computing semantic relatedness*. In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP), 2005.

- For **RG65**, the citation is:
  > Colette Joubarne and Diana Inkpen. *Comparison of semantic similarity for different languages using the google n-gram corpus and second-order co-occurrence measures*. In Proceedings of the Canadian Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2011.

- For **HJ**, the citation is:
  > Alexander Panchenko, Dmitry Ustalov, Nikolay Arefyev, Denis Paperno, Natalia Konstantinova, Natalia Loukachevitch, and Chris Biemann. *Human and machine judgements for russian semantic relatedness*. In Proceedings of the AIST, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
