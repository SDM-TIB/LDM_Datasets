To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The MLLP-UPV Spanish-Portuguese and Portuguese-Spanish Machine Translation Systems for WMT19 Similar Language Translation Task" by Pau Baquero-Arnal et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the systems developed, but I need to look for specific datasets in the introduction and later sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention their participation in the WMT 2019 Similar Language Translation Shared Task, which suggests that they used specific datasets for training and evaluation. However, I need to find the exact names of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Baseline systems)**, where the authors describe the training corpora used for their machine translation systems. They mention four specific corpora: **JCR, Europarl, news-commentary, and wikititles**. Each of these corpora is described in terms of the number of sentences, words, and vocabulary size, which is crucial information for understanding the datasets.

I will also check the **table provided in section 3.1 (Corpus description and data preparation)**, which summarizes the statistics of the datasets used. This table confirms the datasets mentioned and provides additional details about their structure.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **JCR Corpus**: The citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, so I will need to search for it in external sources or databases.
2. **Europarl Corpus**: The citation is also not provided, but it is a well-known dataset used in machine translation. I can reference it as:
   > Philipp Koehn. *Europarl: A Parallel Corpus for Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Tenth Machine Translation Summit, pages 79-86, 2005.
3. **news-commentary Corpus**: This dataset is commonly used in translation tasks, but the citation is not provided in the paper. I will need to look it up.
4. **wikititles Corpus**: Similar to the others, this dataset is not cited in the paper, and I will need to find the appropriate reference.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will involve summarizing the key details about each dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that the citations are included for each dataset to maintain academic integrity and facilitate further research.
