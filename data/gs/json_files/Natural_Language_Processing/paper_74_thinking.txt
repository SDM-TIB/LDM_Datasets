To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distantly-Supervised Neural Relation Extraction with Side Information using BERT" by Johny Moreira et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using the **Google Distant Supervision** and **Riedel** datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention the **Google Distant Supervision (GDS)** dataset and the **Riedel dataset**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the paper, the authors describe the **Google Distant Supervision (GDS)** dataset as an extension of the Google relation extraction corpus with additional instances from entity pairs. The **Riedel dataset** is noted to have been developed by aligning Freebase relations with the New York Times corpus, with specific details about the training and test splits.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Google Distant Supervision (GDS)** dataset, the citation is:
  > S. Jat, S. Khandelwal, and P. Talukdar. “Improving Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction using Word and Entity Based Attention”. 2018. Retrieved from http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06987.

- For the **Riedel dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Riedel, L. Yao, and A. McCallum. “Modeling Relations and Their Mentions without Labeled Text”. Proceedings of the 2010 European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases: Part III, pp.148–163.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
