To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Morphology-Aware Word-Segmentation in Dialectal Arabic Adaptation of Neural Machine Translation" by Ahmed Y. Tawfik et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses the use of parallel corpora for machine translation models for dialectal Arabic, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention several parallel resources for Arabic dialects, including:

1. **Crowd sourced translations for Levantine and Egyptian**: This dataset is referenced as LDC2012T09, which is a public dataset for machine translation.

2. **BOLT Egyptian Arabic parallel discussion forums data**: This dataset is identified as LDC2019T01.

3. **Qatari Arabic Corpus**: This dataset includes English translations for several hours of Qatari TV broadcast conversations, but the specific citation is not provided in the text.

4. **Dialectal contents extracted from Arabic subtitles**: This dataset is created using a dialect ID trained fastText language ID model, but again, no specific citation is provided.

5. **Translation of the Egyptian Callhome**: This dataset is referenced as Kumar et al., 2014, which is a crowd-sourced translation of a conversational telephony dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

The citations I will extract are:

- For **Crowd sourced translations for Levantine and Egyptian**:
  > Rabih Zbib, Erika Malchiodi, Jacob Devlin, David Stallard, Spyros Matsoukas, Richard Schwartz, John Makhoul, Omar F. Zaidan, and Chris Callison-Burch. *Machine translation of Arabic dialects*. In Proceedings of the 2012 conference of the North American chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 49â€“59, 2012.

- For **BOLT Egyptian Arabic parallel discussion forums data**:
  > Not explicitly cited in the text, but it is referenced as LDC2019T01.

- For **Translation of the Egyptian Callhome**:
  > Gaurav Kumar, Yuan Cao, Ryan Cotterell, Chris Callison-Burch, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Translations of the Callhome Egyptian Arabic corpus for conversational speech translation*. In Proceedings of International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT), 2014.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
