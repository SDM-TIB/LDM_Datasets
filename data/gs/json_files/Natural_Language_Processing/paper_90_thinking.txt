To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transforming Delete, Retrieve, Generate Approach for Controlled Text Style Transfer" by Akhilesh Sudhakar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method across five datasets, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any section that discusses the datasets used in their experiments. In this case, the **Experiments section** provides a clear overview of the datasets utilized, including their names and descriptions.

Upon reviewing the **Experiments section**, I find that the authors mention five datasets: **YELP, AMAZON, CAPTIONS, POLITICAL, and GENDER**. Each dataset is associated with specific tasks related to sentiment and style transfer. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including the type of data and the style attributes they contain.

Now, I will extract the relevant information for each dataset:

1. **YELP Dataset**: This dataset consists of reviews of businesses on Yelp, labeled as either positive or negative sentiment. 

2. **AMAZON Dataset**: This dataset includes product reviews from Amazon, also labeled as either positive or negative sentiment.

3. **CAPTIONS Dataset**: This dataset contains image captions, with each caption labeled as factual, romantic, or humorous.

4. **POLITICAL Dataset**: This dataset comprises top-level comments on Facebook posts from U.S. Senate and House members, labeled as either Republican or Democrat.

5. **GENDER Dataset**: This dataset consists of food business reviews on Yelp, labeled as either male or female based on gender markers.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For the **YELP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Zhang, Y. Zhao, and Y. Chen. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. 2015. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge.

- For the **AMAZON Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. McAuley and J. Leskovec. *Learning to Rank with Nonsmooth Cost Functions*. In Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2010.

- For the **CAPTIONS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Hodosh, J. Young, and J. Hockenmaier. *Framing Image Descriptions with a Unified Model*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2013.

- For the **POLITICAL Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Voigt, D. Jurgens, V. Prabhakaran, D. Jurafsky, and Y. Tsvetkov. *RtGender: A Corpus for Studying Differential Responses to Gender*. In Proceedings of LREC, 2018.

- For the **GENDER Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Reddy and K. Knight. *Obfuscating Gender in Social Media Writing*. In Proceedings of the First Workshop on NLP and Computational Social Science, 2016.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
