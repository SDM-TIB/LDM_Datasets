To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "DIET: Lightweight Language Understanding for Dialogue Systems" by Tanja Bunk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that DIET advances the state of the art on a complex multi-domain NLU dataset, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Evaluation)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **NLU-Benchmark**: This dataset is described as being annotated with scenarios, actions, and entities, containing 25,716 utterances covering various home assistant tasks. The authors provide a link to access the dataset online.

2. **ATIS**: The ATIS dataset is noted for its use in flight reservation systems, comprising annotated transcripts of audio recordings. The authors reference the original data split used in their experiments and provide a citation for the dataset.

3. **SNIPS**: This dataset is derived from the Snips personal voice assistant and includes 13,784 training and 700 test examples. The authors also provide a citation for this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **NLU-Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Liu, X., Han, X., Eshghi, A., & Rieser, V. (2019). Benchmarking natural language understanding services for building conversational agents. CoRR, abs/1903.05566.

- For **ATIS**, the citation is:
  > Hemphill, C. T., Godfrey, J. J., & Doddington, G. R. (1990). The ATIS spoken language systems pilot corpus. In Speech and Natural Language: Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Hidden Valley, Pennsylvania, June 24-27, 1990.

- For **SNIPS**, the citation is:
  > Coucke, A., Saade, A., Ball, A., Bluche, T., Caulier, A., Leroy, D., ... & Dureau, J. (2018). Snips voice platform: an embedded spoken language understanding system for private-by-design voice interfaces. CoRR, abs/1805.10190.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing.
