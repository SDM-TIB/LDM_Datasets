To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structured Pruning of BERT-based Question Answering Models" by J.S. McCarley, Rishav Chakravarti, and Avirup Sil, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their methods on SQuAD 2.0 and Natural Questions, which indicates that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **subsection 4.1**, they explicitly state that they evaluate their proposed method on two benchmark QA datasets: **SQuAD 2.0** and **Natural Questions (NQ)**. This confirms that these are the datasets utilized for their research.

In **subsection 4.2**, they provide details about SQuAD 2.0, describing it as a dataset of questions from Wikipedia passages, created by human annotators. They also mention that Natural Questions consists of Google search queries with answers from Wikipedia pages, also annotated by humans. This gives me a clear understanding of the nature of these datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SQuAD 2.0**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Robin Jia, and Percy Liang. *Know what you don’t know: Unanswerable questions for SQuAD*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers), pages 784–789, Melbourne, Australia, 2018.

- For **Natural Questions**, the citation is:
  > Tom Kwiatkowski, Jennimaria Palomaki, Olivia Redfield, Michael Collins, Ankur Parikh, Chris Alberti, Danielle Epstein, Illia Polosukhin, Matthew Kelcey, Jacob Devlin, Kenton Lee, Kristina N. Toutanova, Llion Jones, Ming-Wei Chang, Andrew Dai, Jakob Uszkoreit, Quoc Le, and Slav Petrov. *Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research*. Transactions of the Association of Computational Linguistics, 2019.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations. I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
