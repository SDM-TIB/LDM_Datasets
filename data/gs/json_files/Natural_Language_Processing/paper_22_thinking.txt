To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QE BERT: Bilingual BERT using Multi-task Learning for Neural Quality Estimation" by Hyun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimentation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed model was evaluated on the **WMT19 QE datasets**, which indicates that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets in the **experimentation section**. In this section, the authors specify that they used parallel data provided for the WMT19 news machine translation task. They mention two specific language pairs for which the datasets were used:

1. **English-Russian Parallel Data**: This dataset consists of multiple sources, including the ParaCrawl corpus, Common Crawl corpus, News Commentary corpus, and Yandex Corpus.

2. **English-German Parallel Data**: This dataset also comprises several sources, including the Europarl corpus, ParaCrawl corpus, Common Crawl corpus, News Commentary corpus, and Document-split Rapid corpus.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from multiple sources, I will need to cite each source individually.

For the **ParaCrawl corpus**, the citation is:
> ParaCrawl. *ParaCrawl: A Large-Scale Parallel Corpus for Machine Translation*. Available at: https://paracrawl.eu/

For the **Common Crawl corpus**, the citation is:
> Common Crawl. *Common Crawl: A Non-Profit Organization that crawls the web and freely provides its archives and datasets to the public*. Available at: https://commoncrawl.org/

For the **News Commentary corpus**, the citation is:
> News Commentary. *News Commentary: A Parallel Corpus for Machine Translation*. Available at: http://www.statmt.org/wmt19/translation-task.html

For the **Yandex Corpus**, the citation is:
> Yandex. *Yandex Translation Corpus*. Available at: https://translate.yandex.com/corpora

For the **Europarl corpus**, the citation is:
> Koehn, P. *Europarl: A Parallel Corpus for Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Tenth Machine Translation Summit, pages 79â€“86, Phuket, Thailand, 2005.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be clearly described along with its full citation to ensure proper attribution.
