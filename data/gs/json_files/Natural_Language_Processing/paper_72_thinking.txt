To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Literary Event Detection" by Matthew Sims et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a new dataset of literary events, which indicates that there is a dataset to extract. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset's purpose and context, suggesting that it is a significant part of the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **data** within the paper. In this case, I find that **section 3 (Data)** provides detailed information about the dataset. The authors describe the dataset as consisting of event annotations in literary texts, specifically mentioning that it includes 210,532 tokens from 100 books. This section also states that the dataset is freely available for download under a Creative Commons ShareAlike 4.0 license, which is important for understanding its accessibility.

The paper also references the **Project Gutenberg corpus** as the source of the literary works used for annotation. This is crucial information as it provides context about the dataset's origin.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper indicates that the dataset is part of LitBank, which is hosted on GitHub. Therefore, I will note the citation for the dataset as follows:

- **LitBank Dataset**: 
  > Matthew Sims, Jong Ho Park, and David Bamman. *Literary Event Detection*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 3623â€“3634, Florence, Italy, July 28 - August 2, 2019. Association for Computational Linguistics. Available at: https://github.com/dbamman/litbank.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset extracted from the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
