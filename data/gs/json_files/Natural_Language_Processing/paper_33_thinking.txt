To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combating Adversarial Misspellings with Robust Word Recognition" by Danish Pruthi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a word recognition model and its evaluation against various adversarial attacks, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Word Error Correction)**, where the authors describe their evaluation setup. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: This dataset consists of 8,544 movie reviews and has a vocabulary of over 16,000 words. It is used for evaluating the spell correctors in the context of sentiment analysis.

2. **IMDB Movie Reviews**: This dataset contains 54,000 movie reviews and has a vocabulary of over 78,000 words. It serves as a background corpus for the experiments.

In **subsection 4.2 (Robustness to Adversarial Attacks)**, the authors mention that they use the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)** for sentiment classification tasks, confirming its role in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2011.

- For the **IMDB Movie Reviews**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2011.

Even though the IMDB dataset is not explicitly cited in the references, it is commonly known in the NLP community, and the authors refer to it in the context of their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
