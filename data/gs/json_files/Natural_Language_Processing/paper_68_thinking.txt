To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enriching the Transformer with Linguistic Factors for Low-Resource Machine Translation" by Jordi Armengol-Estapé et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on low-resource datasets, specifically mentioning the **IWSLT German-to-English task** and the **FLoRes English-to-Nepali benchmark**. This suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look into the **experimental framework and results section** (section 4) for detailed descriptions of these datasets. Here, the authors provide specific information about the datasets used:

1. **IWSLT14 Dataset**: This dataset is described as a low-resource dataset for the German-to-English translation task, containing approximately 160,000 sentences. The authors reference the original work by Mauro Cettolo et al. (2014) for the dataset.

2. **FLoRes Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as the English-to-Nepali translation benchmark, which includes 564,000 parallel sentences. The authors cite the work by Francisco Guzmán et al. (2019) for this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **IWSLT14 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mauro Cettolo, Jan Niehues, Sebastian Stüker, Luisa Bentivogli, and Marcello Federico. *Report on the 11th iwslt evaluation campaign, iwslt 2014*. In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, Hanoi, Vietnam, page 57, 2014.

- For the **FLoRes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Francisco Guzmán, Peng-Jen Chen, Myle Ott, Juan Pino, Guillaume Lample, Philipp Koehn, Vishrav Chaudhary, and Marc’Aurelio Ranzato. *Two new evaluation datasets for low-resource machine translation: Nepali-english and sinhala-english*. CoRR, abs/1902.01382, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper. I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation for future reference or use.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
