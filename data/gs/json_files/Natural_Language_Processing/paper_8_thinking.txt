To extract datasets from the research paper titled "XQA: A Cross-lingual Open-domain Question Answering Dataset" by Jiahua Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the construction of a novel dataset called **XQA** for cross-lingual OpenQA research, which indicates that this is the primary dataset of interest. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset's structure, including its training, development, and test sets across multiple languages.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant subsections. In this paper, **section 4 (The XQA Dataset)** provides detailed information about the dataset. Here, I will note the specifics of the dataset, including the number of question-answer pairs and the languages involved.

The XQA dataset consists of:
- A training set in English with **56,279 question-answer pairs**.
- Development and test sets in multiple languages, including English, French, German, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Chinese, Tamil, and Ukrainian, with varying numbers of question-answer pairs.

I will also check the **statistics** provided in the paper, which detail the number of questions in each language for the development and test sets. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the XQA dataset. The paper does not provide a separate citation for the dataset itself, but it is essential to reference the paper where the dataset is introduced. Therefore, I will use the following citation for the XQA dataset:

> Jiahua Liu, Yankai Lin, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun. *XQA: A Cross-lingual Open-domain Question Answering Dataset*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 2358â€“2368, Florence, Italy, July 28 - August 2, 2019.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a clear and comprehensive record of the dataset extracted from the paper.
