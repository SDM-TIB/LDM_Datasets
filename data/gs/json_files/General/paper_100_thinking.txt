To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Reinforced Generation of Adversarial Examples for Neural Machine Translation" by Wei Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on various neural machine translation architectures, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data Sets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention training their agent using parallel data for different translation tasks. The specific datasets mentioned are:

1. **LDC (Linguistic Data Consortium) datasets** for German to English (De→En) translation, which includes 4.5 million pairs.
2. **WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation) datasets** for English to French (En→Fr) and English to German (En→De) translation tasks, with 2.2 million pairs for En→Fr and 1.3 million pairs for En→De.

In this section, the authors also describe the preprocessing steps, such as applying byte pair encoding (BPE) for subword level translation, which indicates the datasets are substantial and well-structured.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not be explicitly listed for the datasets themselves, but I can infer them based on the context provided in the paper. 

For the **LDC datasets**, the citation is typically:
> LDC. *Linguistic Data Consortium*. Various datasets available at: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/

For the **WMT datasets**, the citation is generally:
> WMT. *Workshop on Machine Translation*. Various datasets available at: http://www.statmt.org/wmt/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
