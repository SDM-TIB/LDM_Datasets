To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Generalized Framework of Sequence Generation with Application to Undirected Sequence Models" by Elman Mansimov et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of their framework on WMT’14 English-German translation, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experimental settings section**. Here, the authors state that they evaluate their framework on the **WMT’14 English-German translation dataset**, which consists of 4.5 million parallel sentence pairs. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

I will also check the **data and preprocessing section** for any additional details about the dataset. The authors mention that they preprocess the WMT’14 dataset by tokenizing each sentence and segmenting words into subword units using byte pair encoding. This confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the WMT’14 dataset. The citation for the WMT dataset is typically attributed to the original WMT conference papers, but I will ensure to provide the most relevant citation for the dataset used in this context.

The citation for the WMT’14 dataset is:
> Bojar, O., et al. *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1–30, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
