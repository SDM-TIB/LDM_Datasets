To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards a better understanding of Vector Quantized Autoencoders," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved results on datasets such as **CIFAR-10**, which indicates that datasets are indeed discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors detail their experiments. Here, they specifically mention using the **WMT English-German translation dataset** and the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their evaluations. This is crucial as it confirms the datasets used in their experiments.

In the **image reconstruction section** (Section A), the authors also refer to the **SVHN dataset** (Street View House Numbers) for additional experiments, which is another dataset to document.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

2. **WMT English-German translation dataset**:
   > Philipp Koehn, Christof Monz, and others. *The 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1â€“12, 2014. URL: http://www.statmt.org/wmt14/.

3. **SVHN dataset**:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, volume 2011, pp. 5, 2011. URL: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **WMT English-German translation dataset**: A dataset used for training and evaluating machine translation systems, containing parallel text in English and German.
3. **SVHN dataset**: A dataset of over 600,000 digit images collected from house numbers in Google Street View images.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
