To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Literary Event Detection" by Matthew Sims et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a new dataset of literary events, which indicates that there is a dataset to extract. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset, stating that it consists of event annotations in literary texts.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **data** within the paper. In this case, the relevant information is found in **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors describe the corpus they annotated. They mention that the dataset comprises 210,532 tokens from 100 literary works, which were selected from the Project Gutenberg corpus.

The authors also provide a link to access the dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes. They state that the dataset is freely available under a Creative Commons ShareAlike 4.0 license as part of LitBank, and they provide the URL: https://github.com/dbamman/litbank.

Now, I will ensure to gather the full citation for the dataset. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but it references the works included in the dataset, which are public domain literary texts. Therefore, I will cite the Project Gutenberg as the source of the texts used in the dataset.

The citation for the Project Gutenberg corpus is:
> Project Gutenberg. *Project Gutenberg: Free eBooks*. Available at: https://www.gutenberg.org/

Additionally, I will note that the dataset is based on the annotation guidelines adapted from ACE 2005 and Light ERE, which are also referenced in the paper. However, since the focus is on the dataset itself, I will primarily cite the LitBank repository and Project Gutenberg.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citations as required.

After completing these steps, I will have a clear and structured entry for the dataset extracted from the paper, ready for further processing or review.
