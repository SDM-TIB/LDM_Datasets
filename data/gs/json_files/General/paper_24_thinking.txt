To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Layer Normalization in the Transformer Architecture" by Ruibin Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not detail specific datasets. The introduction may reference datasets used in prior work, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **IWSLT14 German-to-English (De-En) dataset**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks. The authors mention that it contains about 153K training pairs, 7K validation pairs, and 7K test pairs.

2. **WMT14 English-to-German (En-De) dataset**: This dataset is also used for machine translation and consists of approximately 4.5M training parallel sentence pairs.

3. **BookCorpus**: This dataset is used for unsupervised pre-training and is mentioned as being collected from various sources, containing roughly 3.4 billion words.

4. **Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC)**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of models on the paraphrase detection task.

5. **Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE)**: This dataset is used for the textual entailment task, which involves determining whether one sentence entails another.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications.
