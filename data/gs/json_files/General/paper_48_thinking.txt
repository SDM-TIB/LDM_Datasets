To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "How to Fine-Tune BERT for Text Classification?" by Chi Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on eight widely-studied text classification datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets and provide statistics for each one. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **IMDb**: A binary sentiment analysis dataset containing 50,000 reviews (25,000 for training and 25,000 for testing).
2. **Yelp Polarity (Yelp P.)**: A binary sentiment analysis dataset with 560,000 reviews (28,000 for testing).
3. **Yelp Full (Yelp F.)**: A five-class sentiment analysis dataset with 650,000 reviews (50,000 for testing).
4. **TREC**: A question classification dataset with 5,452 questions (500 for testing).
5. **Yahoo! Answers**: A question classification dataset with 1,400,000 questions (60,000 for testing).
6. **AG’s News**: A topic classification dataset with 120,000 articles (7,600 for testing).
7. **DBPedia**: A topic classification dataset with 560,000 articles (70,000 for testing).
8. **Sogou News**: A Chinese topic classification dataset with 54,000 articles (6,000 for testing).

In the **data statistics table (Table 1)**, the authors provide additional details about each dataset, including the number of classes, average and maximum lengths of documents, and the exceeding ratio of document lengths over the BERT input limit of 512 tokens.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

With this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and proper attribution.
