To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-label Categorization of Accounts of Sexism using a Neural Framework" by Pulkit Parikh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the authors have created the "largest dataset for sexism categorization," which suggests that a specific dataset is central to their research. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset, stating that it comprises **13,023 accounts of sexism** tagged with **23 categories**.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of the dataset in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the paper, the authors describe the dataset construction process in **section 3 (Dataset Construction)**. Here, they detail how they collected accounts from the **Everyday Sexism Project website** and the annotation process involving ten annotators. This section provides critical information about the dataset's size, source, and the categories used for labeling.

The dataset is explicitly named as the **"Multi-label Sexism Categorization Dataset,"** which is a significant finding. I will note the details provided about the dataset, including the number of accounts, the categories, and the source of the data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Everyday Sexism Project, which is the source of the dataset. The citation is not provided in a standard format in the paper, so I will summarize the information based on the context given in the text.

The citation for the Everyday Sexism Project is:
> Everyday Sexism Project. *Everyday Sexism Project*. Available at: https://everydaysexism.com

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation. The dataset entry will look like this:

1. **Dataset Name**: Multi-label Sexism Categorization Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset comprising 13,023 accounts of sexism, including first-person accounts from survivors, each tagged with at least one of 23 categories of sexism. The accounts are drawn from the Everyday Sexism Project website.
   - **Citation**: Everyday Sexism Project. *Everyday Sexism Project*. Available at: https://everydaysexism.com

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is clearly presented and ready for any further processing or review.
