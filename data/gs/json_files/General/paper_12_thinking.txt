To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DSTC8-AVSD: Multimodal Semantic Transformer Network with Retrieval Style Word Generator" by Hwanhee Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the Audio Visual Scene-aware Dialog (AVSD) task, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this task.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as it typically contains information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention the performance of their model on the **DSTC7** and **DSTC8** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experimental results.

I will then look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors report model performance on the DSTC datasets, which are organized into different versions (single reference and six references). This confirms that both DSTC7 and DSTC8 are datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **DSTC7**, the citation is:
  > Alamri, H.; Cartillier, V.; Lopes, R. G.; Das, A.; Wang, J.; Essa, I.; Batra, D.; Parikh, D.; Cherian, A.; Marks, T. K.; et al. 2018. Audio visual scene-aware dialog (avsd) challenge at dstc7. arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.00525.

- For **DSTC8**, the citation is:
  > Kim, S.; Galley, M.; Gunasekara, C.; Lee, S.; Atkinson, A.; Peng, B.; Schulz, H.; Gao, J.; Li, J.; Adada, M.; et al. 2019. The eighth dialog system technology challenge. arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.06394.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets used in the paper:

1. **DSTC7**: This dataset is used for the AVSD task and is part of the challenge organized at the 7th Dialog System Technology Challenge.
2. **DSTC8**: This dataset is also used for the AVSD task and is part of the challenge organized at the 8th Dialog System Technology Challenge.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are critical for proper attribution.
