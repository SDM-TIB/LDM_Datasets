To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT" by Omar Khattab and Matei Zaharia, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on "two recent passage search datasets." This indicates that there are specific datasets used in their experiments, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets in **section 4.1 (Methodology)**, where they describe the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **MS MARCO**: This dataset is introduced as a collection of 8.8 million passages from web pages, gathered from Bingâ€™s results to 1 million real-world queries. It is used for reading comprehension and retrieval tasks.

2. **TREC Complex Answer Retrieval (TREC-CAR)**: This dataset consists of about 29 million passages based on Wikipedia, with queries generated by concatenating the title of a Wikipedia page with the heading of one of its sections.

I will then confirm the details of these datasets by checking the **experiments section** where they are referenced again, ensuring that I have the correct context and usage of each dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MS MARCO**, the citation is:
  > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A Human-Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset*. (2016).

- For **TREC CAR**, the citation is:
  > Laura Dietz, Manisha Verma, Filip Radlinski, and Nick Craswell. *TREC Complex Answer Retrieval Overview*. In TREC. (2017).

Now that I have gathered all necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any critical details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
