To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Global Entity Disambiguation with BERT" by Ikuya Yamada et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving state-of-the-art results on **five standard ED datasets**: AIDA-CoNLL, MSNBC, AQUAINT, ACE2004, and WNED-WIKI. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In section 4, they mention the same five datasets again, confirming their importance in the study. Additionally, they introduce **WNED-CWEB** as another dataset used in their experiments, bringing the total to six datasets.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of each dataset from the text. The authors provide statistics about the datasets in **Appendix C**, which will be useful for understanding their characteristics.

1. **AIDA-CoNLL**: This dataset is used for entity disambiguation tasks and is a well-known benchmark in the field.
2. **MSNBC**: Another dataset used for evaluating entity disambiguation models, often used in conjunction with AIDA-CoNLL.
3. **AQUAINT**: This dataset is also utilized for entity disambiguation and is part of the standard benchmarks.
4. **ACE2004**: A dataset that includes various entity types and is used for evaluating entity recognition and disambiguation.
5. **WNED-WIKI**: This dataset is derived from Wikipedia and is used for entity disambiguation tasks.
6. **WNED-CWEB**: This dataset is also derived from Wikipedia and is used for entity disambiguation, providing additional context for evaluation.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
