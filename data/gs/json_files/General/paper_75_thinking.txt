To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning for a Music Glove Instrument" by Joseph Bakarji, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the collection of data from a performer using the glove while playing an electric keyboard, but it does not specify any named datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, particularly the **literature review** subsection, to identify any references to existing datasets used in related works. However, this section primarily discusses previous works without naming specific datasets.

Moving on to the **data collection** subsection in **section 2.3.1**, I will look for any details about the data collected during the experiments. The author mentions that data is collected from a MIDI keyboard and glove micro-controller, but again, no specific datasets are named.

In the **results** section, I will check for any references to datasets used for training and testing the models. The author discusses various performance complexities and accuracy metrics but does not provide specific dataset names.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references include various works related to glove sensors and music interaction, but they do not explicitly mention datasets.

Since the paper does not provide specific named datasets, I will summarize the data collection method instead. The data consists of sensor readings from the glove and MIDI input from the keyboard, but it lacks formal dataset citations.

In conclusion, while I have thoroughly searched the paper for datasets, it appears that the author did not reference any formal datasets with citations. Instead, the data is described as being collected from the glove and keyboard during performance, which does not meet the criteria for dataset extraction as specified.

Therefore, I will note that no formal datasets were identified in this paper, and I will document the data collection method as described by the author without specific citations.
