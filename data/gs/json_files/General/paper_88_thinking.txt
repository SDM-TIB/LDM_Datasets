To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Captioning through Image Transformer" by Sen He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on the **MSCOCO image captioning dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they explicitly state that their model is trained on the **MSCOCO image captioning dataset** and provide specifics about the dataset, including the number of images in the training, validation, and test sets, as well as the number of captions per image.

In this section, the authors mention that they follow **Karpathy’s splits** for the MSCOCO dataset, which is a common practice in image captioning research. This confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **MSCOCO dataset** from the **References section** of the paper. The citation is as follows:
> Chen, X., Fang, H., Lin, T.Y., Vedantam, R., Gupta, S., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. (2015). *Microsoft coco captions: Data collection and evaluation server*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00325.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MSCOCO dataset for its experiments, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citation, into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately.
