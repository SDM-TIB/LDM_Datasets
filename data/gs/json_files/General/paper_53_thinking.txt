To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cost-Sensitive BERT for Generalisable Sentence Classification with Imbalanced Data" by Harish Tayyar Madabushi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **Propaganda Techniques Corpus (PTC)** for testing their methods, which indicates that this is a key dataset. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges of imbalanced classification and mentions the PTC again, confirming its significance in the study.

Next, I will look into the **Datasets section** (Section 3) where the authors provide detailed information about the PTC. Here, they describe the dataset's composition, including the number of articles and sentences, as well as the class distribution of propaganda versus non-propaganda sentences. This section is crucial as it provides the specifics needed to describe the dataset accurately.

In Section 3, the authors state that the PTC consists of:
- A training set of **350 news articles** with **16,965 total sentences**.
- A development set of **61 articles** with **2,235 total sentences**.
- A test set of **86 articles** with **3,526 total sentences**.

They also highlight the class imbalance, noting that approximately **28%** of the sentences are labeled as propaganda.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PTC. The authors reference the original work that introduced the dataset, which is by Da San Martino et al. (2019). The citation I need to extract is:

> Giovanni Da San Martino, Seunghak Yu, Alberto Barr칩n-Cede침o, Rostislav Petrov, and Preslav Nakov. *Fine-grained analysis of propaganda in news articles*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019, Hong Kong, China, November 3-7, 2019.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the dataset, I will summarize it as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Propaganda Techniques Corpus (PTC)
   - **Description**: A dataset for fine-grained propaganda detection, consisting of labeled sentences from news articles.
   - **Size**: 
     - Training set: 350 articles, 16,965 sentences
     - Development set: 61 articles, 2,235 sentences
     - Test set: 86 articles, 3,526 sentences
   - **Class Distribution**: Approximately 28% propaganda, 72% non-propaganda.

2. **Full Citation**: 
   > Giovanni Da San Martino, Seunghak Yu, Alberto Barr칩n-Cede침o, Rostislav Petrov, and Preslav Nakov. *Fine-grained analysis of propaganda in news articles*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019, Hong Kong, China, November 3-7, 2019.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the dataset details and citations are clear and complete.
