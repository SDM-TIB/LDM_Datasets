To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Large-Scale Document-Level Neural Machine Translation" by Marcin Junczys-Dowmunt, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the focus on document-level neural machine translation, but I need to look for specific datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Data and Data Preparation)**, where the author discusses the types of data used for training the models. Here, I will look for any named datasets or descriptions of the data sources. The author mentions using subsets of parallel data such as **Europarl, Rapid, and News-Commentary**, which are important for the document-level translation tasks.

In **subsection 3.1.1 (Document-level Mark-up)**, the author describes how document boundaries are utilized, which indicates the use of specific datasets that contain these boundaries. I will note these datasets as they are crucial for the experiments.

Additionally, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The author cites various works that may provide context or details about the datasets used.

For example, the **Europarl dataset** is often referenced in machine translation literature, and I will ensure to include its citation. The citation for the Europarl dataset is:
> Philipp Koehn. *Europarl: A Parallel Corpus for Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Tenth Machine Translation Summit, pages 79–86, 2005.

The **Rapid dataset** and **News-Commentary dataset** are also commonly used in translation tasks, and I will look for their citations as well. The citation for the News-Commentary dataset is:
> Matt Post. *A Call for Clarity in Reporting BLEU Scores*. In Proceedings of the Third Conference on Machine Translation: Research Papers, pages 186–191, 2018.

After gathering all the relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that full citations are provided for each one.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
