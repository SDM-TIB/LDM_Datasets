To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer-based Automatic Post-Editing Model with Joint Encoder and Multi-source Attention of Decoder" by WonKee Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **WMT19 English-German APE dataset** and the **eSCAPE NMT dataset**, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 3.1, the authors explicitly mention using the **WMT19 official English-German APE dataset** (Chatterjee et al., 2018) and the **eSCAPE NMT dataset** (Negri et al., 2018). They provide some statistics about the datasets, such as the number of sentence triplets and the TER scores, which will be useful for describing the datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**:

1. For the **WMT19 English-German APE dataset**, the citation is:
   > Rajen Chatterjee, Matteo Negri, Raphael Rubino, and Marco Turchi. *Findings of the WMT 2018 Shared Task on Automatic Post-Editing*. In Proceedings of the Third Conference on Machine Translation: Shared Task Papers, page 710-725, 2018.

2. For the **eSCAPE NMT dataset**, the citation is:
   > Matteo Negri, Marco Turchi, Rajen Chatterjee, and Nicola Bertoldi. *ESCAPE: a Large-scale Synthetic Corpus for Automatic Post-Editing*. In International Proceedings of Conference and Evaluation (LREC-2018).

With these citations, I can now summarize the datasets:

- **WMT19 English-German APE dataset**: This dataset consists of a training set and a development set used for automatic post-editing tasks.
- **eSCAPE NMT dataset**: This dataset is a large-scale synthetic corpus designed for automatic post-editing, which the authors filtered to create a more relevant training set.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
