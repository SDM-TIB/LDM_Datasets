To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QUASE: Question-Answer Driven Sentence Encoding" by Hangfeng He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various QA datasets, which suggests that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the motivation for using QA data. They mention several datasets, including **QAMR**, **TriviaQA**, **NewsQA**, **SQuAD**, **QA-RE**, and **Large QA-SRL**. I will note these down as potential datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more details about how these datasets are used. They specifically mention using **QAMR** for further pre-training and evaluate their model on tasks related to **SRL**, **NER**, **RE**, and **MRC**. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. Here are the citations I will extract:

1. **QAMR**:
   > Michael et al. (2017). *Crowdsourcing question-answer meaning representations*. NAACL.

2. **TriviaQA**:
   > Joshi et al. (2017). *TriviaQA: A large scale distantly supervised challenge dataset for reading comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1601–1611.

3. **NewsQA**:
   > Trischler et al. (2017). *NewsQA: A machine comprehension dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP, pages 191–200.

4. **SQuAD**:
   > Rajpurkar et al. (2016). *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In EMNLP, pages 2383–2392.

5. **QA-RE**:
   > Levy et al. (2017). *Zero-shot relation extraction via reading comprehension*. In CoNLL, pages 333–342.

6. **Large QA-SRL**:
   > FitzGerald et al. (2018). *Large-scale QA-SRL parsing*. In ACL, pages 2051–2060.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
