To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning in Biomedical Named Entity Recognition: An Evaluation of BERT in the PharmaCoNER task" by Cong Sun and Zhihao Yang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **PharmaCoNER corpus**, which is a strong indication that this is a dataset relevant to the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Results and Discussion)**, where the authors provide details about the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they describe the **PharmaCoNER corpus**, which has been divided into three subsets: a training set with 500 clinical cases, and both a development set and a test set with 250 clinical cases each. This section confirms the dataset's structure and its relevance to the experiments conducted.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PharmaCoNER dataset. The authors reference the original work related to the PharmaCoNER task, which is crucial for providing the correct citation.

The citation for the PharmaCoNER dataset is:
> Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre, Montserrat Marimon, Ander Intxaurrondo, Obdulia Rabal, Marta Villegas, and Martin Krallinger. *PharmaCoNER: Pharmacological substances, compounds and proteins named entity recognition track*. In Proceedings of the BioNLP Open Shared Tasks (BioNLP-OST), 2019.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the PharmaCoNER corpus, ready for structured output or further processing.
