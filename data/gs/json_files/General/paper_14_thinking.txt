To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting BERT for End-to-End Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis" by Xin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on the E2E-ABSA task, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors discuss their experimental setup. In this section, they explicitly mention using two datasets: **LAPTOP** and **REST**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their statistics, which are summarized in Table 3.

The paper states the following about the datasets:

1. **LAPTOP Dataset**: 
   - Contains 4245 total sentences, with 304 training sentences, 256 development sentences, and 800 test sentences.
   - The dataset has 2741 aspects in total.

2. **REST Dataset**: 
   - Contains 6035 total sentences, with 387 training sentences, 413 development sentences, and 2158 test sentences.
   - The dataset has 3490 aspects in total.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the SemEval ABSA challenges for these datasets, so I will locate the appropriate citations.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **LAPTOP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maria Pontiki, Dimitris Galanis, Haris Papageorgiou, Suresh Manandhar, and Ion Androutsopoulos. *SemEval-2014 task 4: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In SemEval, pages 27–35, 2014.

- For the **REST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maria Pontiki, Dimitris Galanis, John Pavlopoulos, Ion Androutsopoulos, and Harris Papageorgiou. *SemEval-2015 task 12: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In SemEval, pages 486–495, 2015.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
