To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combating Adversarial Misspellings with Robust Word Recognition" by Danish Pruthi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a word recognition model to combat adversarial spelling mistakes, which suggests that datasets related to text classification or sentiment analysis may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors discuss their experimental setup. In **section 4.1 (Word Error Correction)**, they mention evaluating their models on two specific datasets:

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: This dataset consists of 8,544 movie reviews and is used for sentiment analysis. The authors note that it has a vocabulary of over 16,000 words.

2. **IMDB Movie Reviews**: This dataset contains 54,000 movie reviews and has a vocabulary of over 78,000 words. It is used as a background corpus for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about how they evaluate their models using these datasets, confirming their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**, the citation is:
  > Socher, Richard, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. "Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank." In *Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)*, 2013.

- For the **IMDB Movie Reviews**, the citation is:
  > Maas, Andrew L., Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. "Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis." In *Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)*, 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
