To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structured Pruning of BERT-based Question Answering Models" by J.S. McCarley, Rishav Chakravarti, and Avirup Sil, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on specific datasets, which suggests that there are datasets to extract.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference two key datasets used in their experiments: **SQuAD 2.0** and **Natural Questions (NQ)**. They describe SQuAD 2.0 as a dataset of questions from Wikipedia passages, while NQ consists of Google search queries with answers from Wikipedia pages. This gives me the names of the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. They confirm that they used **SQuAD 2.0** and **Natural Questions** for their evaluations. This section provides additional context about the datasets, including their purpose and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **SQuAD 2.0**, the citation is:
   > Pranav Rajpurkar, Robin Jia, and Percy Liang. *Know what you don’t know: Unanswerable questions for SQuAD*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers), pages 784–789, Melbourne, Australia, 2018.

2. For **Natural Questions (NQ)**, the citation is:
   > Tom Kwiatkowski, Jennimaria Palomaki, Olivia Redfield, Michael Collins, Ankur Parikh, Chris Alberti, Danielle Epstein, Illia Polosukhin, Matthew Kelcey, Jacob Devlin, Kenton Lee, Kristina N. Toutanova, Llion Jones, Ming-Wei Chang, Andrew Dai, Jakob Uszkoreit, Quoc Le, and Slav Petrov. *Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research*. Transactions of the Association of Computational Linguistics, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
