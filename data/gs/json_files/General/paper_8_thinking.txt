To extract datasets from the research paper titled "XQA: A Cross-lingual Open-domain Question Answering Dataset" by Jiahua Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the construction of a novel dataset called **XQA** for cross-lingual OpenQA research, which indicates that this is the primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for a dedicated section that discusses the dataset in detail. In this case, **section 4 (The XQA Dataset)** provides comprehensive information about the dataset. Here, I will note the key details:

1. **XQA Dataset**: The paper states that the XQA dataset consists of a training set in English and development and test sets in eight other languages (French, German, Portuguese, Polish, Chinese, Russian, Ukrainian, and Tamil). The training set contains 56,279 English question-answer pairs, while the development and test sets contain 17,358 and 16,973 question-answer pairs, respectively.

I will also gather additional context about how the dataset was constructed, which includes the use of Wikipedia's "Did you know" section for question generation and the retrieval of relevant documents.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** for the full citation of the dataset. However, since the XQA dataset is introduced in this paper and does not reference another source for its creation, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the XQA dataset will be:
> Jiahua Liu, Yankai Lin, Zhiyuan Liu, and Maosong Sun. *XQA: A Cross-lingual Open-domain Question Answering Dataset*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 2358â€“2368, Florence, Italy, July 28 - August 2, 2019.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into the required format for further processing. This includes ensuring that I have captured all relevant details about the dataset's structure, language coverage, and the number of question-answer pairs in each set.
