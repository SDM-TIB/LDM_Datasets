To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Simple but Effective Method to Incorporate Multi-turn Context with BERT for Conversational Machine Comprehension" by Yasuhito Ohsugi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to experiments conducted on **two conversational machine comprehension datasets**, specifically **QuAC** and **CoQA**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will delve into the **introduction section**, where the authors explicitly mention both datasets: "Recently, two datasets, QuAC (Choi et al., 2018) and CoQA (Reddy et al., 2018), were released to answer sequential questions in a dialogue by comprehending a paragraph." This confirms their relevance to the study.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss their evaluation on both datasets, providing further context on how they were utilized. They mention that their method outperformed existing methods on both QuAC and CoQA, reinforcing the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **QuAC**, the citation is:
   > Eunsol Choi, He He, Mohit Iyyer, Mark Yatskar, Wentao Yih, Yejin Choi, Percy Liang, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *QuAC: Question Answering in Context*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2174â€“2184, 2018. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. For **CoQA**, the citation is:
   > Siva Reddy, Danqi Chen, and Christopher D. Manning. *CoQA: A Conversational Question Answering Challenge*. CoRR, abs/1808.07042, 2018.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or application of the research findings.
