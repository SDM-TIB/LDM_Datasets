To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The MLLP-UPV Spanish-Portuguese and Portuguese-Spanish Machine Translation Systems for WMT19 Similar Language Translation Task" by Pau Baquero-Arnal et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the systems developed, but I need to look for specific datasets in the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention their participation in the WMT 2019 Similar Language Translation Shared Task, which suggests that they used specific datasets for training and evaluation. However, I need to find the exact names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Baseline systems)**, where the authors describe the training corpora used for their machine translation systems. They list the following datasets:

1. **JCR Corpus**: This dataset contains a total of 264,000 sentences in Portuguese and 264,000 sentences in Spanish, with a vocabulary size of 4131 for both languages.

2. **Europarl Corpus**: This dataset includes 156,000 sentences in Portuguese and 177,000 sentences in Spanish, with a vocabulary size of 621 for both languages.

3. **News Commentary Corpus**: This dataset has 47,000 sentences in Portuguese and 49,000 sentences in Spanish, with a vocabulary size of 48 for both languages.

4. **Wikititles Corpus**: This dataset consists of 295,000 sentences in Portuguese and 292,000 sentences in Spanish, with a vocabulary size of 10 for both languages.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide statistics for these datasets, confirming their use in training the translation systems. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used, as they are likely well-known corpora in the field of machine translation. Therefore, I will provide general citations for the datasets based on common knowledge:

- **JCR Corpus**: 
  > JCR Corpus. (n.d.). Retrieved from [source link if available].

- **Europarl Corpus**: 
  > Philipp Koehn et al. (2007). *Moses: Open source toolkit for statistical machine translation*. In Proceedings of the 45th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Prague, Czech Republic.

- **News Commentary Corpus**: 
  > News Commentary. (n.d.). Retrieved from [source link if available].

- **Wikititles Corpus**: 
  > Wikititles. (n.d.). Retrieved from [source link if available].

Since the paper does not provide specific references for the JCR and Wikititles corpora, I will note that these are commonly used datasets in the machine translation community.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
