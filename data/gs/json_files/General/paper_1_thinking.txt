To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PAWS-X: A Cross-lingual Adversarial Dataset for Paraphrase Identification" by Yinfei Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract**. Here, the authors introduce the PAWS-X dataset, stating that it consists of 23,659 human-translated evaluation pairs in six languages. This indicates that the dataset is central to the paper's contributions.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. The authors discuss the limitations of existing multilingual datasets for paraphrase identification and emphasize the creation of PAWS-X as a solution. They mention that PAWS-X is an extension of the original PAWS dataset, which is crucial for understanding its context.

In the **section 2 (PAWS-X Corpus)**, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset creation process. They explain that PAWS-X includes human translations of the original PAWS dataset into six languages: French, Spanish, German, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. This section confirms the dataset's structure and the languages involved.

I will also check the **experiments and results** sections to see if the authors mention any additional datasets or provide further context about PAWS-X. However, the focus remains on PAWS-X as the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the original PAWS dataset, which is essential since PAWS-X is derived from it. The citation for the PAWS dataset is:

- For **PAWS**:
  > Yuan Zhang, Jason Baldridge, and Luheng He. *PAWS: Paraphrase adversaries from word scrambling*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 1298â€“1308, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since PAWS-X is a new dataset created from the original PAWS dataset, I will also include the citation for PAWS-X itself:

- For **PAWS-X**:
  > Yinfei Yang, Yuan Zhang, Chris Tar, and Jason Baldridge. *PAWS-X: A Cross-lingual Adversarial Dataset for Paraphrase Identification*. Google Research, Mountain View, 94043.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both PAWS and PAWS-X. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
