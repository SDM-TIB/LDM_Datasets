To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning for Causal Sentence Detection" by Manolis Kyriakakis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of both generic public relation extraction datasets and a new biomedical causal sentence detection dataset, indicating that there are multiple datasets to identify.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of detecting causal relationships in biomedical texts and the need for datasets that contain causal instances. This reinforces the idea that datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **datasets section (Section 3)**, where the authors explicitly list and describe the datasets used in their experiments. They mention the following datasets:

1. **SemEval-2010 (Task 8)**: This dataset contains 10,674 samples, with 1,325 labeled as causal. It is used for multi-way classification of semantic relations between pairs of nominals.

2. **Causal-TimeBank (CausalTB)**: This dataset, identified by Mirza et al. (2014), contains 2,470 sentences, of which 244 are causal. The authors explain how they identified causal sentences using specific tags.

3. **Event StoryLine (EventSL)**: This dataset, as described by Caselli and Vossen (2017), contains 4,107 sentences, with 77 identified as causal based on certain attributes in the dataset.

4. **BioCausal**: The full biomedical causal detection dataset (BioCausal-Large) contains 13,342 sentences from PUBMED, with 7,562 labeled as causal. A publicly available subset (BioCausal-Small) contains 2,000 sentences, with 1,113 causal instances.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **SemEval-2010**, the citation is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing.
