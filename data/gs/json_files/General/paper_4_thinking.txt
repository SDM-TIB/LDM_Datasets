To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TMU Transformer System Using BERT for Re-ranking at BEA 2019" by Masahiro Kaneko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a system for grammatical error correction (GEC) and mentions the use of a development dataset, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. In this section, they list the following datasets in Table 1:

1. **FCE (First Certificate in English)**: This dataset contains 28,350 training sentences, 2,191 development sentences, and 2,695 test sentences. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Yannakoudakis, H., Briscoe, T., & Medlock, B. (2011). A New Dataset and Method for Automatically Grading ESOL Texts. In NAACL, pages 180–189, Portland, Oregon, USA. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **Lang-8**: This dataset has a total of 1,037,561 training sentences, with no development or test splits mentioned in the paper. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Mizumoto, T., Komachi, M., Nagata, M., & Matsumoto, Y. (2011). Mining Revision Log of Language Learning SNS for Automated Japanese Error Correction of Second Language Learners. In IJCNLP, pages 147–155, Chiang Mai, Thailand. Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing.

3. **NUCLE (National University of Singapore Corpus of Learner English)**: This dataset includes 57,151 training sentences, with no development or test splits mentioned. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Dahlmeier, D., Ng, H. T., & Wu, S. M. (2013). Building a Large Annotated Corpus of Learner English: The NUS Corpus of Learner English. In BEA, pages 22–31, Atlanta, Georgia. Association for Computational Linguistics.

4. **W&I+LOCNESS**: This dataset consists of 34,308 training sentences, 4,384 development sentences, and 4,477 test sentences. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Yannakoudakis, H., Andersen, Ø. E., Geranpayeh, A., Briscoe, T., & Nicholls, D. (2018). Developing an Automated Writing Placement System for ESL Learners. Applied Measurement in Education, 31(3), 251–267.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for each one, as they are crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format that is ready for further processing or review.
