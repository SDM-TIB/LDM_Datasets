To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-tuning BERT for Joint Entity and Relation Extraction in Chinese Medical Text" by Kui Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental studies sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **coronary angiography texts collected from Shuguang Hospital**, which suggests that this text corpus is a dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experimental studies section**. In this section, the authors describe the dataset used for entity and relation extraction, which is collected from coronary arteriography reports. They mention that the dataset includes five types of entities (Negation, Body Part, Degree, Quantiﬁer, and Location) and five relations (Negative, Modiﬁer, Position, Percentage, and No Relation). They also provide statistics about the dataset, indicating that it contains a total of 2,136 entities and 4,194 relations.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** for any papers or sources that describe the dataset in detail. However, in this case, the dataset appears to be a proprietary collection from Shuguang Hospital, and there may not be a formal citation available in the references.

Since the dataset is described as being collected from a specific hospital, I will note that it is a unique dataset and provide the following citation format:

- **Coronary Angiography Dataset**: Collected from coronary arteriography reports at Shuguang Hospital, Shanghai, China. This dataset includes various entity types and relations relevant to medical text processing.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as described above.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
