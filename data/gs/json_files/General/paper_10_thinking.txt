To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Patent Landscaping Model Using the Transformer and Graph Embedding" by Seokkyu Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors propose benchmark datasets for patent landscaping, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (KISTA datasets for patent landscaping)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets they constructed. They mention that they built datasets based on KISTA patent trend reports and provide a table listing the datasets along with their descriptions.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **MPUART (Marine Plant Using Augmented Reality Technology)**: This dataset includes patents related to augmented reality technology in marine applications.

2. **1MWDFS (Technology for 1MW Dual Frequency System)**: This dataset focuses on patents related to dual-frequency systems.

3. **MRRG (Technology for Micro Radar Rain Gauge)**: This dataset contains patents associated with micro radar technology for measuring rainfall.

4. **GOCS (Technology for Geostationary Orbit Complex Satellite)**: This dataset pertains to patents related to geostationary satellites.

In the **dataset description section**, the authors provide additional details, including the number of patents and valid patents for each dataset. They also mention the URLs where these datasets can be accessed.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The authors reference the KISTA patent trend reports as the source for their datasets, but they do not provide specific citations for each dataset since they are derived from the same source.

The citation for the KISTA reports is:
> Korean Intellectual Property Strategy Agency (KISTA). *KISTA Patent Trend Reports*. Available at: http://biz.kista.re.kr/patentmap/

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the KISTA reports as the source for all datasets.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
