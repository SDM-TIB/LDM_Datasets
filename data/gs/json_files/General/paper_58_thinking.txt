To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Long Warm-up and Self-Training: Training Strategies of NICT-2 NMT System at WAT-2019" by Kenji Imamura and Eiichiro Sumita, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and system summary sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in three tasks: **ASPEC.en-ja, ASPEC.ja-en, and TDDC.ja-en**. This suggests that datasets related to these tasks are likely discussed in detail.

Next, I will focus on the **System Summary section** where the authors describe the datasets used for the ASPEC tasks. They mention that the corpus for the ASPEC tasks is the **Asian Scientific Paper Excerpt Corpus**, and for the TDDC task, they used the **Timely Disclosure Documents Corpus**. I will note down these datasets and their characteristics.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide detailed information about the corpus sizes, which includes the number of sentences for each dataset. The ASPEC dataset has a total of **3,007,754 sentences** for training, with additional development and test sets. The TDDC dataset has **1,398,184 sentences** for training, along with its own development and test sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

1. For the **Asian Scientific Paper Excerpt Corpus (ASPEC)**, the citation is:
   > Toshiaki Nakazawa, Manabu Yaguchi, Kiyotaka Uchimoto, Masao Utiyama, Eiichiro Sumita, Sadao Kurohashi, and Hitoshi Isahara. *ASPEC: Asian scientific paper excerpt corpus*. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016), pages 2204–2208, Portorož, Slovenia.

2. For the **Timely Disclosure Documents Corpus (TDDC)**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the text, so I will need to ensure that I find the correct reference if it exists in the references section or if it is a well-known dataset.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **ASPEC Dataset**: A large dataset used for English-to-Japanese and Japanese-to-English translation tasks, consisting of scientific paper excerpts.
- **TDDC Dataset**: A dataset used for Japanese-to-English translation tasks, consisting of timely disclosure documents.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and attributed. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
