To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TENER: Adapting Transformer Encoder for Named Entity Recognition" by Hang Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **six NER datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets and their characteristics. I will look for a table or a descriptive paragraph that summarizes the datasets, which is likely to include information such as the dataset names, types, and sizes.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CoNLL2003**: This dataset is widely used for named entity recognition tasks and contains four types of named entities: PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, and MISC. 

2. **OntoNotes 5.0**: This dataset includes a diverse corpus from various domains, such as telephone conversations and news articles, and has multiple entity types.

3. **OntoNotes 4.0**: The authors specify that they are using the Chinese part of this dataset, which is also relevant for NER tasks.

4. **MSRA**: This dataset is derived from the news domain and is specifically designed for Chinese named entity recognition.

5. **Weibo**: This dataset is based on text from the Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo and includes various entity types.

6. **Resume**: This dataset was annotated for named entity recognition and is mentioned as part of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear and organized presentation of the datasets used in the research.
