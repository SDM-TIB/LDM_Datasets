To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Eﬃcient Attention Mechanism for Visual Dialog" by Van-Quang Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the **VisDial datasets**, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the development of visual dialog and reference the **VisDial dataset** as a key dataset for their experiments. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their work.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. They specifically mention the **VisDial v1.0 dataset**, which consists of a train split (123,287 images), a validation split (2,064 images), and a test split (8,000 images). Each image is associated with a dialog composed of 10 question-answer pairs along with a caption.

Additionally, they mention the **Audio Visual Scene-aware Dialog Dataset (AVSD)**, which is used to test the generality of their proposed method. This dataset includes audio and video features, indicating that it is also relevant to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **VisDial dataset**, the citation is:
   > Das, A., Kottur, S., Gupta, K., Singh, A., Yadav, D., Moura, J.M., Parikh, D., & Batra, D. (2017). Visual dialog. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 326–335.

2. For the **Audio Visual Scene-aware Dialog Dataset**, the citation is:
   > Hori, C., Alamri, H., Wang, J., Wichern, G., Hori, T., Cherian, A., Marks, T.K., Cartillier, V., Lopes, R.G., Das, A., et al. (2019). End-to-end audio visual scene-aware dialog using multimodal attention-based video features. In ICASSP 2019-2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 2352–2356.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
