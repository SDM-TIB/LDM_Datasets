To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Insertion-Deletion Transformer" by Laura Ruis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their model on **synthetic translation tasks**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors describe their experiments in detail. They mention two specific tasks for which they generated synthetic datasets:

1. **Shifting Alphabetic Sequences**: The authors explain that they generated 1000 examples for training and evaluated on 100 held-out examples. This indicates that a dataset was created specifically for this task.

2. **Caesar’s Cipher**: Similarly, they generated 100,000 examples for training and evaluated on 1000 held-out examples. This also points to the creation of a dataset tailored for this task.

Since these datasets are synthetic and generated by the authors, I will need to document them accordingly. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the datasets. However, since these datasets are synthetic and created for the purpose of this research, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that these datasets are generated by the authors for their experiments.

For the **Shifting Alphabetic Sequences**, I will summarize it as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Shifting Alphabetic Sequences
- **Description**: A synthetic dataset generated by sampling sequences of letters, where each letter is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. Contains 1000 training examples and 100 held-out examples.

For the **Caesar’s Cipher**, I will summarize it similarly:
- **Dataset Name**: Caesar’s Cipher
- **Description**: A synthetic dataset generated by applying the Caesar cipher to sequences of letters. Contains 100,000 training examples and 1000 held-out examples.

Since these datasets do not have formal citations, I will note that they are created by the authors of the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information about these datasets into a structured format that captures their names and descriptions, ready for further processing or review.
