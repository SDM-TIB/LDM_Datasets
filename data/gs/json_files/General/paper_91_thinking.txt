To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "HateMonitors: Language Agnostic Abuse Detection in Social Media" by Punyajoy Saha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a machine learning model for Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification in Indo-European Languages (HASOC), which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset and Task description)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used in their experiments. They mention that the datasets were provided for three languages: Hindi, English, and German, and that they participated in various subtasks related to these datasets.

In **subsection 3.1 (Datasets)**, the authors present statistics for the HASOC dataset, which includes training and test data for each language and subtask. They describe the dataset's balance and the number of instances for each subtask, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

The paper does not provide specific names for the datasets beyond referring to them as the HASOC dataset, but it does mention that the dataset was part of a shared task at FIRE 2019. Therefore, I will need to look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the HASOC dataset.

The relevant citation for the HASOC dataset is:
> Mandl, T., Modha, S., Patel, D., Dave, M., Mandlia, C., Patel, A. (2019). Overview of the HASOC track at FIRE 2019: Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification in Indo-European Languages. In Proceedings of the 11th annual meeting of the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (December 2019).

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the HASOC dataset in my final output.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured the essence of the datasets mentioned in the paper.
