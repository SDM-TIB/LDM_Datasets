To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PoWER-BERT: Accelerating BERT Inference via Progressive Word-vector Elimination" by Saurabh Goyal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on the **GLUE benchmark**, which indicates that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In **Table 1**, the authors list several datasets along with their respective tasks, number of classes, and input sequence lengths. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **CoLA** (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability): A dataset for acceptability judgment with 2 classes and an input sequence length of 64.
2. **RTE** (Recognizing Textual Entailment): A dataset for natural language inference with 2 classes and an input sequence length of 256.
3. **QQP** (Quora Question Pairs): A dataset for paraphrase detection with 2 classes and an input sequence length of 128.
4. **MRPC** (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus): A dataset for paraphrase detection with 2 classes and an input sequence length of 128.
5. **SST-2** (Stanford Sentiment Treebank): A dataset for sentiment analysis with 2 classes and an input sequence length of 64.
6. **MNLI-M** (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference): A dataset for natural language inference with 3 classes and an input sequence length of 128.
7. **MNLI-MM** (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference - Matched): Another version of MNLI with 3 classes and an input sequence length of 128.
8. **QNLI** (Question Natural Language Inference): A dataset for question answering and natural language inference with 2 classes and an input sequence length of 128.
9. **STS-B** (Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark): A regression dataset for measuring semantic similarity with no classes and an input sequence length of 64.
10. **IMDB**: A dataset for sentiment analysis with 2 classes and an input sequence length of 512.
11. **RACE** (Reading Comprehension Dataset from Examinations): A dataset for reading comprehension with 2 classes and an input sequence length of 512.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements.
