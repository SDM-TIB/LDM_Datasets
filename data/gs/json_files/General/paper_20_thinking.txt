To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Question Generation from Paragraphs: A Tale of Two Hierarchical Models" by Vishwajeet Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted empirical evaluation on the **SQuAD** and **MS MARCO** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **SQuAD Dataset**: This dataset contains 536 Wikipedia articles and over 100,000 questions posed about these articles by crowd-workers. The authors describe how they split the SQuAD train set into a training and development set for evaluation purposes.

2. **MS MARCO Dataset**: This dataset consists of passages retrieved from web documents, with questions that are anonymized versions of BING queries. The authors specify that they used a subset of the MS MARCO v1.1 dataset, which includes questions answerable from at least one paragraph.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **SQuAD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383â€“2392, 2016.

- For the **MS MARCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.09268, 2016.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
