To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bilingual is At Least Monolingual (BALM): A Novel Translation Algorithm that Encodes Monolingual Priors" by Jeffrey Cheng and Chris Callison-Burch, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on the **Multi30k dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for their research.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of machine translation and the need for bilingual corpora. They mention the **Multi30k dataset** specifically as a multilingual extension of the Flickr30k image-captioning dataset. This reinforces its significance in their work.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe how they utilize the **Multi30k dataset** for their experiments. They provide details about the dataset, including its structure, which consists of English and German captions for images. This section confirms that the dataset is indeed used for training and evaluation purposes.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Multi30k dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Desmond Elliott, Stella Frank, Khalil Simaâ€™an, and Lucia Specia. *Multi30k: Multilingual English-German Image Descriptions*. CoRR, abs/1605.00459, 2016.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **Multi30k dataset**, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will involve summarizing the dataset's purpose, structure, and the context in which it was used in the research.

After completing these steps, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset that can be used for further analysis or integration into a larger dataset repository.
