To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Machine Translation with Dependency-Aware Self-Attention" by Emanuele Bugliarello and Naoaki Okazaki, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on several translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 3) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this section, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, including:

1. **News Commentary v11 (NC11)**: This dataset is used for English-German (En-De) and German-English (De-En) translation tasks.
2. **WMT16**: This dataset is used for English-German translation tasks.
3. **WMT17**: This dataset is also used for English-German translation tasks.
4. **WMT18**: This dataset is used for English-Turkish (En-Tr) translation tasks.
5. **WAT**: This dataset is used for English-Japanese (En-Ja) translation tasks.

I will note the details provided about each dataset, including the specific tasks they are used for and any relevant statistics mentioned in the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

- For **News Commentary v11 (NC11)**, the citation is:

- For **WMT16**, the citation is:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
