To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Segatron: Segment-Aware Transformer for Language Modeling and Understanding" by He Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved a perplexity of 17.1 on the **WikiText-103 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is used in their experiments. This is a good starting point for identifying datasets.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to find any additional datasets mentioned. In the experiments, the authors describe their methodology and results, which often includes the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any specific mentions of datasets, especially in the context of language modeling tasks.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **WikiText-103**: This dataset is described as a large word-level dataset with long-distance dependencies for language modeling, containing 103 million tokens and 28,000 articles for training.

2. **English Wikipedia**: This dataset is used for pre-training the SegaBERT model, as mentioned in the data preparation section.

3. **BookCorpus**: This dataset is also mentioned as part of the pre-training corpus for the SegaBERT model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **WikiText-103**, the citation is:
  > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2017). *Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models*. In ICLR 2017, Toulon, France, April 24-26, 2017.

- For **BookCorpus**, the citation is:
  > Zhu, Y., Kiros, R., Zemel, R. S., Salakhutdinov, R., Urtasun, R., Torralba, A., & Fidler, S. (2015). *Aligning Books and Movies: Towards Story-Like Visual Explanations by Watching Movies and Reading Books*. In ICCV 2015, Santiago, Chile, December 7-13, 2015.

- The **English Wikipedia** dataset does not have a specific citation in the references, as it is a commonly used dataset in NLP research.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
