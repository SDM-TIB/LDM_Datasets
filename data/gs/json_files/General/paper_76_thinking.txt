To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scheduled Sampling for Transformers" by Tsvetomila Mihaylova and André F. T. Martins, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses experiments on two language pairs, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors detail their methodology. Here, they mention using datasets for machine translation tasks on two language pairs: **IWSLT 2017 German-English (DE-EN)** and **KFTT Japanese-English (JA-EN)**. This indicates that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **IWSLT 2017 German-English (DE-EN)** dataset, the citation is:
   > Mauro Cettolo, Marcello Federico, Luisa Bentivogli, Niehues Jan, Stüker Sebastian, Sudoh Katsuitho, Yoshino Koichiro, and Federmann Christian. *Overview of the IWSLT 2017 Evaluation Campaign*. In International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, pages 2–14, 2017.

2. For the **KFTT Japanese-English (JA-EN)** dataset, the citation is:
   > Graham Neubig. *The Kyoto Free Translation Task*. 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
