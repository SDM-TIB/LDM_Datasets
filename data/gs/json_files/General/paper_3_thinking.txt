To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MULTIQA: An Empirical Investigation of Generalization and Transfer in Reading Comprehension" by Alon Talmor and Jonathan Berant, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted an investigation over ten reading comprehension datasets, which suggests that multiple datasets will be detailed in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section** (section 2), where the authors describe the datasets used for their investigation. They categorize the datasets into large and small datasets and provide specific details about each one. I will extract the names, sizes, contexts, and other relevant characteristics of each dataset mentioned.

The paper lists the following datasets:

1. **SQUAD**: A large dataset with crowdsourced questions based on Wikipedia paragraphs.
   - Citation: Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. In *Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)*.

2. **NEWSQA**: A dataset with questions authored by crowdsourcing workers based on CNN articles.
   - Citation: Trischler, A., Wang, T., Yuan, X., Harris, J., Sordoni, A., Bachman, P., & Suleman, K. (2017). NewsQA: A machine comprehension dataset. In *Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP*.

3. **SEARCHQA**: Trivia questions from Jeopardy! with web snippets as context.
   - Citation: Dunn, M., Sagun, L., Higgins, M., Guney, U., Cirik, V., & Cho, K. (2017). SearchQA: A new Q&A dataset augmented with context from a search engine. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.05179.

4. **TRIVIAQA**: A dataset with trivia questions crawled from the web.
   - Citation: Joshi, M., Choi, E., Weld, D., & Zettlemoyer, L. (2017). TriviaQA: A large scale distantly supervised challenge dataset for reading comprehension. In *Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)*.

5. **HOTPOTQA**: A dataset requiring multi-hop reasoning over related Wikipedia paragraphs.
   - Citation: Yang, Z., Qi, P., Zhang, S., Bengio, Y., Cohen, W. W., & Manning, C. D. (2018). HotpotQA: A dataset for diverse, explainable multi-hop question answering. In *Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)*.

For the small datasets, I will extract the following:

1. **CQ**: Questions from Google web queries.
   - Citation: Bao, J., Duan, N., Yan, Z., Zhou, M., & Zhao, T. (2016). Constraint-based question answering with knowledge graph. In *International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING)*.

2. **CWQ**: Compositional formal queries against Freebase.
   - Citation: Talmor, A., & Berant, J. (2018). The web as knowledge-base for answering complex questions. In *North American Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL)*.

3. **WIKIHOP**: Questions based on entity-relation pairs from Freebase.
   - Citation: Welbl, J., Stenetorp, P., & Riedel, S. (2017). Constructing datasets for multi-hop reading comprehension across documents. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.06481.

4. **COMQA**: Questions from the WikiAnswers community QA platform.
   - Citation: Abujabal, A., Roy, R. S., Yahya, M., & Weikum, G. (2018). ComQA: A community-sourced dataset for complex factoid question answering with paraphrase clusters. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.09528.

5. **DROP**: A dataset focusing on quantitative reasoning.
   - Citation: Dua, D., Wang, Y., Dasigi, P., Stanovsky, G., Singh, S., & Gardner, M. (2019). DROP: A reading comprehension benchmark requiring discrete reasoning over paragraphs. In *North American Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL)*.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, as they are crucial for proper referencing. Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further use or analysis.
