To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Positional Embedding for Neural Machine Translation" by Kehai Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their methods on the **WMT’14 English-to-German** and **NIST Chinese-to-English** translation tasks, suggesting that these datasets are significant for their experiments.

Next, I will look closely at **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. They mention that the **WMT’14 training set** includes 4.43 million bilingual sentence pairs from the WMT’14 corpora, and the **NIST Chinese-to-English training set** consists of 1.28 million bilingual sentence pairs from the LDC corpora. This confirms that both datasets are crucial for their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **WMT’14 English-to-German dataset**, the citation is:
   > Bojar, O., et al. (2014). *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1–30.

2. For the **NIST Chinese-to-English dataset**, the citation is:
   > NIST. (2006). *NIST Open Machine Translation Evaluation*. In Proceedings of the NIST Machine Translation Evaluation.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **WMT’14 English-to-German dataset**: A large dataset containing 4.43 million bilingual sentence pairs used for training in the WMT’14 translation task.
- **NIST Chinese-to-English dataset**: A dataset comprising 1.28 million bilingual sentence pairs from the LDC corpora, utilized for the NIST translation task.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
