To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Token-Level Ensemble Distillation for Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion" by Hao Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to experiments conducted on the **CMUDict dataset** and an **internal English dataset**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **CMUDict 0.7b**: This is a publicly available dataset used for G2P conversion, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing. The authors note that it contains 108,952 training words, 5,447 validation words, and 12,855 test words.

2. **Internal English Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 184,243 training words, 10,837 validation words, and 21,678 test words. The authors also mention that it includes uppercase and lowercase letters and stress markings.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for the **CMUDict dataset** is typically attributed to:

- **CMU Pronouncing Dictionary**: 
  > We can cite it as: "Carnegie Mellon University. CMU Pronouncing Dictionary. [Online]. Available: http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict"

For the **internal dataset**, since it is not publicly available and does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is an internal dataset used by the authors.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **CMUDict 0.7b**: A publicly available dataset for G2P conversion with specific splits for training, validation, and testing.
2. **Internal English Dataset**: An internal dataset used by the authors, containing a significant number of training, validation, and test words.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for further processing or review.
