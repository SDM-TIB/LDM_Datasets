To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BERT for Evidence Retrieval and Claim Verification" by Amir Soleimani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the **FEVER dataset**, which is a clear indication that it is a primary dataset used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the need for datasets in the context of evidence-based claim verification. They specifically mention the **Fact Extraction and VERiﬁcation (FEVER)** shared task, which introduces a benchmark for evidence-based claim verification. This section confirms that the FEVER dataset is central to their work.

In the **methods section**, the authors elaborate on how they utilize the FEVER dataset, describing it as consisting of 185K generated claims labeled as 'SUPPORTED', 'REFUTED', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'. This detailed description reinforces the importance of the FEVER dataset in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the FEVER dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **FEVER Dataset**: 
  > Thorne, J., Vlachos, A., Christodoulopoulos, C., & Mittal, A. (2018). *FEVER: a large-scale dataset for fact extraction and verification*. CoRR, abs/1803.05355.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the **MS MARCO** dataset in the context of related work, but they do not use it directly in their experiments. Therefore, I will not include it as a dataset used in their research.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the FEVER dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

In summary, the only dataset extracted from this paper is the FEVER dataset, and I will document it accordingly.
