To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Contextual Representation Learning Without Softmax Layer" by Liunian Harold Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their contents or characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **One Billion Word Benchmark** for training their models. I will note this dataset as it is a significant benchmark in the field of language modeling.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the One Billion Word Benchmark. The citation is as follows:
- Ciprian Chelba, Tomas Mikolov, Mike Schuster, Qi Ge, Thorsten Brants, Phillipp Koehn, and Tony Robinson. *One billion word benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.3005, 2013.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings in a clear format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset extracted from the paper.
