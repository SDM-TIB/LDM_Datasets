To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Word-level Textual Adversarial Attacking as Combinatorial Optimization" by Yuan Zang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the following datasets:

1. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and consists of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. The authors note that it contains 25,000 training samples and 25,000 test samples.

2. **SST-2 Dataset**: This is another sentiment analysis dataset, which is shorter in average sentence length compared to IMDB. It has 6,920 training samples and 1,821 test samples.

3. **SNLI Dataset**: This dataset is used for natural language inference (NLI) tasks. It consists of premise-hypothesis pairs labeled with one of three relations: entailment, contradiction, or neutral. The dataset has 550,152 instances.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L Maas, Raymond E Daly, Peter T Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of ACL-HLT, 2011.

- For the **SST-2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of EMNLP, 2013.

- For the **SNLI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Samuel Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of EMNLP, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
