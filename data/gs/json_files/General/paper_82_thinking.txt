To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DIET: Lightweight Language Understanding for Dialogue Systems" by Tanja Bunk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a complex multi-domain NLU dataset, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **NLU-Benchmark**: This dataset is highlighted as the primary focus of their experiments. It contains 25,716 utterances annotated with scenarios, actions, and entities, covering various home assistant tasks. The data is split into 10 folds, with specific train and test sets for each fold.

2. **ATIS**: The ATIS dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of NLU, comprising annotated transcripts of audio recordings for flight reservations. The authors mention using a specific data split originally proposed by Goo et al. (2018).

3. **SNIPS**: This dataset is collected from the Snips personal voice assistant and contains training and test examples. The authors also refer to the data split used in previous works for consistency.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **NLU-Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Liu, X., Han, Z., & VuliÄ‡, I. (2019). Benchmarking natural language understanding services for building conversational agents. *CoRR*, abs/1903.05566.

- For **ATIS**, the citation is:
  > Hemphill, C., Godfrey, J. J., & Doddington, G. R. (1990). The ATIS spoken language systems pilot corpus. In *Speech and Natural Language: Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Hidden Valley, Pennsylvania, June 24-27, 1990*.

- For **SNIPS**, the citation is:
  > Coucke, A., Saade, A., Ball, A., Bluche, T., Caulier, A., Leroy, D., ... & Dureau, J. (2018). Snips voice platform: an embedded spoken language understanding system for private-by-design voice interfaces. *CoRR*, abs/1805.10190.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
