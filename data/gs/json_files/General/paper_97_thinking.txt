To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Domain Adaptation with BERT-based Domain Classification and Data Selection" by Xiaofei Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their framework on four large public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets across three task categories:

1. **SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference)**: The authors describe this dataset as a collection of 570,000 human-written English sentence pairs for the task of natural language inference.

2. **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is noted to contain 433,000 sentence pairs annotated with textual entailment information, covering various genres.

3. **QNLI (Question-answering Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is derived from the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and is used for a different task type, focusing on question-paragraph pairs.

4. **QQP (Quora Question Pairs)**: This dataset consists of question pairs from Quora, where the task is to determine if the questions are semantically equivalent.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **SNLI**:
  > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 632–640, 2015.

- For **MNLI**:
  > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel R. Bowman. *A Broad-Coverage Challenge Corpus for Sentence Understanding through Inference*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1112–1122, 2017.

- For **QNLI**:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 2383–2392, 2016.

- For **QQP**:
  > Zhiguo Wang, Wael Hamza, and Radu Florian. *Bilateral multi-perspective matching for natural language sentences*. In Proceedings of the 2017 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), pages 4144–4150, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration or replication of the study.
