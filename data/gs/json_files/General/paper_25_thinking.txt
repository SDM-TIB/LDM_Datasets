To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "DLGNet: A Transformer-based Model for Dialogue Response Generation" by Oluwatobi O. Olabiyi and Erik T. Mueller, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they evaluate their model on the **Movie Triples dataset** and the **Ubuntu Dialogue dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors provide more details about the datasets. They mention that the **Movie dataset** contains about 240,000 dialogue triples and is suitable for studying relevance-diversity tradeoffs in multi-turn conversations. The **Ubuntu Dialogue dataset**, on the other hand, is extracted from the Ubuntu Relay Chat Channel and contains approximately 1.85 million conversations, making it ideal for domain-specific dialogue modeling.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Movie Triples dataset**, the citation is:
  > Serban, I.; Sordoni, A.; Bengio, Y.; Courville, A.; and Pineau, J. 2016. *Building end-to-end dialogue systems using generative hierarchical neural network models*. In Proceedings of The Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2016), 3776â€“3784.

- For the **Ubuntu Dialogue dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lowe, R.; Pow, N.; Serban, I.; and Pineau, J. 2015. *The ubuntu dialogue corpus: A large dataset for research in unstructured multi-turn dialogue systems*. In SIGDIAL.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
