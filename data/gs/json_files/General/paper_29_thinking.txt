To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Context Enhanced Multi-Domain Dialogue System for Multi-domain Task Completion" by Jingyuan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related works sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the system is evaluated on the **MultiWOZ dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this case, the **experiments section** is crucial, as it typically contains information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors explicitly state that they apply the **MultiWOZ dataset** to develop their system.

In the **experiments section**, they provide a brief description of the **MultiWOZ dataset**, noting that it consists of 10,438 dialogues related to tourism across seven domains. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's scope and relevance.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **MultiWOZ dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Budzianowski, P.; Wen, T.-H.; Tseng, B.-H.; Casanueva, I.; Ultes, S.; Ramadan, O.; and Gaˇsi´c, M. (2018). *MultiWOZ - A large-scale multi-domain wizard-of-oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.00278.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **MultiWOZ dataset**, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that the dataset name, description, and citation are clearly presented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **MultiWOZ dataset** based on the information gathered, ensuring that it is ready for any downstream processing or review.
