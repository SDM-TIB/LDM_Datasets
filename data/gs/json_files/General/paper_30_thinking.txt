To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Asking without Telling: Exploring Latent Ontologies in Contextual Representations" by Julian Michael et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their approach and the tasks they evaluate, which may involve specific datasets. I will pay attention to any explicit names of datasets or references to existing datasets used for training or evaluation.

In the **experimental setup** section, the authors detail the tasks and encoders they used. They mention using the **English Web Treebank part of Universal Dependencies 2.2** and the **English portion of Ontonotes 5.0** for various tasks. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. **English Web Treebank part of Universal Dependencies 2.2**:
   > Silveira, N., Dozat, T., de Marneffe, M.-C., Bowman, S., Connor, M., Bauer, J., & Manning, C. D. (2014). A gold standard dependency corpus for English. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’14), pages 2897–2904. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

2. **English portion of Ontonotes 5.0**:
   > Weischedel, R., Palmer, M., Marcus, M., Hovy, E., Pradhan, S., Ramshaw, L., & Xue, N. (2013). OntoNotes 5.0: The 5.0 release of the OntoNotes corpus. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, PA.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper while providing accurate citations for future reference.
