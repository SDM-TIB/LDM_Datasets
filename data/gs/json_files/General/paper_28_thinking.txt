To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Analysis of Natural Language Inference Systems" by Tiffany Chien and Jugal Kalita, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of standard NLI datasets like **SNLI** and **MNLI**, which indicates that these datasets are significant to the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. The **Related Work** section may provide insights into other datasets used in the context of adversarial analysis. I will pay close attention to any references to datasets that are used for evaluation or comparison.

In the **Results and Analysis** section, the authors discuss various adversarial datasets, including:

1. **Glockner et al. (2018)**: This dataset modifies SNLI examples to test lexical inferences. It is crucial to note that this dataset is referenced as a challenge to existing models.
   
2. **Naik et al. (2018)**: This dataset is composed of various tests motivated by mistakes made by previous models, focusing on antonyms, word overlap, negation, and spelling errors.

3. **McCoy et al. (2019)**: This dataset is particularly important as it is used to analyze the reliance of models on syntactic heuristics. It consists of examples generated from templates that break these heuristics.

I will then check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for understanding the context and implications of the findings.
