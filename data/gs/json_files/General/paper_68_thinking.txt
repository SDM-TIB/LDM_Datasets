To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enriching the Transformer with Linguistic Factors for Low-Resource Machine Translation" by Jordi Armengol-Estapé et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental framework sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on low-resource datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental framework section** (section 4), where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **IWSLT14**: This dataset is used for the German-to-English translation task and contains approximately 160,000 sentences. The authors reference the original work that introduced this dataset.

2. **FLoRes**: This dataset is utilized for the English-to-Nepali translation task and consists of 564,000 parallel sentences. The authors note that this dataset is considered extremely low-resource and challenging due to the significant linguistic differences between the languages.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations I find are:

- For **IWSLT14**, the citation is:
  > Mauro Cettolo, Jan Niehues, Sebastian Stüker, Luisa Bentivogli, and Marcello Federico. *Report on the 11th IWSLT Evaluation Campaign, IWSLT 2014*. In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, Hanoi, Vietnam, page 57, 2014.

- For **FLoRes**, the citation is:
  > Francisco Guzmán, Peng-Jen Chen, Myle Ott, Juan Pino, Guillaume Lample, Philipp Koehn, Vishrav Chaudhary, and Marc’Aurelio Ranzato. *Two New Evaluation Datasets for Low-Resource Machine Translation: Nepali-English and Sinhala-English*. CoRR, abs/1902.01382, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
