To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KU ai at MEDIQA 2019: Domain-specific Pre-training and Transfer Learning for Medical NLI" by Cemil Cengiz, Deniz Yuret, and Ulaş Sert, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **MedNLI dataset** and also mentions the use of **MultiNLI** and **SNLI** datasets for improving model performance. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **MedNLI**: This dataset is specifically designed for the task of Natural Language Inference in the medical domain, created from clinical notes. The authors mention that it contains 11,232 training examples.

2. **MultiNLI**: A general domain dataset that contains 392,702 training examples, spanning various genres of written and spoken English.

3. **SNLI**: Another general domain dataset with 550,152 training examples, created from image captions.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilized these datasets for training and evaluation, which reinforces their importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MedNLI**, the citation is:
  > Alexey Romanov and Chaitanya Shivade. *Lessons from natural language inference in the clinical domain*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1586–1596, Brussels, Belgium, 2018. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **MultiNLI**, the citation is:
  > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1112–1122, New Orleans, Louisiana, 2018. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **SNLI**, the citation is:
  > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 632–640, Lisbon, Portugal, 2015. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
