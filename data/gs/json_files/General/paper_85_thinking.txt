To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention is Not Only a Weight: Analyzing Transformers with Vector Norms" by Goro Kobayashi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the analysis of attention mechanisms in Transformers, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain information about the datasets used for the experiments. In this section, the authors mention using data provided by Clark et al. (2019) for their analysis of BERT. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find the specific name and details.

Upon further reading, I find that the authors used a dataset consisting of **992 sequences extracted from Wikipedia**, where each sequence consists of two consecutive paragraphs. This dataset is crucial for their analysis, and I will need to document it.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset used in their experiments. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the dataset used from Clark et al. (2019):
  > Kevin Clark, Urvashi Khandelwal, Omer Levy, and Christopher D Manning. *What Does BERT Look At? An Analysis of BERT’s Attention*. In Proceedings of the 2019 ACL Workshop BlackboxNLP: Analyzing and Interpreting Neural Networks for NLP, pages 276–286.

Additionally, in **section 5 (Experiments: Transformer for NMT)**, the authors mention using the **Europarl v7 corpus** for training a Transformer-based NMT system. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

I will also look for the citation for the Europarl v7 corpus in the references. The citation is:

- For the Europarl v7 corpus:
  > Philipp Koehn. *Europarl: A Parallel Corpus for Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Tenth Machine Translation Summit, pages 79–86, 2005.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
