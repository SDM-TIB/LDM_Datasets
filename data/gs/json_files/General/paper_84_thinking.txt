To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Local Neighboring Structure for Robust 3D Shape Representation" by Zhongpai Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the importance of representation learning for 3D meshes and reference several existing methods and datasets. However, I need to look for specific datasets that are utilized in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section**, where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **COMA Dataset**: This dataset consists of 12 classes of extreme facial expressions from 12 different subjects, containing 20,466 3D meshes registered to a common reference template with 5023 vertices.

2. **DFAUST Dataset**: This dataset includes over 40,000 real meshes capturing 129 dynamic performances from 10 subjects, with a mesh registration method that uses both 3D geometry and texture information to register all scans to a common reference topology with 6890 vertices.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **COMA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ranjan, A., Bolkart, T., Sanyal, S., & Black, M. J. (2018). Generating 3D Faces using Convolutional Mesh Autoencoders. In The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

- For the **DFAUST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bogo, F., Romero, J., Loper, M., & Black, M. J. (2017). Dynamic FAUST: Registering Human Bodies in Motion. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
