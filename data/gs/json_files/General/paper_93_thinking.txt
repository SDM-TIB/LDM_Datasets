To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-Shot Learning via Embedding Adaptation with Set-to-Set Functions" by Han-Jia Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss few-shot learning and mention the need for datasets that facilitate this type of learning. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point, so I will continue to the experiments section.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention:

1. **MiniImageNet**: A subset of ImageNet containing 100 classes with 600 examples per class, used for few-shot classification tasks.
2. **TieredImageNet**: A larger dataset with 351 training classes, 97 validation classes, and 160 test classes, also derived from ImageNet.
3. **CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011)**: A dataset specifically designed for fine-grained classification, containing 11,788 images across 200 bird species.
4. **OfficeHome**: A dataset containing images from four domains, used to validate the generalization ability of the proposed method.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MiniImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., Kavukcuoglu, K., & Wierstra, D. (2016). Matching networks for one shot learning. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* (pp. 3630-3638).

- For **TieredImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Ren, M., Triantafillou, E., Ravi, S., Snell, J., Swersky, K., Tenenbaum, J. B., Larochelle, H., & Zemel, R. S. (2018). Meta-learning for semi-supervised few-shot classification. In *International Conference on Learning Representations*.

- For **CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011)**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology.

- For **OfficeHome**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
