To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HLT@SUDA at SemEval 2019 Task 1: UCCA Graph Parsing as Constituent Tree Parsing" by Wei Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a UCCA semantic graph parsing approach, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context about UCCA but does not explicitly mention datasets either.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors mention using the **English-Wiki dataset** and **German-20K dataset** for their evaluations. They provide some statistics about the datasets, such as the distribution of discontinuous structures, which indicates that these datasets are indeed relevant for their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The references may include papers or resources where these datasets were introduced or described in detail.

1. For the **English-Wiki dataset**, the citation is:
   > Daniel Hershcovich, Zohar Aizenbud, Leshem Choshen, Elior Sulem, Ari Rappoport, and Omri Abend. 2019. *Semeval 2019 task 1: Cross-lingual semantic parsing with ucca*. arXiv:1903.02953.

2. For the **German-20K dataset**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper, but it is likely related to the same task and can be referenced from the same source as the English-Wiki dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
