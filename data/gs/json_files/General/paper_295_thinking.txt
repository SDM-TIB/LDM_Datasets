To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cognate-aware morphological segmentation for multilingual neural translation" by Stig-Arne Gr√∂nroos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions participation in the WMT18 News Translation Shared Task, which suggests that there are datasets involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **Data section (Section 4)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. They mention that they have a total of **9 million multilingual sentence pairs**, with specific breakdowns for English-Finnish and English-Estonian datasets. This section is crucial as it provides the quantitative details about the datasets.

In the **Data subsection (4.1)**, the authors describe the preprocessing steps and the sources of the data. They mention that the English-Finnish dataset consists of **2.2 million parallel data** and **4.1 million synthetic backtranslated data**, while the English-Estonian dataset includes **1 million parallel data** and **1.8 million backtranslated data**. This information is essential for understanding the datasets' composition.

I will also look for any specific dataset names or references to publicly available datasets. The authors mention that they generated a Finnish-Estonian parallel dataset by triangulating from English-Finnish and English-Estonian datasets, which indicates that they created a new dataset from existing ones.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not explicitly cite any external datasets, as it primarily discusses the datasets they created or used in their experiments.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details such as the dataset names, descriptions, and any available citations. The focus will be on the datasets used for the multilingual translation task, particularly the English-Finnish and English-Estonian datasets.

Finally, I will format the dataset entries according to the required structure, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation, even if it is a self-created dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
