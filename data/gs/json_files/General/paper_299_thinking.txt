To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Integrating Multimodal Information in Large Pretrained Transformers" by Wasifur Rahman et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using the **CMU-MOSI** and **CMU-MOSEI** datasets for multimodal sentiment analysis, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 5) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In **section 5.1**, they describe the **CMU-MOSI Dataset** as follows:

- **CMU-MOSI Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,199 video segments from 93 YouTube movie review videos, with sentiment intensity annotations ranging from -3 to +3.

Then, I will check **section 5.2** for the **CMU-MOSEI Dataset**. The authors mention that this dataset is used for comparison and has sentiment annotations at the sentence level. However, they do not provide a detailed description in this section, so I will refer to the references for the full citation.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. For **CMU-MOSI Dataset**, the citation is:
   > Amir Zadeh, Rowan Zellers, Eli Pincus, and Louis-Philippe Morency. *MOSI: Multimodal Corpus of Sentiment Intensity and Subjectivity Analysis in Online Opinion Videos*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.06259, 2016.

2. For **CMU-MOSEI Dataset**, the citation is:
   > AmirAli Bagher Zadeh, Paul Pu Liang, Soujanya Poria, Erik Cambria, and Louis-Philippe Morency. *Multimodal Language Analysis in the Wild: CMU-MOSEI Dataset and Interpretable Dynamic Fusion Graph*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 2236â€“2246, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
