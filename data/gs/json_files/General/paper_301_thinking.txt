To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FQuAD: French Question Answering Dataset" by Martin d’Hoffschmidt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract introduces the FQuAD dataset, highlighting its purpose and the number of samples in its two versions (FQuAD1.0 and FQuAD1.1). This indicates that the dataset is significant and likely to be detailed further in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **datasets section** (section 3) where the authors describe the collection process for FQuAD. Here, they mention that FQuAD consists of two versions:
1. **FQuAD1.0**: Contains over 25,000 samples.
2. **FQuAD1.1**: Contains over 60,000 samples, with additional samples annotated to increase complexity.

In this section, the authors provide detailed statistics about the training, development, and test splits for both versions:
- For **FQuAD1.0**:
  - Training: 20,703 samples
  - Development: 3,188 samples
  - Test: 2,189 samples

- For **FQuAD1.1**:
  - Training: 50,741 samples
  - Development: 5,668 samples
  - Test: 5,594 samples

I will also look for any references to other datasets that may be mentioned in the context of FQuAD. The authors reference several existing datasets in the related work section, such as SQuAD1.1, SQuAD2.0, and others, but the primary focus remains on FQuAD.

Next, I will check the **references section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following datasets:
- **SQuAD1.1**:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383–2392, Austin, Texas, November 2016.

- **SQuAD2.0**:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Robin Jia, and Percy Liang. *Know what you don’t know: Unanswerable questions for SQuAD*. CoRR, abs/1806.03822, 2018.

- **FQuAD**:
  > Martin d’Hoffschmidt, Wacim Belblidia, Tom Brendlé, Quentin Heinrich. *FQuAD: French Question Answering Dataset*. Illuin Technology, Paris, France, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:
1. **FQuAD1.0**: A French reading comprehension dataset with over 25,000 samples.
   - Citation: Martin d’Hoffschmidt et al. (2020).
   
2. **FQuAD1.1**: An extended version of FQuAD1.0 with over 60,000 samples.
   - Citation: Martin d’Hoffschmidt et al. (2020).

3. **SQuAD1.1**: A widely used English dataset for question answering.
   - Citation: Rajpurkar et al. (2016).

4. **SQuAD2.0**: An extension of SQuAD1.1 that includes unanswerable questions.
   - Citation: Rajpurkar et al. (2018).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation.
