To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-Training with Whole Word Masking for Chinese BERT" by Yiming Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on **ten Chinese NLP tasks** and reference specific datasets associated with these tasks.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any subsections that discuss the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **CMRC 2018**: A span-extraction machine reading comprehension dataset similar to SQuAD.
2. **DRCD**: A span-extraction MRC dataset in Traditional Chinese.
3. **CJRC**: A dataset for Chinese judicial reading comprehension.
4. **ChnSentiCorp**: A sentiment classification dataset.
5. **THUCNews**: A news classification dataset containing articles from various genres.
6. **TNEWS**: A short text classification dataset consisting of news titles.
7. **XNLI**: A cross-lingual sentence classification dataset.
8. **LCQMC**: A large-scale Chinese question matching corpus.
9. **BQ Corpus**: A dataset for sentence semantic equivalence identification.
10. **OCNLI**: A dataset for Chinese natural language inference.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
