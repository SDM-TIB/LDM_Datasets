To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Character-based NMT with Transformer" by Rohit Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using datasets for both high-resource and low-resource settings, specifically for the DE-EN (German-English) and EN-DE (English-German) translation tasks.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find the following datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **IWSLT 2014**: This dataset consists of transcriptions and translations of TED Talks, specifically used in the low-resource setting. The authors mention it has 6,750 sentences with a percentage of unseen words.

2. **WMT 2016 newstest**: This dataset is used for the WMT 2016 news translation task, containing 2,999 sentences.

3. **WMT Biomedical**: This dataset includes Medline abstracts from the WMT 2018 biomedical translation task, with 321 sentences.

4. **WMT-IT**: This dataset consists of hardware and software troubleshooting answers from the WMT 2016 IT domain translation task, containing 2,000 sentences.

5. **Europarl**: This dataset includes the first 3,000 sentences from the Europarl corpus, which is a parallel corpus for statistical machine translation.

6. **Commoncrawl**: This dataset consists of the first 3,000 sentences from the commoncrawl parallel text corpus.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Here are the citations I will extract:

- For **IWSLT 2014**, the citation is:
  > Federico, M., Stüker, S., & Yvon, F. (2014). *International workshop on spoken language translation*. In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation. Lake Tahoe, CA, USA: Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **WMT 2016 newstest**, the citation is:
  > Smith, J. R., Saint-Amand, H., Plamada, M., Koehn, P., Callison-Burch, C., & Lopez, A. (2013). *Dirt cheap web-scale parallel text from the common crawl*. In Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Asian Translation (WAT2017). Taipei, Taiwan: Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing.

- For **WMT Biomedical**, the citation is:
  > Koehn, P. (2004). *Europarl: A parallel corpus for statistical machine translation*. In Proceedings of the 5th Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2006).

- For **WMT-IT**, the citation is:
  > Axelrod, A., He, X., & Gao, J. (2011). *Domain adaptation via pseudo in-domain data selection*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, ser. EMNLP ’11. Stroudsburg, PA, USA: Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **Europarl**, the citation is:
  > Koehn, P. (2004). *Europarl: A parallel corpus for statistical machine translation*. In Proceedings of the 5th Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2006).

- For **Commoncrawl**, the citation is:
  > Smith, J. R., Saint-Amand, H., Plamada, M., Koehn, P., Callison-Burch, C., & Lopez, A. (2013). *Dirt cheap web-scale parallel text from the common crawl*. In Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Asian Translation (WAT2017). Taipei, Taiwan: Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
