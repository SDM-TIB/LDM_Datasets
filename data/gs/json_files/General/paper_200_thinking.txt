To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Variational Transformers for Diverse Response Generation" by Zhaojiang Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed models are evaluated on three conversational datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **MojiTalk Dataset**: This dataset consists of 596,959 post and response pairs from Twitter, with each response labeled by one emoji indicating the response emotion. The authors note that they used preprocessed data and vocabulary released from a previous work.

2. **PersonaChat Dataset**: This dataset involves one-to-one multi-turn conversations revolving around personas established by four to six persona sentences. It is designed to model social skills and enhance user engagement.

3. **Empathetic-Dialogues Dataset**: Similar to PersonaChat, this dataset focuses on conversations about situations that happen to one of the speakers, aiming to understand feelings and provide appropriate responses.

In the same section, the authors mention that they combine the train/validation/test sets of the PersonaChat and Empathetic-Dialogues datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MojiTalk Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xianda Zhou and William Yang Wang. *Mojitalk: Generating emotional responses at scale*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1128–1137, 2018.

- For the **PersonaChat Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Saizheng Zhang, Emily Dinan, Jack Urbanek, Arthur Szlam, Douwe Kiela, and Jason Weston. *Personalizing dialogue agents: I have a dog, do you have pets too?* In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 2204–2213, 2018.

- For the **Empathetic-Dialogues Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hannah Rashkin, Eric Michael Smith, Margaret Li, and Y-Lan Boureau. *Towards empathetic open-domain conversation models: A new benchmark and dataset*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 5370–5381, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
