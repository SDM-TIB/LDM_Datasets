To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta Answering for Machine Reading" by Benjamin BÃ¶rschinger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of the **Natural Questions dataset** for evaluating the machine reading framework, which indicates that this dataset is likely important.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned. In the introduction, the authors mention that they study the performance of humans and machines on the **Natural Questions dataset** (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). This dataset is explicitly named, and I will need to gather its citation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their evaluation setup and confirm that they used the **Natural Questions dataset** for their experiments. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Natural Questions dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Kwiatkowski, T., Palomaki, J., Redfield, O., Collins, M., Parikh, A., Alberti, C., Epstein, D., Polosukhin, I., Kelcey, M., Devlin, J., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., Jones, L., Chang, M.-W., Dai, A., Uszkoreit, J., Le, Q., & Petrov, S. (2019). Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research. *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics*.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
