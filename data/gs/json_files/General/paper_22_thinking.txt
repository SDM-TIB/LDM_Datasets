To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QE BERT: Bilingual BERT using Multi-task Learning for Neural Quality Estimation" by Hyun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimentation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **WMT19 QE datasets**, which suggests that this is a key dataset to focus on.

Next, I will examine the **experimentation section** (section 3) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention that they evaluated their methods on the **WMT19 QE Shared Task** datasets for both English-Russian and English-German translation quality estimation tasks. This confirms the presence of specific datasets.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to various parallel data sources used for pre-training QE BERT, including:

1. **ParaCrawl corpus**
2. **Common Crawl corpus**
3. **News Commentary corpus**
4. **Yandex Corpus** (for English-Russian)
5. **Europarl corpus** (for English-German)
6. **Document-split Rapid corpus** (for English-German)

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The WMT19 QE datasets are typically cited as follows:

- For the **WMT19 QE Shared Task**, the citation is:
  > *Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT), Volume 3: Shared Task Papers (Day 2), pages 85–89, Florence, Italy, August 1-2, 2019. Association for Computational Linguistics.*

For the individual corpora, I will look for their respective citations:

- **ParaCrawl corpus**: 
  > *ParaCrawl. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://paracrawl.eu*

- **Common Crawl corpus**: 
  > *Common Crawl. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://commoncrawl.org*

- **News Commentary corpus**: 
  > *News Commentary. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.statmt.org/wmt19/translation-task.html*

- **Yandex Corpus**: 
  > *Yandex. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://translate.yandex.com*

- **Europarl corpus**: 
  > *Koehn, P. (2005). Europarl: A parallel corpus for statistical machine translation. In Proceedings of the 10th Machine Translation Summit, pages 79–86.*

- **Document-split Rapid corpus**: 
  > *Document-split Rapid. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.statmt.org/wmt19/translation-task.html*

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
