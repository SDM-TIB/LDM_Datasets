To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contextual Emotion Detection Using a Combination of Neural Networks and SVM" by Elham Mohammadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper focuses on contextual emotion detection in a dataset of 3-round dialogues, which suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors discuss the challenges of emotion detection in dialogues and reference the SemEval 2019 Task 3 (EmoContext), which implies that the dataset used is related to this task.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any detailed descriptions of the dataset. The authors mention that they participated in the EmoContext task, which is centered around detecting emotions in dialogues. However, I need to confirm the exact dataset used.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional information about the dataset or its characteristics. They mention achieving a micro-averaged F1 score for the three emotion classes, which indicates that they evaluated their model on a specific dataset related to the EmoContext task.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The EmoContext task is organized by Ankush Chatterjee et al., and the relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the EmoContext dataset, the citation is:
  > Ankush Chatterjee, Kedhar Nath Narahari, Meghana Joshi, and Puneet Agrawal. *SemEval-2019 Task 3: EmoContext: Contextual Emotion Detection in Text*. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, pages 153–158, June 6–7, 2019. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the required structure. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary information about the dataset used in the research paper.
