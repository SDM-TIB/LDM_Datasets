To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LXMERT: Learning Cross-Modality Encoder Representations from Transformers" by Hao Tan and Mohit Bansal, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on two visual question answering datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.1) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics.

In section 4.1, the authors mention three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **VQA v2.0**: This dataset is used for visual question answering and contains 1.1 million questions related to images, with an average of 5.4 questions per image.
   
2. **GQA**: This dataset also focuses on visual question answering but requires more reasoning skills, containing 22 million questions generated from ground truth image scene graphs.

3. **NLVR2**: This dataset is a visual reasoning dataset where each datum consists of two related images and a natural language statement. It has 86K training, 7K validation, and 7K test samples.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations I need to extract are:

- For **VQA v2.0**, the citation is:
  > Goyal, Y., Khot, T., Summers-Stay, D., Batra, D., & Parikh, D. (2017). Making the V in VQA matter: Elevating the role of image understanding in visual question answering. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 6904â€“6913.

- For **GQA**, the citation is:
  > Hudson, A. D., & Manning, C. D. (2019). GQA: A new dataset for compositional question answering over real-world images. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **NLVR2**, the citation is:
  > Suhr, A., Zhou, S., Zhang, I., Bai, H., & Artzi, Y. (2019). A corpus for reasoning about natural language grounded in photographs. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets along with their full citations as required.
