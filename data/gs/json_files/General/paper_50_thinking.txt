To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention over Heads: A Multi-Hop Attention for Neural Machine Translation" by Shohei Iiday et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the IWSLT2017 and WMT17 tasks, which suggests that these datasets are likely to be included in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **IWSLT2017 Dataset**: This dataset is used for German-English translation and contains approximately 160K training sentence pairs, 7.3K validation sentence pairs, and 6.7K test sentence pairs.

2. **WMT17 Dataset**: This dataset is also used for translation tasks and contains approximately 5.9M sentence pairs for training. The authors specify that they used newstest2013 as the validation set and newstest2014 and newstest2017 as the test sets.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The IWSLT2017 dataset is often referenced in the context of its shared task, and the WMT17 dataset is similarly well-documented in the literature.

The citations I find are:

- For **IWSLT2017**:
  > IWSLT 2017. *International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation*. Available at: https://sites.google.com/site/iwsltevaluation2017/

- For **WMT17**:
  > WMT 2017. *Conference on Machine Translation*. Available at: http://www.statmt.org/wmt17/translation-task.html

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation.

This process ensures that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for proper attribution and further research.
