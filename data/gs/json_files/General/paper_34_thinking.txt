To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Distance Relationships without Time Travel: Boosting the Performance of a Sparse Predictive Autoencoder in Sequence Modeling" by Jeremy Gordon et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset** for next word prediction, which indicates that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In **section 3 (Experiments)**, the authors describe two tasks: the **Stochastic Sequential MNIST (ssMNIST)** task and the **Penn Treebank (PTB)** dataset for language modeling. This confirms that both datasets are relevant for extraction.

In **section 3.1 (Tasks & Datasets)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the **Stochastic Sequential MNIST (ssMNIST)** task, explaining how it involves sequences of MNIST digits generated according to a specific grammar. This dataset is crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**:

1. **Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Marcus, M., Kim, G., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., MacIntyre, R., Bies, A., Ferguson, M., Katz, K., and Schasberger, B. *The Penn Treebank: Annotating Predicate Argument Structure*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Human Language Technology, 1994, Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 114â€“119.

2. **MNIST dataset** (though not explicitly cited in the references, it is a well-known dataset):
   - Citation:
     > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., and Burges, C. J. C. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that captures the essence of each dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
