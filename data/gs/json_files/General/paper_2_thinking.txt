To extract datasets from the research paper titled "R3: Reverse, Retrieve, and Rank for Sarcasm Generation with Commonsense Knowledge" by Tuhin Chakrabarty et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses related work, which may include references to datasets.

In the **experimental setup section (Section 5)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Ghosh et al. (2020) Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4,762 pairs of speakers' sarcastic messages and hearers' interpretations, collected through a crowdsourcing experiment.

2. **Peled and Reichart (2017) Dataset**: This dataset contains 3,000 sarcastic tweets, each interpreted by five human judges, and was also collected using the hashtag #sarcasm from Twitter.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Ghosh et al. (2020) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Debanjan Ghosh, Elena Musi, Kartikeya Upasani, and Smaranda Muresan. *Interpreting verbal irony: Linguistic strategies and the connection to the type of semantic incongruity*. Proceedings of the Society for Computation in Linguistics, 3(9):76–87, 2020.

- For the **Peled and Reichart (2017) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lotem Peled and Roi Reichart. *Sarcasm SIGN: Interpreting sarcasm with sentiment based monolingual machine translation*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1690–1700, Vancouver, Canada, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective references.
