To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What BERT Sees: Cross-Modal Transfer for Visual Question Generation" by Thomas Scialom et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental protocol sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on two established datasets for Visual Question Generation (VQG), which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Protocol)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **VQGCOCO**: This dataset contains 2,500 training images, 1,250 validation images, and 1,250 test images from the MS COCO dataset. Each image is associated with 5 questions and 5 ground-truth captions. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Mostafazadeh, N., Misra, I., Devlin, J., Mitchell, M., He, X., & Vanderwende, L. (2016). Generating natural questions about an image. In Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2016), Berlin, Germany.

2. **VQA1.0**: This dataset is used to derive VQG data by reversing the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA). It contains 82,783 training images, 40,504 validation images, and 81,434 testing images, with each image having 3 associated questions. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Antol, S., Agrawal, A., Lu, J., Mitchell, M., Batra, D., Zitnick, C. L., & Parikh, D. (2015). VQA: Visual Question Answering. In International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to check the **References section** of the paper to confirm the full citations for both datasets, ensuring accuracy.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for further processing or review.
