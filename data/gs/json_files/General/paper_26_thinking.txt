To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Multi-Perspective Inferrer: Reasoning Sentences Relationship from Holistic Perspective" by Zhen Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used for evaluation. 

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors might have used to validate their model. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include dataset information.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

Upon reviewing section 4.1 (Datasets), I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI)**: This dataset consists of 570,000 sentence pairs, where the premise data is drawn from the captions of the Flickr30k corpus, and the hypothesis data is manually composed. The training, development, and test datasets consist of 549,367, 9,842, and 9,824 pairs of sentences, respectively.

2. **Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI)**: This dataset contains 433,000 sentence pairs across nine genres, creating matched (in-domain) and mismatched (cross-domain) development/test sets. The authors use the official training and development sets for model selection and testing.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **SNLI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In EMNLP, 2015.

- For the **MultiNLI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel R. Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. In NAACL-HLT, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper referencing.
