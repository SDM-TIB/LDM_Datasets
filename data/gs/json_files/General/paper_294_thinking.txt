To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Insertion Transformer: Flexible Sequence Generation via Insertion Operations" by Mitchell Stern et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the Insertion Transformer and its application to the WMT 2014 English-German machine translation task. This suggests that there may be a specific dataset used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention that they validate their approach on the **WMT 2014 English-German translation dataset**. This is a clear indication that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the WMT 2014 dataset. The WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation) datasets are commonly referenced in the literature, and I will ensure to provide the correct citation.

The citation for the WMT 2014 dataset is:
> Bojar, O., et al. *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1â€“30, 2014.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **WMT 2014 English-German Translation Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the Insertion Transformer model on machine translation tasks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset and its citation, ensuring that it is ready for any further processing or review.
