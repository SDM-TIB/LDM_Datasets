To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural language understanding for task oriented dialog in the biomedical domain in a low resources context" by Antoine Neuraz et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of developing natural language processing systems in the biomedical domain due to the lack of sharable datasets, which suggests that the authors may have created or utilized specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data generation and augmentation)**, where the authors describe their approach to generating a training dataset. They mention collecting a set of **178 questions** from medical doctors, which they annotated as a gold standard. This indicates that there is a dataset created from these questions.

In **section 2.1**, the authors detail the task of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) in querying Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and mention the **336 distinct lab mentions** used in their training set. This is another dataset component that I need to document.

The authors also describe the generation of a training dataset using templates and terminologies, which includes **223 question templates** and **409 mentions of laboratory tests results**. This indicates that they created a synthetic dataset for training purposes.

In **section 3 (Experiments)**, they mention splitting the generated data into training and development sets, which further confirms the existence of these datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are generated by the authors, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

The key datasets I will extract are:

1. **Generated Training Dataset**: Composed of 16,000 utterances created from templates and augmented with paraphrases.
2. **Development Dataset**: Composed of 4,000 utterances created similarly.
3. **Gold Standard Questions**: A set of 178 annotated questions collected from medical doctors.
4. **Lab Mentions**: A list of 336 distinct lab mentions used in the training set.

Since these datasets are generated and not publicly available, I will document them as follows:

- **Generated Training Dataset**: Contains 16,000 utterances derived from 223 templates and 409 lab mentions.
- **Development Dataset**: Contains 4,000 utterances derived from the same templates and lab mentions.
- **Gold Standard Questions**: 178 questions annotated by medical doctors.
- **Lab Mentions**: 336 distinct lab mentions.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the datasets and their characteristics, ensuring to include the context of their creation as described in the paper.
