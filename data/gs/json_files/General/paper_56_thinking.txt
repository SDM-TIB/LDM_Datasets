To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Regularized Context Gates on Transformer for Machine Translation" by Xintong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that "Extensive experiments on 4 translation datasets demonstrate that the proposed model obtains an averaged gain of 1.0 BLEU score over a strong Transformer baseline." This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors mention evaluating their methods on specific datasets. In Section 3, they refer to "the proposed methods are evaluated on NIST, IWSLT14, and WMT14 tasks." This gives me the names of the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions:

1. **NIST**: The NIST datasets are commonly used for machine translation tasks, but the specific citation for the NIST datasets is not provided in this paper. I will note that the NIST datasets are widely recognized and can be referenced as:
   > NIST. *NIST Machine Translation Evaluation*. Available at: http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/tests/mt/index.html.

2. **IWSLT14**: The citation for the IWSLT14 dataset is:
   > Cettolo, M., Girardi, C., & Federico, M. (2014). *WIT3: Web Inventory of Transcribed and Translated Talks*. In Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT), pages 193–200.

3. **WMT14**: The citation for the WMT14 dataset is:
   > Bojar, O., et al. (2014). *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1–30.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their authoritative references.
