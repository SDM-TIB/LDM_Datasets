To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CRAM: Clued Recurrent Attention Model" by Minki Chung and Sungzoon Cho, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the tasks the model addresses, which hints at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors discuss the tasks they performed. In this case, they mention two tasks: image classification and inpainting. I will look for specific datasets associated with these tasks.

In the **image inpainting section**, the authors explicitly mention the **Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset**. They describe it as a real-world image dataset for object recognition, containing 73,257 training digits and 26,032 testing digits, with images sized 32x32 in RGB color scale. This is a clear indication that I have found a dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SVHN dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu, and A. Y. Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, vol. 2011, no. 2, 2011, p. 5.

Since the paper primarily discusses the SVHN dataset for the inpainting task, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly.

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that it is ready for downstream processing or review.
