To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distantly-Supervised Neural Relation Extraction with Side Information using BERT" by Johny Moreira et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using the **Google Distant Supervision** and **Riedel** datasets, which suggests that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention the two datasets:

1. **Google Distant Supervision (GDS)**: The authors describe GDS as an extension of the Google relation extraction corpus that includes additional instances from entity pairs. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **Riedel Dataset**: The authors explain that this dataset was developed by aligning Freebase relations with the New York Times corpus, specifically using sentences from 2005-2006 for training and sentences from 2007 for testing.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Google Distant Supervision**, the citation is:
  > S. Jat, S. Khandelwal, and P. Talukdar. "Improving Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction using Word and Entity Based Attention." 2018. Retrieved from http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06987.

- For **Riedel Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Riedel, L. Yao, and A. McCallum. "Modeling Relations and Their Mentions without Labeled Text." Proceedings of the 2010 European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases: Part III, pp. 148â€“163.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective references.
