To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BioFLAIR: Pretrained Pooled Contextualized Embeddings for Biomedical Sequence Labeling Tasks" by Shreyas Sharma and Ron Daniel, Jr., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of FLAIR on various bio NER tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that FLAIR has achieved state-of-the-art results on common NER datasets like CoNLL-03 and Ontonotes, but I need to find specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly where they describe the pretraining corpora and benchmark datasets. In **Table 1**, they list three corpora extracted from PubMed, which are:

1. **PubMed (V1)**: A 5% sample of PubMed abstracts until 2015, containing 1,219,734 abstracts.
2. **PubMed (V2)**: A sample of PubMed abstracts after 2000, containing 261,736 abstracts.
3. **PubMed (V3)**: Another sample of PubMed abstracts after 2000, containing 281,394 abstracts.

In **Table 2**, the authors provide a list of benchmark corpora used for evaluation, which includes:

1. **NCBI-disease**: Contains 7,287 sentences related to disease entities.
2. **BC5CDR-disease**: Contains 15,030 sentences related to disease entities.
3. **BC5CDR**: Contains 15,030 sentences related to disease and drug/chemical entities.
4. **JNLPBA**: Contains 24,806 sentences related to gene/protein entities.
5. **Species-800**: Contains 8,193 sentences related to species entities.
6. **LINNAEUS**: Contains 23,152 sentences related to species entities.

The **results section** confirms that these datasets were used for evaluation, providing further validation of their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
