To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "VAE-PGN based Abstractive Model in Multi-stage Architecture for Text Summarization" by Hyungtak Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on the **benchmark Reddit corpus** as part of the TL;DR challenge, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **TL;DR Reddit corpus**: This dataset consists of approximately 3 million content-summary pairs mined from Reddit. It is specifically noted as the dataset for the TL;DR challenge, which is relevant for the evaluation of their summarization model.

2. **CNN/Daily Mail corpus**: The authors specify that they used the non-anonymized version of this dataset, which contains pairs of online news articles and their summaries. The dataset includes approximately 287,000 training pairs, 13,368 validation pairs, and 11,490 testing pairs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **TL;DR Reddit corpus**, the citation is:
  > Michael Völke, Martin Potthast, Shahbaz Syed, and Benno Stein. *TL;DR: Mining Reddit to learn automatic summarization*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on New Frontiers in Summarization, pages 59–63, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2017. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **CNN/Daily Mail corpus**, the citation is:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomás Kociský, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. CoRR, abs/1506.03340, 2015.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference or processing.
