To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal Transforming Geometric Network" by Jin Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the Universal Transforming Geometric Network (UTGN) and its performance improvements, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of protein structure prediction and mention existing methods. However, I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section (Section 3)**, the authors mention using the **CASP12 ProteinNet dataset** for evaluation. They describe it as consisting of around 50,000 structures and note that it includes both training and validation sets, as well as test targets from the CASP12 competition. This is a key dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CASP12 ProteinNet dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **CASP12 ProteinNet dataset**:
  > Mohammed AlQuraishi. Proteinnet: a standardized data set for machine learning of protein structure. In BMC Bioinformatics, 2019b.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will summarize it as follows:

1. **CASP12 ProteinNet dataset**: A dataset used for training and evaluating protein structure prediction models, consisting of around 50,000 structures.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes ensuring that the citation is complete and correctly formatted.

In conclusion, I have successfully extracted the dataset from the paper, ensuring to include the full citation for proper attribution.
