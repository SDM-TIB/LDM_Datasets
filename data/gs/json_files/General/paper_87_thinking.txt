To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Attentional Speech Recognition Models Misbehave on Out-of-Domain Utterances" by Phillip Keung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors discuss the use of the British National Corpus (BNC) and the LibriSpeech corpus, which suggests that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods** section, specifically **section 2.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **LibriSpeech Corpus**: This dataset is described as containing 960 hours of audio from US English speakers reading passages from public domain books. It is crucial to note the specific details provided about the dataset.

2. **British National Corpus (BNC)**: The authors explain that this corpus includes spontaneous conversations from UK English speakers, collected in the early 1990s. They also mention the selection process for the utterances used in their study, which adds context to the dataset's application.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **LibriSpeech Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2015.

- For the **British National Corpus**, the citation is:
  > John Coleman, Ladan Baghai-Ravary, John Pybus, and Sergio Grau. *Audio BNC: The audio edition of the spoken British National Corpus*. Phonetics Laboratory, University of Oxford, 2012.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation, ready for inclusion in any relevant output or documentation.
