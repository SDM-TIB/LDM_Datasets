To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Do deep reinforcement learning agents model intentions?" by Tambet Matiisen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction discusses a cooperative navigation task, which may imply the use of a specific dataset or experimental setup.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup in detail. They mention that their experiments are based on a cooperative navigation task from a referenced work ([9]). This indicates that there is a foundational dataset or task that they are using, which I need to identify.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss their findings related to the performance of agents in the navigation task. They refer to the "cooperative navigation task" but do not provide a specific dataset name. However, they do cite the original work ([9]) that describes the task, which likely includes the dataset used for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the work referenced as [9]. This is crucial because it will provide the authoritative source for the dataset used in the experiments. The reference is:

- **Multi-agent actor-critic for mixed cooperative-competitive environments**: 
  > Lowe, R., Wu, Y., Tamar, A., Harb, J., Abbeel, O. P., & Mordatch, I. (2017). In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), pages 6382â€“6393.

Since the paper does not explicitly name a dataset beyond the cooperative navigation task, I will treat the task itself as the dataset context, linking it to the original work that describes it.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the referenced work that describes the dataset used in the experiments. This will ensure that the dataset extraction is complete and properly documented.
