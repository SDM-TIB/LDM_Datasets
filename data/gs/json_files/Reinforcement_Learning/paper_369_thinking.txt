To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advances in Experience Replay" by Hima Tammineedi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of various experience replay techniques in OpenAI Gym environments, which suggests that specific datasets or environments may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section** where the authors describe the environments used for testing their experience replay techniques. They mention testing on several OpenAI Gym environments, which are crucial for identifying the datasets.

In the **methodology section**, the authors specifically mention the following environments:

1. **CartPole-v0**: This environment is a classic control task where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart. The dataset here consists of the state and action sequences generated during the training episodes.

2. **MountainCar-v0**: This environment involves a car that must build momentum to reach the top of a hill. The dataset includes the state observations and actions taken during the episodes.

3. **LunarLander-v2**: This environment requires the agent to land a spacecraft on a designated pad. The dataset consists of state observations, actions, and rewards received throughout the training episodes.

4. **Pendulum-v0**: This environment features a pendulum that needs to be balanced upright. The dataset includes the state observations and actions taken to control the pendulum.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for each environment, which further confirms that these environments are indeed the datasets they utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. However, since these environments are part of the OpenAI Gym library, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will refer to the OpenAI Gym documentation for the environments:

- **OpenAI Gym**: The environments used in this research can be cited as:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01549.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym environments as they are the primary datasets used in the experiments. 

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
