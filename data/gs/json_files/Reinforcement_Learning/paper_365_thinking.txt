To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning based QoS/QoE-aware Service Function Chaining in Software-Driven 5G Slices" by Xi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used for their experiments, including any relevant details such as the size, type, and characteristics of the datasets.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any references to datasets related to **QoS (Quality of Service)** or **QoE (Quality of Experience)**, as these are central themes of the research. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "QoS over LLDP," I will look for its citation in the references. If it is a well-known dataset, I will ensure to provide the original source or paper where it was introduced.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
