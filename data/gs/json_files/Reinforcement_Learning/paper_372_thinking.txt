To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dialogue Systems with Large Action Spaces" by Gellért Weisz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of deep reinforcement learning in dialogue systems, which may imply the use of specific datasets for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors refer to any established datasets, I will note these down.

In the **results section**, I will check if the authors provide any additional context or details about the datasets used, such as performance metrics or comparisons with other methods. This may help in understanding the significance of the datasets in the context of their research.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Cambridge Restaurants dataset**, I will look for the original citation, which might be something like:
> Ultes, S., Rojas-Barahona, L. M., Su, P.-H., Vandyke, D., Kim, D., Casanueva, I., Budzianowski, P., Mrkšić, N., Wen, T.-H., Gasic, M., & Young, S. J. (2017). PyDial: A Multi-Domain Statistical Dialogue System Toolkit. In ACL Demo.

If they mention another dataset, such as the **DSTC dataset**, I will find its citation as well:
> Henderson, M., Thomson, B., & Young, S. (2014). The Second Dialog State Tracking Challenge. In Proceedings of the 15th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is essential for academic integrity and for others who may wish to use the datasets in their own research.
