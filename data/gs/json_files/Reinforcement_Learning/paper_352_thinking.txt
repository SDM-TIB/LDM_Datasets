To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Transferable Architectures for Scalable Image Recognition" by Barret Zoph et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** and the **ImageNet dataset**, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they explicitly mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for architecture search and the **ImageNet dataset** for evaluating the performance of the architectures. This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their research.

In **section 4.1 (Results on CIFAR-10 Image Classification)**, the authors provide details about the CIFAR-10 dataset, stating it consists of 60,000 32x32 RGB images across 10 classes. They also mention the performance metrics achieved on this dataset, which further emphasizes its importance in their study.

In **section 4.2 (Results on ImageNet Image Classification)**, the authors discuss their experiments on the ImageNet dataset, which consists of approximately 1.2 million images labeled across 1,000 classes. They report state-of-the-art performance metrics achieved on this dataset as well.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

2. **ImageNet Dataset**:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
