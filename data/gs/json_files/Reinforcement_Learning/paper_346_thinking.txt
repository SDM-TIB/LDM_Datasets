To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Search in Long Documents Using Document Structure" by Mor Geva and Jonathan Berant, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset called **TRIVIAQA**, which is a good indication that there are datasets involved in the research. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges of reading comprehension models and hints at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section, which is often where authors describe the datasets they used in their experiments. In this paper, the relevant information is found in **section 3 (Data)**. Here, the authors discuss two datasets:

1. **TRIVIAQA**: This dataset contains question-answer pairs along with documents that contain the answers. It is noted for its large scale and complexity, making it suitable for the authors' research.

2. **TRIVIAQA-NOP**: This is a modified version of the TRIVIAQA dataset, where the preface section of each document has been removed to reduce bias towards answers appearing early in the document. The authors provide detailed statistics about this dataset, including the number of questions and documents.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **TRIVIAQA**, the citation is:
> Joshi, M., Choi, E., Weld, D. J., & Zettlemoyer, L. (2017). TriviaQA: A large scale distantly supervised challenge dataset for reading comprehension. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 1601â€“1611.

For **TRIVIAQA-NOP**, since it is derived from TRIVIAQA, I will use the same citation as it is based on the original dataset.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
