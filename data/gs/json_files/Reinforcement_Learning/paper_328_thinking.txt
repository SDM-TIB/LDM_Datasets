To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Faster Deep Q-learning using Neural Episodic Control" by Daichi Nishio and Satoshi Yamane, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments** or **implementation** sections. These sections typically detail the methodologies used, including any datasets employed for training or evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Pong** game from the **Atari 2600** as the environment for their experiments. This indicates that the dataset consists of game frames and associated rewards.

I will also check the **results** and **conclusion** sections to see if the authors discuss the datasets further or provide any additional context about their use. The results section may contain performance metrics that relate to the datasets, while the conclusion might summarize the findings and their implications.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset used. In this case, since the paper uses the **Pong** game from the **OpenAI Gym**, I will look for the appropriate citation for OpenAI Gym.

The citation for OpenAI Gym is:
> Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Pong (Atari 2600)
   - **Description**: The dataset consists of game frames and rewards from the Pong game, which is used to evaluate the proposed reinforcement learning algorithm.
   - **Full Citation**: Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

With this information, I am ready to compile the dataset entry into the required format for further processing or review.
