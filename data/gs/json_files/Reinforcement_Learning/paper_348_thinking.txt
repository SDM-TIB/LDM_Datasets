To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Episodic Memory Deep Q-Networks" by Zichuan Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, EMDQN, is evaluated on Atari games, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these games.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors state that they evaluated their algorithm using the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, which is a framework that includes a suite of Atari games. This indicates that the dataset used for evaluation is related to the games available in ALE.

I will also check the **background** and **related work sections** to see if there are any other datasets mentioned or referenced. However, the primary dataset appears to be the one associated with the Arcade Learning Environment.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment. The relevant citation is:

- **Arcade Learning Environment**:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253â€“279.

Since the paper primarily discusses the use of the Arcade Learning Environment for evaluating the EMDQN algorithm, I will focus on this dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
