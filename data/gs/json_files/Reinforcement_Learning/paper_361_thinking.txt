To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discrete Sequential Prediction of Continuous Actions for Deep RL" by Luke Metz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are foundational to their research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

In the **methodology** section, I will pay close attention to any subsections that describe the experimental setup or data collection processes. This is where the authors typically detail the datasets they used, including any preprocessing steps or specific characteristics of the data.

I will also examine the **experiments section**, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and testing the models. The authors may provide insights into the size, structure, and source of the datasets here.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Mujoco environments** for their experiments, I would look for the citation related to Mujoco in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on, pp. 5026â€“5033. IEEE, 2012.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper citations for future reference.
