To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Value Iteration Networks: Life Beyond Lattices" by Sufeng Niu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may highlight the datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant subsections within the **methodology** or **experimental results** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments on various types of graphs, including synthetic 2D mazes, irregular graphs, and real-world street networks. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experimental results** section, the authors mention using two real-world maps: the **Minnesota highway map** and the **New York City street map**. I will note the details provided about these datasets, such as the number of nodes and edges, as well as any performance metrics reported.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the datasets identified, I will compile the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., number of nodes, edges, or clips).
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset as found in the references section.

Based on the information gathered, I will ensure that each dataset is accurately documented with its full citation, which is essential for academic integrity and reproducibility.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Search for a dedicated datasets section or relevant mentions in methodology and experimental results.
3. Document the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations from the references section.
4. Compile the information in a structured format for clarity and ease of use.
