To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Distributional Deterministic Policy Gradients" by Gabriel Barth-Maron et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the D4PG algorithm and its performance across various control tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using a **standard control suite** developed in the MuJoCo physics simulator. This indicates that the datasets are likely related to control tasks in a simulated environment.

I will look for specific names of datasets or benchmarks within the **results section** and any associated figures or tables that might provide more context. The authors mention various tasks such as "Acrobot," "Cartpole," "Cheetah," and "Humanoid," which are part of the control suite. I will need to confirm if these tasks correspond to specific datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper references the following key works that describe the datasets:

1. **MuJoCo Physics Simulator**: The citation for the MuJoCo simulator is:
   > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on, pp. 5026–5033, IEEE, 2012.

2. **DeepMind Control Suite**: The citation for the control suite is:
   > Yuval Tassa, Yotam Doron, Alistair Muldal, Tom Erez, Yazhe Li, Diego de Las Casas, David Budden, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Josh Merel, Andrew Lefrancq, Timothy Lillicrap, and Martin Riedmiller. *DeepMind control suite*, 2018. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00690.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

- **Dataset 1**: Standard Control Suite (MuJoCo)
  - Description: A suite of benchmark tasks for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms, including tasks like Acrobot, Cartpole, and Cheetah.
  - Citation: Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on, pp. 5026–5033, IEEE, 2012.

- **Dataset 2**: DeepMind Control Suite
  - Description: A collection of continuous control tasks designed for benchmarking reinforcement learning algorithms.
  - Citation: Yuval Tassa, Yotam Doron, Alistair Muldal, Tom Erez, Yazhe Li, Diego de Las Casas, David Budden, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Josh Merel, Andrew Lefrancq, Timothy Lillicrap, and Martin Riedmiller. *DeepMind control suite*, 2018. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00690.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
