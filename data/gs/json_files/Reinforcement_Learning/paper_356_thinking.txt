To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IMPALA: Scalable Distributed Deep-RL with Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architectures" by Lasse Espeholt et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of IMPALA on **DMLab-30** and **Atari-57**, indicating that these are datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5, the authors describe their experiments and explicitly mention the datasets:

1. **DMLab-30**: This is a set of 30 diverse tasks built on the DeepMind Lab environment. The paper states that it includes visually complex environments and various cognitive tasks.

2. **Atari-57**: This dataset consists of all available Atari games in the Arcade Learning Environment. The authors mention that they trained agents on all 57 Atari games simultaneously.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DMLab-30**, the citation is:
  > Beattie, C., Leibo, J. Z., Teplyashin, D., Ward, T., Wainwright, M., Kuttler, H., Lefrancq, A., Green, S., Valdes, V., Sadik, A., Schrittwieser, J., Anderson, K., York, S., Cant, M., Cain, A., Bolton, A., Gaffney, S., King, H., Hassabis, D., Legg, S., and Petersen, S. *DeepMind Lab*. CoRR, abs/1612.03801, 2016.

- For **Atari-57**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, June 2013.

With these citations, I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets used in the paper. I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
