To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Semantic Alignment for Improved Image Captions" by Pierre Dognin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new diagnostic dataset called the **Out of Context (OOC) test set**, which is a key dataset for evaluating the model's generalization capabilities.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methods. Here, they mention using the **MS-COCO dataset** for training and evaluation, which is a well-known dataset in the image captioning domain.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide details about the **semantic score** and how it relates to the COCO dataset, confirming its use in their experiments. They also discuss the OOC set, which was expanded from an original set of 218 images to 269 images, with 5 captions per image collected via Amazon MTurk.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. **MS-COCO Dataset**: The citation for the COCO dataset is:
   > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S. J., Bourdev, L. D., Girshick, R., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Doll√°r, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

2. **Out of Context (OOC) Test Set**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for the OOC set since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper. However, I will note that it is derived from the original set of images mentioned in the paper.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **MS-COCO Dataset**: A large-scale dataset containing images with multiple captions, widely used for training and evaluating image captioning models.
- **Out of Context (OOC) Test Set**: A diagnostic dataset created to evaluate the model's ability to generalize to images with objects that do not typically co-occur.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
