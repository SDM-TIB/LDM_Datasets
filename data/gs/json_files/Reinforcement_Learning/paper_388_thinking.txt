To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pretraining Deep Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning Algorithms With Expert Demonstrations" by Xiaoqin Zhang and Huimin Ma, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of expert demonstrations in reinforcement learning, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, particularly those related to the expert demonstrations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention applying their methods to two types of environments: **MuJoCo simulation environments** and **Atari games**. I will look for specific datasets or environments that are explicitly named.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail their experiments with DDPG and ACER algorithms on various tasks. They mention specific tasks for the MuJoCo environments: **HalfCheetah, Hopper, and Walker2d**. For the Atari games, they list **AirRaid, Breakout, Carnival, CrazyClimber, and Gopher**. These tasks serve as the datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. However, since these environments are widely recognized benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community, I will provide the citations for the original papers or sources that introduced these environments:

1. **MuJoCo**:
   > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on, pages 5026–5033. IEEE, 2012.

2. **Atari Games**:
   > Volodymyr Mnih, Koray Kavukcuoglu, David Silver, Andrei A Rusu, Joel Veness, Marc G Bellemare, Alex Graves, Martin Riedmiller, Andreas K Fidjeland, Georg Ostrovski, et al. *Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning*. Nature, 518(7540):529–533, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
