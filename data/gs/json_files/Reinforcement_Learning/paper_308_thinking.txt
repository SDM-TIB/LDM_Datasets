To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STMARL: A Spatio-Temporal Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach for Cooperative Traffic Light Control" by Yanan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are based on both synthetic and real-world data, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe two real-world datasets used for their experiments:

1. **DHangzhou**: This dataset is publicly available for the city of Hangzhou, China, and consists of a 4 × 4 grid road structure with traffic flow data recorded over one hour.

2. **DHefei**: This dataset is collected from Hefei, China, and includes data from four heterogeneous intersections, with vehicle and road information recorded by cameras over a specific time period from November 6 to November 12, 2018.

Additionally, the authors mention synthetic datasets generated for testing their model, specifically:
- **Unidirec6×6**: A synthetic dataset representing a 6 × 6 grid network with unidirectional traffic.
- **Bidirect6×6**: A synthetic dataset representing a 6 × 6 grid network with bidirectional traffic.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are either publicly available or generated for the study, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. I will note the relevant details for each dataset as follows:

- For **DHangzhou**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Y., Xu, T., Niu, X., Tan, C., Chen, E., & Xiong, H. (2018). *STMARL: A Spatio-Temporal Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach for Cooperative Traffic Light Control*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems.

- For **DHefei**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Y., Xu, T., Niu, X., Tan, C., Chen, E., & Xiong, H. (2018). *STMARL: A Spatio-Temporal Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach for Cooperative Traffic Light Control*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems.

- For **Unidirec6×6** and **Bidirect6×6**, since they are synthetic datasets generated for the experiments, they may not have formal citations. I will note them as part of the experimental setup.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable, and prepare them for structured output.
