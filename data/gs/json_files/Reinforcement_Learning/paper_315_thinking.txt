To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FinRL: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Library for Automated Stock Trading in Quantitative Finance" by Xiao-Yang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the FinRL library incorporates stock market datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The Proposed FinRL Library)**, particularly **subsection 3.2 (Environment: Time-driven Trading Simulator)**, where the authors describe the trading environments. Here, they mention that the library provides six environments based on representative listings, including:

1. **NASDAQ-100**
2. **DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average)**
3. **S&P 500**
4. **SSE 50 (Shanghai Stock Exchange 50)**
5. **CSI 300 (China Securities Index 300)**
6. **HSI (Hang Seng Index)**

The paper also notes that there is a user-defined environment, allowing users to import their own datasets.

In **subsection 3.2.2 (Standard and User Import Datasets)**, the authors clarify that the FinRL library is designed to facilitate the use of these datasets for training trading agents. They emphasize that users can adjust the granularity of time steps and specify the format of their data according to the library's instructions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the stock market indices themselves, as they are commonly known datasets. Instead, I will note that these indices are widely used in financial research and can be referenced as follows:

- **NASDAQ-100**: This index includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the NASDAQ stock market.
- **DJIA**: The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a stock market index that indicates the value of 30 large, publicly-owned companies based in the United States.
- **S&P 500**: The Standard & Poor's 500 is a stock market index that measures the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.
- **SSE 50**: The SSE 50 Index consists of the 50 largest stocks on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
- **CSI 300**: This index tracks the performance of the top 300 stocks traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.
- **HSI**: The Hang Seng Index is a market capitalization-weighted index of the largest companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Since these datasets are standard financial indices, they do not have specific authors or publication years like traditional datasets. However, I will ensure to mention their significance and common usage in financial research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the datasets used in the FinRL library, ensuring that each entry includes a description and the relevant citations where applicable.
