To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MOVI: A Model-Free Approach to Dynamic Fleet Management" by Takuma Oda and Carlee Joe-Wong, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. In the abstract, the authors refer to a "large-scale realistic simulator based on 15 million taxi trip records." This indicates that there is a dataset involved, and I need to find more details about it.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. The **introduction** mentions the use of "15.6 million New York City taxi records" and "Open Street Map road data." This gives me two potential datasets to document.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the section discussing the MOVI fleet simulator, the authors elaborate on the dataset used for training and testing. They specify that they used "12.8 million trip records from May 2016 to train the simulator and 2.8 million trip records from June 2016 for testing." This provides clear information about the dataset's size and the time period it covers.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the source of the taxi trip records as follows:

- For the **New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission trip records**, the citation is:
  > New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. *Trip Record Data*. Available at: http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml

- The **OpenStreetMap data** is cited as:
  > OpenStreetMap. Available at: https://www.openstreetmap.org

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **New York City Taxi Trip Records**: This dataset consists of 15.6 million records, with 12.8 million used for training and 2.8 million for testing. It includes pickup and drop-off dates/times, locations, and travel distances for each trip.

2. **Open Street Map Road Data**: This dataset provides the road network information used in the simulator.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference or analysis.
