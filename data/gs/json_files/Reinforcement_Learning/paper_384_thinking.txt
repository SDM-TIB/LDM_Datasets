To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Noisy Networks for Exploration" by Meire Fortunato et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of NoisyNet and its application to various Atari games, which suggests that datasets related to these games may be involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically provides details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on **57 Atari games**, which indicates that the Atari game environment serves as the dataset for their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Atari dataset. The relevant citation for the Atari games is:

- **Atari Learning Environment**: 
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2015). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. In *Twenty-Fourth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence*.

Since the paper does not mention any additional datasets beyond the Atari games, I will compile the information I have gathered.

Now, I will create an entry for the Atari dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing, containing the relevant dataset information extracted from the paper.
