To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Memory Lens: How Much Memory Does an Agent Use?" by Christoph Dann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets or experimental setups that involve data collection. The abstract discusses estimating memory use in reinforcement learning policies and mentions analyzing DQN policies on Atari games, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these games.

Next, I will examine the **experimental results section** (Section 4) in detail. This section describes the training of Deep Q-Network (DQN) policies on 49 Atari games. I will look for any specific datasets or sources of data mentioned in this context. The authors state that they recorded 10,000 games played by each of the fully trained policies, which indicates that the dataset consists of gameplay data from these Atari games.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. The paper does not explicitly mention a dataset name for the Atari games, but it does refer to the original work on DQN policies by Mnih et al. (2015), which is crucial for understanding the context of the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Atari 2600 Games Dataset**: This dataset consists of gameplay data from 49 Atari 2600 games, used to analyze the memory capacity of DQN policies. The dataset includes trajectories of actions taken by the agent during gameplay.

The citation for the DQN policies and the Atari dataset is:
> Volodymyr Mnih, Koray Kavukcuoglu, David Silver, Andrei a Rusu, Joel Veness, Marc G Bellemare, Alex Graves, Martin Riedmiller, Andreas K Fidjeland, Georg Ostrovski, Stig Petersen, Charles Beattie, Amir Sadik, Ioannis Antonoglou, Helen King, Dharshan Kumaran, Daan Wierstra, Shane Legg, and Demis Hassabis. *Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning*. Nature, 518(7540):529â€“533, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their citations before proceeding to format them according to the required structure.
