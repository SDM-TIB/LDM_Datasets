To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shallow Updates for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Nir Levine et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract discusses testing the LS-DQN algorithm on **five Atari games**, which suggests that these games may be part of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), particularly **subsection 4.2 (Atari Experiments)**, where the authors detail the specific Atari games used for their experiments. The paper mentions that the LS-DQN algorithm was tested on the following five Atari domains:

1. **Asterix**
2. **Space Invaders**
3. **Breakout**
4. **Q-Bert**
5. **Bowling**

These games are part of the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), which is a well-known benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The Atari games are part of the Arcade Learning Environment, and the relevant citation for this dataset is:

- For the **Arcade Learning Environment**:
  > Bellemare, Marc G., Naddaf, Yavar, Veness, Joel, and Bowling, Michael. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253–279, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Atari Games (Asterix, Space Invaders, Breakout, Q-Bert, Bowling)**:
   - Citation: Bellemare, Marc G., Naddaf, Yavar, Veness, Joel, and Bowling, Michael. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253–279, 2013.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future reference or analysis.
