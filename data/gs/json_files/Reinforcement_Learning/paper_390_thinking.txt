To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive coordination of working-memory and reinforcement learning in non-human primates performing a trial-and-error problem solving task" by Guillaume Viejo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that describe the experimental setup and data collection. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in the context of the trial-and-error problem-solving task.

In this paper, the authors describe the behavior of five monkeys and their performance in a specific task. However, they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets or provide references to datasets used in their analysis. Instead, they focus on the experimental design and the computational models applied to the data collected from the monkeys.

Since there are no specific datasets cited in the paper, I will check the **references section** to see if any previous studies or datasets are referenced that could be relevant to the research. This may include studies that have used similar methodologies or datasets that could provide context for the current research.

After reviewing the references, I will compile any relevant citations that may pertain to datasets used in similar studies or methodologies. If no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper or references, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will ensure that I write the full citations for any datasets or related studies I find, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the methods section for detailed descriptions of data collection.
3. Check the references for any relevant datasets or studies.
4. Compile and write full citations for any datasets or related studies found.
5. Note if no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper.

This structured approach will help ensure that I thoroughly extract and document any datasets referenced in the research paper.
