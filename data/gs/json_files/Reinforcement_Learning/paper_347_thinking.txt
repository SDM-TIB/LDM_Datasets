To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReGAN: RE[LAX|BAR|INFORCE] based Sequence Generation using GANs" by Aparna Balagopalan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets used. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of generating meaningful text sequences but do not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two synthetic datasets with simple grammar rules:

1. **Dataset with Sequence Length Three**: This dataset consists of sequences generated by alternating between the symbol "x" and operators (+, -, *, /). It has a vocabulary size of five and contains 10,000 sequences of length three.

2. **Dataset with Sequence Length Fifteen**: Similar to the first dataset, this one also consists of sequences generated with the same grammar rules but has sequences of length fifteen, also containing 10,000 sequences.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to these datasets. However, since these datasets are synthetic and created for the purpose of the experiments, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Therefore, I will note that these datasets are original to the authors' work and do not have external citations.

Now, I will summarize the findings for each dataset:

- For the **Dataset with Sequence Length Three**, I will note that it is an original dataset created by the authors, consisting of 10,000 sequences of length three.

- For the **Dataset with Sequence Length Fifteen**, I will similarly note that it is also an original dataset created by the authors, consisting of 10,000 sequences of length fifteen.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring to highlight that these datasets are original contributions of the authors and do not have external citations.
