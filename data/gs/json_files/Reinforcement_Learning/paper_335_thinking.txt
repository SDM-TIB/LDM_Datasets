To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implementing the Deep Q-Network" by Melrose Roderick et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the implementation of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) and references the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) as a framework used for training. This suggests that ALE may be a dataset or environment relevant to the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments and results sections** to identify any specific datasets or environments used in the experiments. In the introduction, the authors mention that they replicated results on Atari 2600 video games, which indicates that the datasets are likely the games themselves.

In the **Machine Learning Libraries section**, the authors explicitly mention using the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) for running and interacting with Atari video games. This is a crucial point as it indicates that ALE is a dataset or environment used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). The citation provided in the paper is:
> M. G. Bellemare, Y. Naddaf, J. Veness, and M. Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 06 2013.

Additionally, I will note that the authors also mention using the Brown-UMBC Reinforcement Learning and Planning (BURLAP) library, but this is a library rather than a dataset.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: This is the primary dataset/environment used for training and evaluating the DQN implementation. It provides a framework for interacting with various Atari games.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
