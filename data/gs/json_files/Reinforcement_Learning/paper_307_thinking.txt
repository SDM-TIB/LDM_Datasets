To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving QSAT problems with neural MCTS" by Ruiyang Xu and Karl Lieberherr, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will look for any references to datasets in the **introduction**. This section discusses the application of neural MCTS to solve QSAT problems but does not specify any datasets either. Therefore, I will continue to the **experiments** section, as this is where datasets are typically detailed.

In **section 5 (Experiment)**, I will focus on the subsections that describe the experimental setup and the data used. Here, the authors mention generating **20 random QBFs (10 solvable and 10 unsolvable)** for their experiments. This indicates that the dataset consists of these generated QBFs, which are used to evaluate the performance of the neural MCTS algorithm.

Since the paper does not provide a formal dataset citation for the generated QBFs, I will note that the authors created these datasets specifically for their experiments. I will also check the **References section** to see if there are any related works that might provide context or methodologies for generating similar datasets.

After reviewing the references, I find that there are no specific citations for the datasets used in this paper, as they are original to the authors' experiments. However, I will still document the details of the dataset as follows:

1. **Generated QBFs**: The dataset consists of 20 random QBFs, which include 10 solvable and 10 unsolvable instances. Each QBF is represented in a specific format (QDIMACS) and is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Since there are no external datasets cited in the paper, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have accurately captured the details of the generated dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset description and any relevant citations, even if they are not traditional datasets from external sources.
