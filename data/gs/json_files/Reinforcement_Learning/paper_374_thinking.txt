To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LADDER: A Human-Level Bidding Agent for Large-Scale Real-Time Online Auctions" by Yu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the LADDER agent's performance in JD.com’s online RTB advertising business, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction provides context about the challenges in real-time bidding but also does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**. This section typically contains details about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics. 

Upon reviewing the **experimental results**, I find that the authors mention using data generated by the ECPM policy of the hybrid system for training LADDER. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations. Instead, they describe the data as coming from JD.com’s DSP business, which is a proprietary dataset.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets or their citations, I will note that the primary dataset used is the internal data from JD.com’s DSP system, which is not publicly available. 

To summarize, I will document the following:

1. **JD.com DSP Data**: This dataset is derived from JD.com’s real-time bidding advertising business, used for training and evaluating the LADDER agent. However, it lacks a formal citation as it is proprietary data.

Since there are no formal citations for datasets in this paper, I will conclude that the only dataset mentioned is proprietary and does not have a publicly available reference. 

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.
