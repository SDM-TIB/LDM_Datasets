To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tactics of Adversarial Attack on Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents" by Yen-Chen Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses two tactics of adversarial attacks but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the context of deep reinforcement learning and the vulnerability of agents to adversarial attacks, but again, there are no specific datasets mentioned.

I will then move to the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **Section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, they mention that they evaluated their tactics on **5 Atari games**: Ms. Pacman, Pong, Seaquest, Qbert, and ChopperCommand. This indicates that the datasets used for their experiments are the environments of these Atari games.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section**. The Atari games are part of the OpenAI Gym, which is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. The relevant citation for the OpenAI Gym is:

- **OpenAI Gym**: 
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*, 2016. [Link to the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540).

Since the authors did not provide specific dataset citations for each game but referenced the OpenAI Gym, I will use this citation to represent the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Atari Games Dataset**: This dataset consists of the environments of five Atari games used for evaluating the adversarial attack tactics.
   - Citation:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
