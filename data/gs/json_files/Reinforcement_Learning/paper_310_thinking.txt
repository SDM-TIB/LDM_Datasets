To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IA-GCN: Interpretable Attention based Graph Convolutional Network for Disease prediction" by Anees Kazi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors state that they show the application of their model on two publicly available datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. Here, the authors mention that their model is applied to the **Tadpole** and **UK Biobank (UKBB)** datasets for tasks related to disease, age, and gender prediction. This gives me the names of the datasets I need to focus on.

Moving on to the **experiments** section, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets. The authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **Tadpole Dataset**: This dataset is used for Alzheimer’s disease prediction and consists of 564 patients classified into three categories (Normal, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer’s). Each patient has 354 multi-modal features, including cognitive tests, MRI ROIs, PET imaging, and demographics.

2. **UK Biobank (UKBB)**: This dataset includes 14,503 patients with 440 features per individual, extracted from MRI and fMRI images. The authors mention two classification tasks for this dataset: gender prediction and age prediction, where ages are categorized into four decades.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Tadpole Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marinescu, R., Oxtoby, N., Young, A., Bron, E., Toga, A., Weiner, M., Barkhof, F., Fox, N., Klein, S. (2018). *Tadpole challenge: Prediction of longitudinal evolution in Alzheimer’s disease*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.03909.

- For the **UK Biobank (UKBB)**, the citation is:
  > Miller, K.L., Alfaro-Almagro, F., Bangerter, N.K., Thomas, D.L., Yacoub, E., Xu, J., Bartsch, A.J., Jbabdi, S., Sotiropoulos, S.N., Andersson, J.L., et al. (2016). *Multimodal population brain imaging in the UK Biobank prospective epidemiological study*. Nature neuroscience, 19(11), 1523.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
