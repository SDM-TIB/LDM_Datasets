To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature Control as Intrinsic Motivation for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning" by Nat Dilokthanakul et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various Atari games, which suggests that datasets related to these games may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors describe their experiments. They mention evaluating their model on several Atari games, specifically noting the use of the **OpenAI Gym environment** and the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**. This indicates that the datasets used for training and evaluation are likely derived from these environments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specifically mention the following games:
1. **Montezuma's Revenge**
2. **Frostbite**
3. **Q*bert**
4. **Ms. Pac-Man**
5. **Asterix**
6. **Zaxxon**

These games are part of the Atari suite, which is commonly used in reinforcement learning research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets or environments used. The relevant citations for the datasets are:

- For the **OpenAI Gym**:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

- For the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47, 253-279.

With these citations, I can now compile the dataset entries. The datasets are derived from the environments used in the experiments, specifically the Atari games accessed through the OpenAI Gym and ALE.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry is documented with the full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
