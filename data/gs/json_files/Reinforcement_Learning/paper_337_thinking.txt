To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Quantile Regression" by Will Dabney et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed algorithm on **Atari 2600 games**, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**, where the authors describe their evaluations. They specifically mention using the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, which is a framework that includes a collection of Atari 2600 games. This indicates that the dataset consists of various games from this environment.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment. The relevant citation is:

- **Arcade Learning Environment**: 
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors do not specify any other datasets beyond the Atari games, so I will conclude that the primary dataset used for evaluation is the collection of games from the Arcade Learning Environment.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. The final output will consist of the dataset name and its corresponding citation, ready for further processing or review.
