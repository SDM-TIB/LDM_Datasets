To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GEP-PG: Decoupling Exploration and Exploitation in Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms" by CÃ©dric Colas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the GEP-PG approach on two benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the performance of their method on various benchmarks. They specifically mention using the **Continuous Mountain Car (CMC)** and **Half-Cheetah (HC)** environments for evaluation. This indicates that these environments are likely datasets or benchmarks used in their experiments.

In the **methods section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of these environments. The authors provide a thorough explanation of both benchmarks:

1. **Continuous Mountain Car (CMC)**: This environment is described as a control benchmark with deceptive reward properties, where the agent must reach a goal while managing energy penalties. The state space is defined, and the challenges of exploration in this context are highlighted.

2. **Half-Cheetah (HC)**: This benchmark involves a 2D bipedal body with articulated links, where the agent's performance is evaluated based on its ability to move efficiently. The authors describe the state and action spaces, as well as the reward structure.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations related to these benchmarks. However, since these environments are standard benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note their common usage in the literature.

For the **Continuous Mountain Car**, the relevant citation is:
> Sutton, Richard S. and Barto, Andrew G. *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*. MIT Press, 1998.

For the **Half-Cheetah**, the citation is:
> Brockman, Greg, Cheung, Vicki, Pettersson, Ludwig, Schneider, Jonas, Schulman, John, Tang, Jie, and Zaremba, Wojciech. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
