To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Surrogate Agent-Environment Interface" by Song Wang and Yu Jing, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and its performance, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically discussed. In this section, the authors mention that they tested the PSADPG algorithm in the **Atari 2600 game environment**, specifically using the tasks **'Acrobot-v1'** and **'Amidar-v0'**. This indicates that these environments serve as datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Atari 2600 game environment**, the citation is:
   > Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. J. Artif. Intell. Res.(JAIR), 47:253â€“279, 2013.

2. The **OpenAI Gym**, which includes the Atari environments, is cited as:
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation to ensure proper attribution.
