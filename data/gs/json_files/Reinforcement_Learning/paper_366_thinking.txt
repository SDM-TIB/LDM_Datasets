To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Neuroevolution: Genetic Algorithms are a Competitive Alternative for Training Deep Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning" by Felipe Petroski Such et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention testing their genetic algorithm on "challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks, including Atari 2600 and Humanoid Locomotion in the MuJoCo simulator." This indicates that there are specific datasets or environments being utilized.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors detail their methodology and the specific datasets used. In **section 4.1 (Atari)**, they describe the use of the **Atari 2600** environment, which is a well-known benchmark for reinforcement learning tasks. They also mention that they are using the **MuJoCo Humanoid-v1 environment** for humanoid locomotion tasks.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Atari 2600**:
   > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

2. **MuJoCo Humanoid-v1**:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
