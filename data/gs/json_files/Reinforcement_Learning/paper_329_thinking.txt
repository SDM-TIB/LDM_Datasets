To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual Learning with Deep Generative Replay" by Hanul Shin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for testing the proposed methods.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention testing their methods on the **MNIST handwritten digit database** and the **Street View House Number (SVHN) dataset**. I will take note of these datasets and look for any additional details provided about them.

In the **experiments subsection 4.1**, the authors describe using the MNIST dataset for sequential learning tasks, which involves classifying permuted inputs. They also mention the SVHN dataset in subsection 4.2, where they evaluate the model's performance on classifying samples from both MNIST and SVHN datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **SVHN dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, volume 2011, page 5, 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with proper references for further exploration.
