To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sample Efficient Actor-Critic with Experience Replay" by Ziyu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the paper evaluates the proposed method on challenging environments, specifically mentioning the **Atari domain** and **continuous control problems**. This indicates that datasets related to these environments may be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **results** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Arcade Learning Environment** for their experiments, which is a key dataset for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.

I will also look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **background** or **methodology** sections. The authors reference several environments, including **MuJoCo** for continuous control tasks, which is another important dataset.

Now, I will check the **results** section for any additional datasets that might be used in the experiments. The authors describe their evaluation on various tasks, including:

1. **Atari Games**: The paper mentions using a collection of 57 Atari games as a benchmark for their method. This is a well-known dataset in reinforcement learning research.

2. **MuJoCo**: The authors also evaluate their method on several continuous control tasks simulated using the MuJoCo physics engine. This includes tasks like **Cartpole**, **Reacher**, **Cheetah**, **Fish**, **Walker**, and **Humanoid**.

After identifying these datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Arcade Learning Environment**, the citation is:
  > M. G. Bellemare, Y. Naddaf, J. Veness, and M. Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. JAIR, 47:253–279, 2013.

- For **MuJoCo**, the citation is:
  > E. Todorov, T. Erez, and Y. Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pp. 5026–5033, 2012.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
