To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Crawling in Rogueâ€™s dungeons with (partitioned) A3C" by Andrea Asperti, Daniele Cortesi, and Francesco Sovrano, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors discuss any prior work or datasets that are relevant to their study. This section often contains background information that can lead to the identification of datasets.

I will then examine the **methods section**, particularly any subsections that discuss the experimental setup or the environment used for training the reinforcement learning agents. This is where datasets are likely to be described in detail.

In this paper, the authors mention a specific environment, "Rogue," which is a classic dungeon-crawling game. However, they do not explicitly mention any external datasets used for training or evaluation. Instead, they describe the environment and the conditions under which the experiments were conducted.

Since the paper does not provide any external datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. This could include datasets used in previous studies that the authors built upon.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors reference their own previous work and other related studies, but they do not cite any specific datasets. The references primarily discuss the algorithms and methodologies rather than datasets.

Given that no explicit datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract for this particular research. However, I will note the importance of the "Rogue" environment as a foundational aspect of their experiments.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring to include any relevant citations from the references section that could be useful for future research or context.

In this case, since no datasets were identified, I will not create any dataset entries but will document the findings regarding the environment used in the study.
