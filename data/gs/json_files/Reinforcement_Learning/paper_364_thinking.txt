To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid CPU/GPU Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic" by Mohammad Babaeizadeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the A3C algorithm and its performance on various gaming tasks, but it does not specify any datasets either. 

I will then look into the **experiments** section, which is typically where datasets are detailed. In this paper, the experiments section is likely to provide information on the environments or datasets used for training and evaluation. I will specifically check for any subsections that might be dedicated to datasets.

Upon reviewing the **experiments** section, I find that the authors mention using the **Atari 2600 environment** for their experiments. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name but rather refer to the environment in general. Since the Atari games are commonly used benchmarks in reinforcement learning, I will note that the dataset consists of various Atari games.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the Atari 2600 environment. The Atari games are often referenced in the context of reinforcement learning, and I will look for the original source that describes the dataset or environment.

The relevant citation for the Atari 2600 environment is:
> Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*, 2016. URL: http://gym.openai.com/

Since the paper does not specify individual datasets for each game, I will summarize the dataset as the Atari 2600 environment, which includes multiple games.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as required. The dataset entry will reflect that it encompasses various Atari games used for reinforcement learning experiments.

In summary, I will document the following dataset:
1. **Atari 2600 Environment**: A collection of various Atari games used for training and evaluation in reinforcement learning tasks.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
