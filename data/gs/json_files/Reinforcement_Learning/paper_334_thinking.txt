To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Energy-efficient Amortized Inference with Cascaded Deep Classifiers" by Jiaqi Guan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and implementation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several image classification datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **implementation section**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, categorized into 10 classes. The images are 32x32 pixels in size.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, but it is divided into 100 classes.

3. **ImageNet32x32**: This is a down-sampled version of the original ImageNet dataset, containing 1.2 million training images and 50,000 test images, with 1,000 classes, but reduced to a resolution of 32x32 pixels.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. 

- For **ImageNet32x32**, the citation is:
  > Chrabaszcz, P., Loshchilov, I., & Hutter, F. (2017). A downsampled variant of imagenet as an alternative to the cifar datasets. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.08819.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
