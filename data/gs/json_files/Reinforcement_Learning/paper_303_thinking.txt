To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stabilizing Transformers for Reinforcement Learning" by Emilio Parisotto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and often mentions key datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss their experiments on the **multi-task DMLab-30 benchmark suite**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors reference the DMLab-30 suite as a benchmark for their experiments, indicating its significance in their research.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors confirm that they conducted experiments on the **DMLab-30** dataset, which is crucial for understanding the context of their findings.

I will also check the **related work and references sections** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The DMLab-30 dataset is cited as follows:
- **DMLab-30**:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified in the paper, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and concise overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
