To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Large-Scale Fleet Management on a Road Network using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning with Graph Neural Network" by Juhyeon Kim and Kihyun Kim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a "realistic simulator that emulates the empirical taxi call data," which suggests that there may be a dataset related to taxi call data.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors state that they trained and evaluated their algorithm using "aggregated and anonymized data in simplified Seoul road network, provided by Kakao Mobility." This indicates that there is a dataset from Kakao Mobility that is crucial for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the following:

1. **Kakao Mobility Data**: This dataset is used for training and testing the proposed model. The citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is important to note that it is sourced from Kakao Mobility.

2. **Speed Data**: The authors mention that the speed data of each road is gathered from a public website. I will need to identify the specific source of this data to provide a complete citation.

Since the paper does not provide detailed citations for the datasets, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Taxi Call Data**: This dataset is used to simulate the ride-hailing service environment. It is aggregated and anonymized data from Kakao Mobility.

- **Speed Data**: This dataset contains speed information for each road, sourced from a public website. I will need to find the exact reference for this data.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations where available, and prepare them for structured output.
