To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Equivalence Between Policy Gradients and Soft Q-Learning" by John Schulman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the exploration of entropy-regularized versions of Q-learning and policy gradients, but it does not specify any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where datasets are most likely to be mentioned. In this section, the authors refer to experiments conducted on the **Atari benchmark**, which suggests that there are specific datasets used for these experiments. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets used in these experiments.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors mention using the **Atari 2600 games** as the benchmark for their experiments. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation for the Atari games themselves. I will need to look at the **References section** to find the appropriate citations for the Atari dataset.

In the **References section**, I will look for any papers or sources that describe the Atari dataset. The Atari games are commonly referenced in reinforcement learning literature, and I expect to find a citation that provides the necessary details.

After reviewing the references, I find the following citation for the Atari dataset:
- For the **Atari 2600 games**, the citation is:
  > Volodymyr Mnih, Koray Kavukcuoglu, David Silver, Andrei A Rusu, Joel Veness, Marc G Bellemare, Alex Graves, Martin Riedmiller, Andreas K Fidjeland, Georg Ostrovski, et al. *Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning*. Nature, 518(7540):529â€“533, 2015.

Now that I have identified the dataset used in the experiments, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Atari 2600 Games**: The paper utilizes the Atari 2600 games as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of the proposed methods.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included, as it is crucial for proper documentation and referencing in future work.
