To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm" by David Silver et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. In this case, the authors discuss the AlphaZero algorithm's performance in chess and shogi, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these games.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors mention that AlphaZero was trained using self-play games, but I need to identify if any specific datasets were referenced for training or evaluation purposes.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors compare AlphaZero's performance against other programs like Stockfish and Elmo. They mention using a database of online chess games (365chess) for analysis, which indicates a dataset that could be relevant.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following:

1. **Online chess games database, 365chess**:
   > Online chess games database, 365chess, 2017. URL: https://www.365chess.com/.

2. **Computer Shogi Association**:
   > Computer Shogi Association. Results of the 27th world computer shogi championship. http://www2.computer-shogi.org/wcsc27/index_e.html. Retrieved November 29th, 2017.

These references indicate that the authors utilized the 365chess database for chess games and the results from the Computer Shogi Association for shogi.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
