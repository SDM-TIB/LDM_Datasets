To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Q-learning from Demonstrations" by Todd Hester et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used in the context of the research. In the abstract, the authors mention leveraging demonstration data to accelerate learning, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **experimental setup section**. This section typically details the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors describe their experiments on the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, which is a collection of Atari games. This indicates that the datasets are likely related to these games.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics across various Atari games, which further confirms that the datasets are derived from the ALE. They mention the number of human demonstrations collected for each game, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

Now, I will compile the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: This is the primary dataset used in the experiments, consisting of various Atari games. The paper does not provide a specific citation for ALE, but it is widely recognized in the field.

2. **Human Demonstration Data**: The authors collected human demonstration data for 42 Atari games, with the number of transitions varying per game. While the paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset, it references the original work that introduced ALE.

Next, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

- For the **human demonstration data**, since it is derived from the gameplay of human players, it does not have a specific citation but is based on the gameplay data collected during the experiments.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have captured all necessary information for future reference or processing.
