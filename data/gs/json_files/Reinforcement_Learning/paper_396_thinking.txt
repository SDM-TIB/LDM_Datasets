To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator" by Alexey Dosovitskiy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces CARLA as a simulator for autonomous driving research, but it does not specify any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are likely to be discussed. In this section, the authors describe the use of CARLA for evaluating different approaches to autonomous driving. They mention that they collected around **14 hours of driving data** for training, which indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

I will also check the **supplementary material** for any additional information about datasets. The paper mentions that the training data consists of driving traces recorded by human drivers and an automated agent. This dataset is referred to as **D = {(oi, ci, ai)}**, where each tuple contains an observation, a command, and an action. However, the paper does not provide a specific name for this dataset.

To ensure I have all relevant information, I will look at the **References section** to see if any external datasets are cited. The authors reference several works, but I need to determine if any of these correspond to datasets used in their experiments.

After reviewing the paper, I find that the primary dataset used for training is the driving traces dataset, but it lacks a formal citation. Therefore, I will document it as follows:

1. **Driving Traces Dataset**: This dataset consists of driving data collected from both human drivers and an automated agent, used for training the imitation learning model. The dataset includes various driving scenarios and commands.

Since there is no formal citation provided for this dataset in the paper, I will note that it is an internal dataset created by the authors during their research.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and any relevant citations where applicable. 

In summary, I will document the following dataset:

- **Driving Traces Dataset**: Internal dataset used for training the imitation learning model, consisting of driving traces recorded by human drivers and an automated agent.

This approach ensures that I have thoroughly extracted and documented the datasets mentioned in the paper, even if some do not have formal citations.
