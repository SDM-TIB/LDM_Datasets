To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Road layout understanding by generative adversarial inpainting" by Lorenzo Berlincioni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **Cityscapes dataset** and a novel dataset generated using the **CARLA simulator**. This suggests that both datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section 3) where the authors discuss their methodology and the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention the **Cityscapes dataset** and introduce a new dataset called the **MICC Semantic Road Inpainting dataset (MICC-SRI)**, which was generated using the CARLA simulator.

In section 3.1, the authors provide details about the **MICC-SRI dataset**, explaining how it was created and its significance for evaluating their inpainting model. They describe the data acquisition process, the number of frames collected, and the characteristics of the dataset, which includes perfectly aligned pairs of semantic maps with and without dynamic objects.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. For the **Cityscapes dataset**, the citation is:
   > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., Schiele, B. (2016). *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 3213â€“3223.

2. For the **MICC Semantic Road Inpainting dataset (MICC-SRI)**, the authors mention that it is available for download at their website, but they do not provide a formal citation in the references. However, I can create a citation based on the information provided in the paper:
   > Berlincioni, L., Becattini, F., Galteri, L., Seidenari, L., Del Bimbo, A. (2023). *MICC Semantic Road Inpainting dataset (MICC-SRI)*. Available at: www.micc.unifi.it/resources/datasets/semantic-road-inpainting/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
