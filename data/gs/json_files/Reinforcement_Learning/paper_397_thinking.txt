To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Policy Update for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Quan Vuong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the methodology and mentions experiments conducted in Mujoco and Atari environments, which suggests that datasets related to these environments may be used.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 6) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they conducted experiments in Mujoco and Atari environments. I will look for specific dataset names or references to datasets within these environments.

In the **Mujoco section**, the authors refer to the Mujoco simulated robotics environments provided by OpenAI Gym. This indicates that the datasets used are likely the standard Mujoco environments, which are widely recognized in the reinforcement learning community.

In the **Atari section**, the authors mention using the Arcade Learning Environments exposed through OpenAI Gym. This suggests that the datasets used are the standard Atari game environments available in this framework.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the Mujoco and Atari environments are as follows:

- For the **Mujoco environments**, the citation is:
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. 2012. URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6386109/

- For the **Atari environments**, the citation is:
  > Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. CoRR, abs/1207.4708, 2012. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4708.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets used in the experiments, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
