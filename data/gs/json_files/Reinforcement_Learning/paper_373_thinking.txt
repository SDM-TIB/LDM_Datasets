To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TreeQN and ATreeC: Differentiable Tree-Structured Models for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Gregory Farquhar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of TreeQN and ATreeC on various tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors describe their evaluation methods. They mention testing on a **box-pushing environment** and a **subset of nine Atari environments**. This indicates that there are datasets related to these environments.

I will then look for specific details about the datasets used in the **box-pushing environment** and the **Atari environments**. The box-pushing environment is described in detail in the appendix (A.1), but it does not reference a specific dataset; rather, it describes a procedurally generated environment. Therefore, I will note that this is a custom environment rather than a publicly available dataset.

For the **Atari environments**, the authors mention using a subset of nine Atari games, specifically referencing the work of Oh et al. (2017) for their evaluation. I will need to identify these nine games to provide a complete dataset entry.

In the **References section**, I will look for the citation for the work by Oh et al. (2017) to ensure I have the correct citation for the Atari datasets. The relevant citation is:
> Junhyuk Oh, Xiaoxiao Guo, Honglak Lee, Richard L Lewis, and Satinder Singh. *Action-conditional video prediction using deep networks in atari games*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2863â€“2871, 2015.

The nine Atari environments mentioned in the paper are:
1. Alien
2. Amidar
3. Crazy Climber
4. Enduro
5. Frostbite
6. Ms. Pacman
7. Q*Bert
8. Seaquest
9. Krull

Now, I will compile the information into structured entries for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

1. **Box-Pushing Environment**: This is a custom environment created for the experiments, so it does not have a formal citation.
2. **Atari Environments**: The datasets used are based on the Atari 2600 games, with the citation provided above.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing.
