To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rainbow: Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Matteo Hessel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experiments show state-of-the-art performance on the **Atari 2600 benchmark**, which indicates that there is a dataset involved, likely related to Atari games.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** or **evaluation methodology** sections. In the **Experimental Methods** section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their agents on **57 Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment**. This is a clear identification of the dataset used for their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The Atari 2600 games dataset is associated with the following citation:

- **Arcade Learning Environment**: 
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the only dataset relevant to the experiments is the **Atari 2600 benchmark**.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the name and citation, into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for the dataset used in the research.
