To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Averaged-DQN: Variance Reduction and Stabilization for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Oron Anschel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)** benchmark for experiments, which suggests that datasets related to this environment may be present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. They mention evaluating the Averaged-DQN algorithm on three Atari games from the ALE: **BREAKOUT**, **SEAQUEST**, and **ASTERIX**. This indicates that these games serve as datasets for their experiments.

I will then look for any specific details about these datasets in the text. The authors provide a brief overview of the games and their significance in the context of reinforcement learning, but they do not provide specific dataset citations within the main text. However, they do reference the original source of the ALE in the introduction and experiments sections.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citation of the Arcade Learning Environment. The relevant citation is:

- **Arcade Learning Environment**:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47:253–279.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets along with their citations:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: A benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms, which includes various Atari games.
   - Citation: Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47:253–279.

2. **BREAKOUT**: An Atari game used as a dataset for evaluating the Averaged-DQN algorithm.
3. **SEAQUEST**: Another Atari game used in the experiments.
4. **ASTERIX**: A third Atari game included in the evaluation.

While the specific games do not have separate citations, they are part of the ALE, which is the authoritative source for these datasets.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately for any downstream processing or review.
