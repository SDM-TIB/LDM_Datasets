To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Reactor: A Fast and Sample-Efficient Actor-Critic Agent for Reinforcement Learning" by Audrūnas Gruslys et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets used in the study.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's objectives and any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method using the **Atari 2600 benchmarks**, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and the benchmarks used for evaluation. They mention that they trained and evaluated the Reactor agent on **57 Atari games from the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**. This is a significant detail as it indicates the use of a specific dataset.

I will then check the **background** and **related work sections** to see if there are any references to the datasets or benchmarks that are commonly used in reinforcement learning research, particularly those related to Atari games.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The Atari 2600 benchmarks are widely recognized in the field, and I will ensure to provide the correct citation for the Arcade Learning Environment.

The citation for the Arcade Learning Environment is:
> Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR), 47:253–279, 2013.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment dataset.

In summary, I will extract the following dataset information:
1. **Dataset Name**: Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)
   - **Description**: A benchmark suite for evaluating general agents on Atari 2600 games.
   - **Citation**: Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR), 47:253–279, 2013.

With this information, I will be ready to present the dataset details in the required format.
