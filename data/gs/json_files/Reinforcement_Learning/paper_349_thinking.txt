To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vulnerability of Deep Reinforcement Learning to Policy Induction Attacks" by Vahid Behzadan and Arslan Munir, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned or utilized in the experiments. The abstract discusses the vulnerability of DQNs to adversarial attacks but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental section (Section 5)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using a game-learning scenario involving the game Pong, which is implemented in Python using the PyGame library. This indicates that the dataset consists of game states and actions derived from the gameplay, but it does not provide a formal dataset name or citation.

I will also check the **References section** to see if there are any references to datasets or related works that might have provided datasets for their experiments. However, the references primarily cite foundational works in reinforcement learning and adversarial examples, rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not provide a formal dataset name or citation, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Game States from Pong**: The dataset consists of game states represented by stacks of 4 consecutive 80x80 gray-scale frames from the Pong game. The authors do not provide a formal citation for this dataset, as it is generated from their experimental setup.

Given that there are no formal datasets with citations provided in the paper, I will note that the dataset is derived from the gameplay of Pong and does not have a specific reference.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format for review or further processing, ensuring to highlight the lack of formal dataset citations.
