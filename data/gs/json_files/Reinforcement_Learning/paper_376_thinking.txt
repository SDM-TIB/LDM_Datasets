To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Explanations Without Opening the Black Box: Automated Decisions and the GDPR" by Sandra Wachter, Brent Mittelstadt, and Chris Russell, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The introduction provides context and may reference datasets used in the research. 

Next, I will focus on **Section III (Generating Counterfactuals)**, where the authors explicitly mention datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they discuss two datasets:

1. **LSAT Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict students' first-year average grades based on various factors, including race and exam scores. The authors mention that a stripped-down version of this dataset is utilized in fairness literature.

2. **Pima Diabetes Database**: This dataset is used to predict whether women of Pima heritage are at risk of diabetes based on several health-related variables.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **LSAT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Darrell Bock & Marcus Lieberman. *Fitting a Response Model for n Dichotomously Scored Items*. Psychometrika, 35(2), 179-196, 1970.

- For the **Pima Diabetes Database**, the citation is:
  > Jack W. Smith et al. *Using the ADAP Learning Algorithm to Forecast the Onset of Diabetes Mellitus*. Proceedings of the Annual Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care, 261-262, 1988.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
