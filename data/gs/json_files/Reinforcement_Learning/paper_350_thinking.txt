To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DARLA: Improving Zero-Shot Transfer in Reinforcement Learning" by Irina Higgins et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the DARLA framework and its application in various reinforcement learning environments, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections where the authors describe the environments used for testing. In this paper, the authors mention two primary environments: **DeepMind Lab** and **MuJoCo**. I will look for specific datasets or environments that are explicitly named or described in relation to these environments.

In the **DeepMind Lab section**, the authors describe a seek-avoid task where the agent interacts with various objects in different room types. They mention that the state space includes all conjunctions of room types and object types, but they do not specify a separate dataset name. Instead, they refer to the environment itself as the dataset.

In the **MuJoCo/Jaco Arm section**, the authors describe using frames from a robotic arm simulation. Again, they do not mention a specific dataset name but refer to the MuJoCo physics engine as the source of their data.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the environments used. The paper cites the following relevant works:

1. **DeepMind Lab**:
   > Beattie, Charles, Leibo, Joel Z., Teplyashin, Denis, Ward, Tom, and et al. *DeepMind Lab*. arXiv, 2016.

2. **MuJoCo**:
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., and Tassa, Y. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. IROS, 2012.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets but rather refers to environments, I will treat these environments as the datasets for the purpose of extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each environment as they serve as the datasets in this context. This will allow for clear documentation of the sources used in the research.
