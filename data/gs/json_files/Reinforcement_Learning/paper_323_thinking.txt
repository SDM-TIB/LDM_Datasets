To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Exploration through Bayesian Deep Q-Networks" by Kamyar Azizzadenesheli and Animashree Anandkumar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of tasks, or domains they cover.

In this paper, the authors mention that they empirically study the behavior of their proposed Bayesian Deep Q-Network (BDQN) on a variety of **Atari games**. This indicates that the datasets are likely related to these games.

I will then check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to capture the original sources for proper citation.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Arcade Learning Environment** for their experiments, I will look for the original paper that describes this environment to provide a complete citation.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations for future reference or analysis.
