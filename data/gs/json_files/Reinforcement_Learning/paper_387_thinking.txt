To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiagent Soft Q-Learning" by Ermo Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation or experimentation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments and may specify which datasets were used to validate their proposed method. I will pay close attention to any details regarding the datasets, such as their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper does not have a clear datasets section, I will search through the **methodology** and **experiments** sections for any references to datasets. I will note any datasets mentioned, including their purpose in the study and any relevant statistics provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset called "Max of Two Quadratics," I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not explicitly cited, I may need to search for the original source of the dataset online or in related literature.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining the integrity of the research and providing clear pathways for others to access the data.
