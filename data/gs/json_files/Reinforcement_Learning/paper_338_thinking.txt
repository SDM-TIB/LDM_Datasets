To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autonomous Braking System via Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Hyunmin Chae et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of an autonomous braking system using deep reinforcement learning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **Section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their simulation setup. They mention using the commercial software **PreScan** for modeling vehicle dynamics in real-time. This indicates that the experiments were conducted using a specific simulation environment rather than a traditional dataset. I will note this as it is relevant to the methodology but not a dataset in the conventional sense.

In the **simulation setup**, the authors provide details about the parameters used in their experiments, such as the initial velocity of the vehicle, the behavior of the pedestrian, and the time-to-collision (TTC) values. However, these parameters do not constitute a dataset that can be cited in the same way as a traditional dataset.

Since there are no traditional datasets mentioned in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any external datasets or benchmarks are cited that could be relevant to the research. However, the references primarily consist of previous works and studies related to reinforcement learning and autonomous driving, rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their experiments. Instead, they relied on simulations created within the PreScan environment. Therefore, I will summarize my findings without specific dataset citations, as there are none to report.

In conclusion, while I have thoroughly searched the paper for datasets, it seems that the authors focused on a simulation-based approach rather than using established datasets. I will document this finding clearly, noting the reliance on PreScan for their experimental setup.
