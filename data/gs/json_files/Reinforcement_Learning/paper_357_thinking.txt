To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Policy Inference Q-Network for Multi-Agent Systems" by Zhang-Wei Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that discuss the experimental setup, as they typically detail the datasets used. I will pay attention to any mentions of specific datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

As I read through the relevant sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned. For instance, if the authors refer to a specific environment or dataset used for training or testing their models, I will record the name and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "OpenAI Gym" or "Atari Games," I will look for the original papers or documentation that describe these datasets and provide their full citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help me create a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are clear and concise, making it easy for others to understand the context and significance of each dataset in relation to the research conducted in the paper.
