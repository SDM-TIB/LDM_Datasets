To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Run with Actor-Critic Ensemble" by Zhewei Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the method and its application, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experiments section** for more detailed information.

In **section 2 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their baseline implementation and the methods used for training and evaluation. They mention using a specific environment for the Learning to Run competition, which implies that there may be a dataset associated with this competition.

Next, I will look for any references to datasets in the **experiments subsection**. The authors refer to the "Learning to Run competition" and provide a link to the competition's leaderboard, which suggests that the competition itself may serve as a dataset or benchmark for their experiments. However, they do not explicitly name a dataset in the text.

To ensure I have all necessary information, I will check the **References section** for any papers that might describe datasets used in the experiments. The references include several papers, but none of them seem to directly describe a dataset related to the Learning to Run competition.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Learning to Run Competition Dataset**: While the paper does not provide a formal citation for a dataset, it references the competition where the experiments were conducted. The competition can be considered a dataset in itself, as it provides the environment and scenarios for training and evaluation.

The citation for the competition can be referenced as:
> Learning to Run Competition. Available at: https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/nips-2017-learning-to-run/leaderboards.

Since there are no additional datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In conclusion, I will create an entry for the Learning to Run competition dataset, ensuring to include the citation for the competition link as it serves as the primary dataset for the experiments described in the paper.
