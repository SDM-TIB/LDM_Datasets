To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-training Neural Networks with Human Demonstrations for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Gabriel V. de la Cruz, Jr., Yunshu Du, and Matthew E. Taylor, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental design sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach using human demonstrations in Atari 2600 games, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental design section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their methodology. They mention using human demonstrations collected from the Atari games **Pong, Freeway, and Beamrider**. This indicates that there are datasets associated with these games.

In **Table 2**, the authors provide a summary of the human demonstration data collected for each game, including the number of frames and performance scores. This table is crucial as it provides specific details about the datasets used in their experiments:

1. **Pong**: 
   - Number of Frames: 11,265
   - Worst Score: -10
   - Best Score: 20

2. **Freeway**: 
   - Number of Frames: 10,241
   - Worst Score: 28
   - Best Score: 31

3. **Beamrider**: 
   - Number of Frames: 11,205
   - Worst Score: 2,160
   - Best Score: 3,406

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. The authors reference the OpenAI Gym, which is used for the Atari environments. The citation for OpenAI Gym is:

- OpenAI Gym: 
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv:arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

Additionally, the authors mention using human demonstrations, which may not have a formal citation but are derived from their own experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. Each dataset will be clearly described, including the number of frames and performance metrics as provided in the paper.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
