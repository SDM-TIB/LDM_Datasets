To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Randomized Value Functions via Multiplicative Normalizing Flows" by Ahmed Touati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it often highlights the evaluation methods, which can lead to dataset identification.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions. For instance, if the authors refer to specific environments or benchmarks, I will note those down.

In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their methods on **two toy domains (N-chain and Mountain Car)** and **several Atari games**. I will take note of these environments as they are likely to be the datasets used for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial as it provides the necessary details for each dataset. For example, if the authors refer to the Arcade Learning Environment, I will find the original citation for that dataset.

Here are the datasets I will extract:

1. **N-chain Environment**: A classic reinforcement learning environment used for testing exploration strategies.
   - Citation: Osband, I., Blundell, C., Pritzel, A., and Van Roy, B. (2016a). *Deep exploration via bootstrapped DQN*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

2. **Mountain Car**: A well-known continuous state task in reinforcement learning.
   - Citation: Moore, A. W. (1990). *Efficient memory-based learning for robot control*.

3. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: A benchmark for evaluating general agents in reinforcement learning.
   - Citation: Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. (2013). *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research.

Next, I will compile these datasets along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use or analysis.
