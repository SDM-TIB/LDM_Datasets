To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Adaptive Clipping Approach for Proximal Policy Optimization" by Gang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed PPO-λ algorithm was empirically tested on several Atari game playing tasks and benchmark control tasks. This indicates that datasets related to these tasks are likely included in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors discuss their empirical analysis in **Section 4 (Empirical Analysis)**, where they compare the performance of PPO-λ and PPO on six benchmark Atari games and four benchmark control tasks. This section is crucial for identifying the specific datasets used.

Upon reviewing Section 4, I find that the authors mention using the **OpenAI Gym** for Atari games and the **PyBullet** robotics environment for control tasks. I will need to extract the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets:

1. **OpenAI Gym**: The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:
   > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv, June 2016.

2. **PyBullet**: The citation for PyBullet is:
   > Coumans, E., & Bai, Y. (2018). Pybullet, a python module for physics simulation for games, robotics and machine learning. http://pybullet.org, 2018.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary information is included for future reference or processing.
