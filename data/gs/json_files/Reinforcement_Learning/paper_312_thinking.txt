To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving NP-Hard Problems on Graphs with Extended AlphaGo Zero" by Kenshin Abe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by scanning the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. In the abstract, the authors discuss experiments conducted on various NP-hard problems, which may imply the use of specific datasets, but I need to look for explicit names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets or data generation methods. In this paper, the authors mention generating Erdős-Rényi (ER) and Barabási-Albert (BA) graphs for testing, which are synthetic datasets.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional datasets or details about the datasets used in the experiments. The authors may provide more context or references to datasets in these sections.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down their descriptions, including the types of graphs generated (e.g., ER and BA graphs) and any specific parameters used (like the number of nodes and edge probabilities).

After gathering the necessary information, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. For example, if the authors reference specific works related to the ER or BA graphs, I will include those citations.

Here are the datasets I will extract:

1. **Erdős-Rényi (ER) Graphs**: The authors mention generating ER graphs with specific parameters (e.g., ER100_15 denotes an ER graph with 100 nodes and edge probability p = 0.15).

2. **Barabási-Albert (BA) Graphs**: Similarly, they describe BA graphs (e.g., BA100_5 denotes a BA graph with 100 nodes and 5 edges added per node).

Next, I will compile the full citations for these datasets based on the references provided in the paper. If the authors do not provide specific citations for these synthetic datasets, I will note that they are commonly used datasets in the literature.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
