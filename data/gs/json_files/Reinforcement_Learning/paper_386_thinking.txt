To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Count-Based Exploration with Neural Density Models" by Georg Ostrovski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of a density model for exploration in reinforcement learning, which may imply the use of specific datasets, particularly in the context of Atari games.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics. In this paper, the authors refer to the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, which is a framework that includes various Atari 2600 games.

In the **background section**, the authors mention the use of the Atari 2600 games as a benchmark for their experiments. I will note that the paper evaluates their method on several Atari games, which are part of the ALE.

I will then check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any specific details about the datasets used, such as the number of games or specific game titles. The paper mentions several Atari games, including **Montezuma's Revenge**, **Gravitar**, and **Private Eye**, which are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The Atari games are part of the ALE, and the relevant citation for this framework is:

- For the Arcade Learning Environment:
  > Bellemare, Marc G., Veness, Joel, and Talvitie, Erik. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253–279, 2013.

Additionally, I will note the specific games mentioned in the paper, such as:
- **Montezuma's Revenge**: 
  > Bellemare, Marc G., Srinivasan, Sriram, Ostrovski, Georg, Schaul, Tom, Saxton, David, and Munos, Rémi. *Unifying Count-Based Exploration and Intrinsic Motivation*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2016.

- **Gravitar** and **Private Eye** are also part of the Atari games evaluated, but they do not have separate citations as they are included in the ALE framework.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
