To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Addressing Function Approximation Error in Actor-Critic Methods" by Scott Fujimoto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on the **suite of OpenAI gym tasks**, which indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to identify the specific datasets used.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 6) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention that they evaluate their algorithm on **seven continuous control domains from OpenAI gym**. I will list these domains as datasets.

The specific environments mentioned in the paper are:
1. **HalfCheetah-v1**
2. **Hopper-v1**
3. **Walker2d-v1**
4. **Ant-v1**
5. **Reacher-v1**
6. **InvertedPendulum-v1**
7. **InvertedDoublePendulum-v1**

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. Since these environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, I will reference the original OpenAI Gym paper for the datasets:

- For the OpenAI Gym, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:
1. **HalfCheetah-v1**
2. **Hopper-v1**
3. **Walker2d-v1**
4. **Ant-v1**
5. **Reacher-v1**
6. **InvertedPendulum-v1**
7. **InvertedDoublePendulum-v1**

And the full citation for the OpenAI Gym, which encompasses these datasets, is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

With this information, I am ready to proceed with the next steps in processing or presenting the dataset information as needed.
