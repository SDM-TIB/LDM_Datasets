To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Addressing Some Limitations of Transformers with Feedback Memory" by Angela Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may hint at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples or tasks they are used for.

In **section 4.1**, the authors discuss various tasks and their performance, which may include references to datasets. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that summarize results, as they often include dataset names.

If the datasets are not explicitly named in the experiments section, I will check the **related work** and **methodology sections** for any references to datasets that might have been used in previous studies or benchmarks.

Once I identify the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **WMT14 dataset** for machine translation tasks, I will look for the citation in the references, which might be something like:
> "Myle Ott, Sergey Edunov, David Grangier, and Michael Auli. *Scaling Neural Machine Translation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.00187, 2018."

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, purpose, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete for future use or analysis.
