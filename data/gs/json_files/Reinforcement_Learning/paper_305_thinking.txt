To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer-Based Acoustic Modeling for Hybrid Speech Recognition" by Yongqiang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed transformer-based acoustic model is evaluated on the **Librispeech benchmark**. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they specifically mention the **Librispeech corpus** as the primary dataset for evaluation. The paper states that this corpus contains about 960 hours of read speech data, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Librispeech corpus**. The citation provided in the references is:
> V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of ICASSP, 2015, pp. 5206â€“5210.

Additionally, the authors mention conducting experiments on a **much larger internal dataset** for English video ASR, but they do not provide a specific name or citation for this dataset. Since it is an internal dataset, it may not have a formal citation available.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **Librispeech corpus**. The internal dataset will be noted as an internal dataset without a formal citation.

In summary, I have identified the following datasets from the paper:

1. **Librispeech corpus**: A widely used dataset for automatic speech recognition, containing approximately 960 hours of read speech data.

2. **Internal dataset**: A large-scale dataset used for English video ASR, but no formal citation is available.

I will now prepare the dataset entries for further processing.
