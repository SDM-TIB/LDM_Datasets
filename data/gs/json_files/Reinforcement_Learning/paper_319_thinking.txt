To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Prioritized Experience Replay" by Dan Horgan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the architecture improves performance on the **Arcade Learning Environment**, which suggests that this is a dataset used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their evaluations on the **Atari games** and **continuous control tasks**. They specifically mention using the **Arcade Learning Environment** as a benchmark for their experiments. This indicates that the Atari games serve as a dataset for their evaluations.

I will also check the **background and methodology sections** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or referenced. The paper discusses the use of the **DeepMind Control Suite** for continuous control tasks, which is another dataset relevant to their experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment**: This dataset is referenced in the context of evaluating the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms. The citation for the original paper describing the Arcade Learning Environment is:
   > Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR), 47:253â€“279, 2013.

2. **DeepMind Control Suite**: This suite is mentioned as a benchmark for continuous control tasks. The citation for this suite is:
   > Yuval Tassa, Yotam Doron, Alistair Muldal, Tom Erez, Yazhe Li, Diego de Las Casas, David Budden, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Josh Merel, Andrew Lefrancq, Timothy Lillicrap, and Martin Riedmiller. *DeepMind Control Suite*, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations, ready for further processing or review.
