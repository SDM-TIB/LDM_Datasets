To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Formulation of Deep Reinforcement Learning Architecture Toward Autonomous Driving for On-Ramp Merge" by Pin Wang and Ching-Yao Chan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and implementation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of autonomous driving but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their approach to using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for the on-ramp merge problem. Here, they mention that they use real-world driving data obtained from cameras placed on a high pole to record merging scenarios. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more details.

In the **implementation section**, the authors elaborate on how they collect data for training their LSTM model. They state that video analysis is performed to obtain observation and action variables from the recorded merging scenarios. However, they do not provide a specific name for the dataset or a formal citation.

Since the paper does not explicitly name a dataset or provide a citation, I will note that the dataset is derived from real-world driving data collected through video analysis. I will also mention that the authors do not provide a formal citation for this dataset in the references.

Finally, I will summarize my findings regarding the dataset:

1. **Real-World Driving Data**: The dataset consists of driving scenarios recorded via cameras to analyze on-ramp merging behavior. However, no formal citation is provided in the paper.

Since the authors did not provide a specific dataset name or citation, I will document this finding clearly, indicating that while the dataset is crucial for their methodology, it lacks formal acknowledgment in the references.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
