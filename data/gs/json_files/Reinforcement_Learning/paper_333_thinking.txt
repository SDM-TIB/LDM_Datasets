To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classifying Options for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Kai Arulkumaran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets or benchmarks that the authors might have used to validate their approach. The introduction discusses the deep Q-network (DQN) and its applications but does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section is crucial as it typically details the methodologies and datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors describe their experiments using the game "Catch," which is a specific environment rather than a traditional dataset. However, I need to check if they reference any datasets or environments that are commonly used in reinforcement learning.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors mention using the game "Catch" as their experimental setup. They describe the input as a greyscale 24x24 pixel grid and the action space consisting of three discrete actions. However, they do not cite any external datasets or benchmarks, as the game environment is self-contained.

Since there are no external datasets mentioned in the paper, I will now check the **References section** to see if any datasets are indirectly referenced through the works cited. The references primarily include foundational papers on reinforcement learning and DQNs, but they do not provide specific datasets.

In conclusion, this paper does not utilize any external datasets that require citation. The primary focus is on the experimental setup of the "Catch" game, which is a simulation rather than a dataset. Therefore, I will note that there are no datasets to extract from this paper, and I will document this finding accordingly.

Overall, my process involved:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identifying that the experiments were conducted in a self-contained game environment ("Catch").
3. Checking the references for any indirect dataset mentions, which yielded no results.

Since no datasets were found, I will summarize my findings without creating any dataset entries.
