To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Inference for Policy Gradient" by Tianbing Xu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section closely. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, and it may reference datasets indirectly. However, it appears that this section also does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then move on to the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this paper, there are no explicit sections labeled as "Datasets," but I will look for any mentions of datasets within the methodology or experiments.

As I read through the paper, I will pay attention to any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the paper discusses experiments involving specific datasets, I will note those down.

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets.

If I find any datasets, I will ensure to write down their full citations. For example, if the paper references a dataset like the "OpenAI Gym" for reinforcement learning, I would look for the citation in the references, which might look something like this:

- OpenAI. *OpenAI Gym*. 2016. Available at: https://gym.openai.com/

If no datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, if any exist.
