To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Brandom-ian view of Reinforcement Learning towards strong-AI" by Atrisha Sarkar, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the focus is primarily on the philosophical aspects of Brandom's work and its implications for reinforcement learning, without any mention of specific datasets. I will continue to the **methodology and experiments sections** to check for any datasets used in the research.

As I progress through the paper, I will pay close attention to sections that discuss experiments or implementations, as these are likely to contain references to datasets. However, upon reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the author does not reference any specific datasets used for empirical validation or experimentation. Instead, the paper focuses on theoretical discussions and philosophical implications of reinforcement learning in the context of Brandom's philosophy.

Since no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of others. However, the references primarily consist of philosophical texts and foundational papers in reinforcement learning, rather than datasets.

Given that there are no datasets to extract from this paper, I will conclude that there are no dataset entries to create. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have followed the steps of identifying the dataset names, descriptions, and then locating their full citations in the references.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in this paper, and therefore, no dataset entries will be created.
