To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3DCNN-DQN-RNN: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Semantic Parsing of Large-scale 3D Point Clouds" by Fangyu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of semantic parsing of 3D point clouds and mention the need for effective datasets. However, I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention two datasets:

1. **Stanford 3D Semantic Parsing Dataset**: This dataset contains 3D scans from Matterport scanners across 6 areas, fully annotated for 12 semantic classes. The authors specify that they randomly choose 70% of the rooms for training and the remaining for testing.

2. **SUNCG Dataset**: This dataset includes 45,622 house models and is annotated for 84 classes. The authors convert this data into 3D point clouds for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Stanford 3D Semantic Parsing Dataset**, the citation is:
  > I. Armeni, O. Sener, A. R. Zamir, H. Jiang, I. Brilakis, M. Fischer, and S. Savarese. *3D Semantic Parsing of Large-Scale Indoor Spaces*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016.

- For the **SUNCG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Song, F. Yu, A. Zeng, A. X. Chang, M. Savva, and T. Funkhouser. *Semantic Scene Completion from a Single Depth Image*. In Proceedings of the 30th IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
