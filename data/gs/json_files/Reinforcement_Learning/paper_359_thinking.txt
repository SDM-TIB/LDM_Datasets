To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting Noise Robustness of Acoustic Model via Deep Adversarial Training" by Bin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section (Section 5)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They describe two types of data:

1. **Real Data**: This dataset consists of recordings made in real noisy environments, specifically on a bus, in a cafe, in a pedestrian area, and at a street junction. The authors note that this dataset includes 1,600 utterances.

2. **Simulated Data**: This dataset is generated by artificially mixing clean speech data from the WSJ0 set with noisy backgrounds. The training set for this dataset contains 7,138 utterances.

The authors also mention that the development and test sets consist of 3,280 and 2,640 utterances, respectively, with equal quantities of real and simulated data.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The WSJ0 dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of speech recognition, and its citation is:

- For the **WSJ0 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Paul, L. and Baker, J. *The Wall Street Journal Speech Corpus for Research and Development*. Linguistic Data Consortium, 1992.

Since the real data is collected from specific environments, it may not have a formal citation, but I will note that it is based on recordings made in various real-world settings.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the WSJ0 dataset and provide a clear description of both datasets used in the experiments.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
