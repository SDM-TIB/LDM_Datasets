To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Surprising Negative Results for Generative Adversarial Tree Search" by Kamyar Azizzadenesheli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of **Atari environments** for testing their method, which suggests that there may be specific datasets or environments referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or environments, particularly in subsection 4.1, where they might detail the specific Atari games they used for evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)** as their testbed for the experiments. This is a crucial piece of information, as ALE is a well-known framework for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment. The citation is as follows:
> Machado, M. C., Bellemare, M. G., Talvitie, E., Veness, J., Hausknecht, M., and Bowling, M. (2017). *Revisiting the arcade learning environment: Evaluation protocols and open problems for general agents*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.06009.

Additionally, I will note that the authors conducted experiments on several specific Atari games, including **Pong, Asterix, Breakout, Crazy Climber, and Freeway**. However, since these are part of the ALE framework, I will primarily focus on the ALE citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment, as it serves as the primary dataset used in the experiments.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are structured correctly and ready for any further processing or review.
