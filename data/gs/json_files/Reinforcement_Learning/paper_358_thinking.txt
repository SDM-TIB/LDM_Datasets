To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimized Computation Offloading Performance in Virtual Edge Computing Systems via Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Xianfu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will focus on that to gather detailed information about each dataset. This section often contains descriptions of the datasets, including their sources, the types of data they contain, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Mobile Edge Computing Dataset," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is not explicitly cited, I will note the details provided in the text and search for the original source if necessary.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
