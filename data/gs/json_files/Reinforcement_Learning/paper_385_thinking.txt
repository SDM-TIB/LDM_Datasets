To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weighted Double Deep Multiagent Reinforcement Learning in Stochastic Cooperative Environments" by Yan Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used in experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that discuss the methodology or experimental setup, as these sections typically detail the datasets used for evaluation. 

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data). If the authors provide specific details about how the datasets were used in their experiments, I will document that as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the datasets for their own research. I will ensure that I capture all necessary details for each citation, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "OpenAI Gym," I would look for the original source or paper that describes this dataset and note its full citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their descriptions and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Identify and extract details from the datasets or experiments section.
3. Document the names, descriptions, and statistics of the datasets.
4. Retrieve full citations from the References section.
5. Compile the information for clarity and future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper citations.
