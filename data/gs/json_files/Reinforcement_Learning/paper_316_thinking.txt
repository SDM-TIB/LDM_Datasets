To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Explore with Meta-Policy Gradient" by Tianbing Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically details the methodologies and datasets used for evaluation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on several classic control tasks, including **Hopper, Reacher, Half-Cheetah, Inverted Pendulum, Inverted Double Pendulum, and Pendulum**. I will note these tasks as they likely correspond to specific datasets or environments used in the experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned. The paper references the OpenAI DDPG baseline (Plappert et al., 2017), which is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets used. 

The relevant citations I need to extract are:

- For the DDPG baseline:
  > Plappert, Matthias, Houthooft, Rein, Dhariwal, Prafulla, and et al. *Parameter space noise for exploration*. arXiv, 2017. URL https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.01905.pdf.

Additionally, I will look for any other specific datasets or environments that might be cited in the references, particularly those related to the classic control tasks mentioned earlier.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
