To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rapid Probabilistic Interest Learning from Domain-Specific Pairwise Image Comparisons" by Michael Burke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the datasets section** (Section V) to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the datasets section will contain specific details about the datasets used in the experiments.

In **Section V (Datasets)**, the authors describe five distinct datasets used for testing their proposed approach. I will carefully note the name of each dataset, its description, and any relevant details provided.

1. **OASIS**: This dataset consists of 416 averaged and co-registered T1-weighted MRI scans of patients with varying levels of dementia. The authors mention that pairwise comparison results were simulated based on normalised brain volume measurements.

2. **Violence**: This dataset includes over 10,000 protest images with accompanying measures of perceived violence. The authors explain how they generated pairwise comparison outcomes based on these perceived violence scores.

3. **CSIR**: This dataset comprises 4,000 outdoor images captured by an autonomous rover in an uncontrolled environment. The authors describe how baseline pairwise image comparison results were obtained through a labeling interface.

4. **Coastcam**: This dataset consists of nearly 2,000 outdoor images of the Fishhoek coastline in South Africa. The authors detail how pairwise comparisons were generated by presenting images to a domain expert.

5. **Place Pulse 2.0**: This dataset includes 110,988 Google Streetview images taken from 56 cities. The authors mention that over 1 million baseline pairwise image comparisons were captured for various perceptual attributes, focusing on the safety attribute in their work.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
