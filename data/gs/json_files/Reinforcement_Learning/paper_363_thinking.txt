To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Teaching a Machine to Read Maps with Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Gino Brunner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Environment and Results)**, where the authors describe the training and test sets of mazes. They mention that they created a training set consisting of 100 mazes of different sizes (5x5, 7x7, 9x9, 11x11, and 13x13) and a test set of 900 mazes (100 in each of the sizes 5x5, 7x7, 9x9, 11x11, 13x13, 15x15, 17x17, 19x19, and 21x21). This indicates that the mazes themselves are the datasets used for training and evaluation.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets. However, since the mazes are generated by the authors and do not correspond to an external dataset, I will note that the mazes are original creations for the purpose of this research.

The relevant datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Training Set of Mazes**: This dataset consists of 100 mazes of varying sizes (5x5, 7x7, 9x9, 11x11, and 13x13). The mazes are designed to train the reinforcement learning agent to navigate and localize itself.

2. **Test Set of Mazes**: This dataset includes 900 mazes, with 100 mazes for each size (5x5, 7x7, 9x9, 11x11, 13x13, 15x15, 17x17, 19x19, and 21x21). These mazes are used to evaluate the performance of the trained agent.

Since these datasets are not sourced from external references, I will not provide traditional citations but will describe them as original datasets created for the study.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that clearly outlines the details of each dataset, ensuring that the information is accurate and complete for future reference or processing.
