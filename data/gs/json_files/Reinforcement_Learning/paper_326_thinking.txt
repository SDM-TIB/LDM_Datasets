To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural Gradient Deep Q-learning" by Ethan Knight and Osher Lerner, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 6), where the authors typically describe the environments used for testing their algorithm. In this section, the authors mention that they tested their NGDQN algorithm on four classic control environments from OpenAI Gym: **CartPole-v0, CartPole-v1, Acrobot-v1, and LunarLander-v2**. This indicates that these environments serve as datasets for their experiments.

I will then look for a **dedicated section or appendix** that provides more details about these environments. In this case, the paper includes an **Appendix B** that describes each environment in detail, including their objectives and how they are structured. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets used.

The descriptions of the datasets are as follows:

1. **CartPole-v0**: A classic control task where the agent balances a pole on a sliding cart for 200 timesteps. The agent receives rewards based on the pole's angle and cart position.

2. **CartPole-v1**: Similar to CartPole-v0, but the agent must balance the pole for 500 timesteps instead of 200. The performance metric is the average reward over 100 episodes.

3. **Acrobot-v1**: In this environment, the agent swings a double-jointed pendulum up from a stationary position. The agent receives rewards for successfully swinging the pendulum.

4. **LunarLander-v2**: The agent attempts to land a lander on a specific location in a simulated 2D world. The agent receives rewards for landing successfully and loses points for crashing or using fuel.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any foundational papers or datasets mentioned. However, since these environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, I will note that they are publicly available and can be cited as follows:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. ArXiv e-prints, abs/1606.01540, 2016. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
