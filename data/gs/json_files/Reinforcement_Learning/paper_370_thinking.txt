To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sample-Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning via Episodic Backward Update" by Su Young Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method's performance on **49 games of the Atari 2600 domain**. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention using the **Arcade Learning Environment** as a benchmark for their experiments. This is a strong indication that the Atari 2600 games dataset is a key component of their evaluation.

I will also look for any specific mentions of datasets in the **background or related work sections**. The authors reference the **Atari 2600 domain** and the **2D MNIST Maze Environment** as environments in which they tested their algorithm. This suggests that both of these environments are datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Atari 2600 domain**, the citation is:
   > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. "The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents." *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47:253-279, 2013.

2. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., and Haffner, P. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." *Proceedings of the IEEE*, 86(11):2278-2324, 1998.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
