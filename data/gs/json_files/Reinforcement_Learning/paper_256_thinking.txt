To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AlphaStar: An Evolutionary Computation Perspective" by Kai Arulkumaran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets or benchmarks. The abstract discusses AlphaStar's capabilities but does not explicitly mention datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **background and components sections** for any references to datasets used in the development or evaluation of AlphaStar. The paper discusses various AI concepts and methodologies but does not seem to specify any datasets directly.

Since the paper focuses on the theoretical aspects of AlphaStar and its evolutionary computation perspective, I will check the **references section** for any cited datasets or related works that might include datasets. 

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for training or evaluation in the context of AlphaStar. However, it references other works that may have utilized datasets in their methodologies, such as the work by Jaderberg et al. (2018) on population-based training, which could imply the use of datasets in their experiments.

To summarize, I will note that while the paper discusses the AlphaStar system and its training methodologies, it does not provide specific datasets or their citations. Therefore, I will not be able to extract any datasets from this paper as it lacks explicit mentions of them.

In conclusion, I will document my findings, noting that no datasets were identified in the paper "AlphaStar: An Evolutionary Computation Perspective" by Kai Arulkumaran et al., and thus no citations can be provided.
