To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parameter Space Noise for Exploration" by Matthias Plappert et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the types of experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets or experimental setups.

In **Section 4.1**, the authors discuss their experimental comparisons and mention using the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)** as a benchmark for discrete action environments. They also refer to various environments from OpenAI Gym and rllab, which are crucial for understanding the datasets used in their experiments.

I will compile a list of the specific environments mentioned:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: This is a widely used benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms. The authors indicate that they used 21 games from this environment, which is significant for their experiments.

2. **OpenAI Gym Environments**: The paper lists several environments used for continuous control tasks, including:
   - HalfCheetah
   - Hopper
   - InvertedDoublePendulum
   - InvertedPendulum
   - Reacher
   - Swimmer
   - Walker2D

3. **Sparse Reward Environments from rllab**: The authors also mention using modified environments for sparse rewards, including:
   - SparseCartpoleSwingup
   - SparseHalfCheetah
   - SparseMountainCar
   - SparseDoublePendulum
   - SwimmerGather

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The paper may not provide formal citations for the environments since they are well-known benchmarks, but I will note the original papers or sources for these environments:

- For **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, the citation is:
  > Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253–279, 2013. doi: 10.1613/jair.3912.

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

- For the environments from **rllab**, the citation is:
  > Yan Duan, Xi Chen, Rein Houthooft, John Schulman, and Pieter Abbeel. *Benchmarking Deep Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control*. In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pp. 1329–1338, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented each dataset and its corresponding citation. This will allow me to create a structured output that includes all relevant datasets and their citations for further use or analysis.
