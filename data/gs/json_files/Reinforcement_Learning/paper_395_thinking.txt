To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging the Gap Between Value and Policy Based Reinforcement Learning" by Ofir Nachum et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and prior work, which may include datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay special attention to it, as it is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will note down the names of the datasets, their purposes, and any relevant statistics or features mentioned by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "OpenAI Gym," I would look for the citation that corresponds to it, which might be something like:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). OpenAI Gym. arXiv:1606.01540.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, making it easier for others to understand and utilize the findings of the study.
