To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks" by Chelsea Finn et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the problem context and may reference specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly sections that detail the methodology and results. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

In the paper, the authors mention two specific datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Omniglot Dataset**: This dataset consists of 20 instances of 1623 characters from 50 different alphabets, which is commonly used for few-shot learning tasks.

2. **MiniImagenet Dataset**: This dataset is a benchmark for few-shot learning, consisting of 64 training classes, 12 validation classes, and 24 test classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Omniglot Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lake, Brenden M., Salakhutdinov, Ruslan, Gross, Jason, and Tenenbaum, Joshua B. *One shot learning of simple visual concepts*. In Conference of the Cognitive Science Society (CogSci), 2011.

- For the **MiniImagenet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ravi, Sachin, and Larochelle, Hugo. *Optimization as a model for few-shot learning*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
