To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Factor Policies and Action-Value Functions: Factored Action Space Representations for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Sahil Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses improvements in DRL methods and mentions the Atari 2600 domain, which suggests that datasets related to Atari games may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors detail their methodology and results. In section 4.2, they mention training FARA3C networks on **14 tasks in the Atari domain**. This indicates that the Atari 2600 games serve as the datasets for their experiments.

I will look for specific names of the games used in the experiments. In the tables provided (Table 1 and Table 2), the authors list the performance of FARA3C and A3C on various Atari games, including:

1. **Alien**
2. **Bank Heist**
3. **Boxing**
4. **Frostbite**
5. **Gravitar**
6. **Hero**
7. **James Bond**
8. **Krull**
9. **Roadrunner**
10. **Seaquest**
11. **Solaris**
12. **Space Invaders**
13. **Star Gunner**
14. **Zaxxon**

These games are part of the Atari 2600 dataset, which is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning research.

Now, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the Atari 2600 dataset. The Atari 2600 dataset is commonly referenced in the literature, and the relevant citation is:

- For the **Atari 2600 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, Marc G., Naddaf, Yavar, Veness, Joel, and Bowling, Michael. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, pp. 253â€“279, June 2013.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The Atari 2600 games serve as the primary dataset for the experiments conducted by the authors.
