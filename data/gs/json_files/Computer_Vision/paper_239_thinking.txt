To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Localization: A Missing Link in the Pipeline of Object Matching and Registration" by Deepak Mishra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that initial experiments were conducted on **MNIST** and **Caltech-101** datasets, which suggests that these datasets are important for the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors describe it as a dataset of handwritten digits, with each image sized 28×28 pixels. They mention that the dataset is suitable for matching due to the variability in writing styles.

2. **Caltech-101 Dataset**: This dataset contains images from 101 categories, with specific conditions regarding the coverage of objects in the images. The authors explain how they utilized images from different sets for their experiments.

3. **Ultrasound-CT Dataset**: This is a synthetic dataset developed for medical image registration, created by simulating ultrasound images from CT images. The authors reference a previous work for the simulation process.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

- For the **Caltech-101 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > L. Fei-Fei, R. Fergus, and P. Perona. *One-Shot Learning of Object Categories*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 28(4):594–611, 2006.

- For the **Ultrasound-CT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J.-L. Dillenseger, S. Laguitton, and É. Delabrousse. *Fast Simulation of Ultrasound Images from a CT Volume*. Computers in Biology and Medicine, 39(2):180–186, 2009.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
