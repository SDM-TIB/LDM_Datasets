To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AlphaStar: An Evolutionary Computation Perspective" by Kai Arulkumaran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors discuss AlphaStar's training methods, including population-based training (PBT) and competitive co-evolution, but I need to confirm if they reference any specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations that might indicate datasets. The paper discusses various concepts and algorithms but does not explicitly mention datasets in the main text. However, it references other works that may have utilized datasets relevant to the research.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will compile the information I find. If no specific datasets are mentioned, I will note that as well. If I find any datasets, I will ensure to extract their full citations from the references section.

For example, if the paper had mentioned a dataset like "StarCraft II" for training AlphaStar, I would look for the appropriate citation in the references. In this case, I would find the citation for the original AlphaStar paper by Oriol Vinyals et al. that discusses the game and its relevance to the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly. This will ensure that the extracted information is comprehensive and properly attributed.
