To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Semantic Role Labeling with Cross-View Training" by Rui Cai and Mirella Lapata, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their model on the **CoNLL-2009 benchmark dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely to be one of the primary datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. Here, the authors state that they evaluated their model on the **CoNLL-2009 benchmark datasets** for English, Chinese, German, and Spanish. This confirms that the CoNLL-2009 dataset is indeed central to their research.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. In the experiments section, the authors refer to using the **1 Billion Word Language Model Benchmark** for English, the **Sougou News Data** for Chinese, the **NEGRA corpus** for German, and the **Spanish Language News Corpus** for Spanish. This indicates that these datasets are also utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each of these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

After compiling this information, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper references for future use or verification.
