To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rotated Word Vector Representations and their Interpretability" by Sungjoon Park, JinYeong Bak, and Alice Oh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of rotation algorithms to word vector representations, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training their word vector models. They mention using the **Wikipedia English articles** as the training corpus, which contains 5.3 million articles, 83 million sentences, and 1.676 billion tokens. This is a significant dataset for their experiments.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the **evaluation sections**. In **section 5 (Expressive Performance)**, the authors refer to several benchmark tasks and datasets used for evaluation, including:

1. **SimLex-999**: A dataset for evaluating the similarity of word pairs.
2. **TREC dataset**: Used for question classification.
3. **20 Newsgroups dataset**: Used for topic classification.
4. **Movie reviews dataset**: Used for sentiment analysis.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

- For **Wikipedia English articles**, there is no specific citation provided, but it is commonly known and can be referenced as:
  > Wikipedia contributors. *Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia*. Available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page

- For **SimLex-999**, the citation is:
  > Hill, M., Reichart, R., & Korhonen, A. (2016). Simlex-999: Evaluating semantic models with (genuine) similarity estimation. *Computational Linguistics*.

- For the **TREC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Faruqui, M., Tsvetkov, Y., Yogatama, D., Dyer, C., & Smith, N. (2015). Sparse overcomplete word vector representations. In *Proceedings of ACL*.

- For the **20 Newsgroups dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yogatama, D., & Smith, N. A. (2014). Linguistic structured sparsity in text categorization. In *Proceedings of ACL*.

- For the **Movie reviews dataset**, the citation is:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J. Y., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2013). Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank. In *Proceedings of EMNLP*.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their proper citations from the research paper.
