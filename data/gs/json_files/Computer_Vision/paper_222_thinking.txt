To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Patch Matching Using Convolutional Descriptors with Euclidean Distance" by Iaroslav Melekhov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention that they propose a neural network-based image descriptor and that they conducted experiments using a specific dataset. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the importance of finding correspondences between image regions and mention the **Multi-view Stereo Correspondence (MSC) dataset**. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

In **section 3 (Neural Descriptor)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the MSC dataset, stating that it consists of more than 1.5 million grayscale patches and includes pairs of matching and non-matching patches extracted from images of the Statue of Liberty, Notredame, and Half Dome (Yosemite). This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors mention any additional datasets or provide further details about the MSC dataset's use. They confirm that they utilize the MSC dataset for training and evaluation, which reinforces its significance.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the MSC dataset. The authors reference the original paper that introduced the MSC dataset, which is crucial for proper citation.

The citation for the MSC dataset is:
> Hua, G., Brown, M., Winder, S. "Discriminant learning of local image descriptors." In: Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on. (2010).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. The MSC dataset is the primary dataset mentioned in the paper, and I will document it accordingly.

In summary, I will extract the following dataset information:
1. **Dataset Name**: Multi-view Stereo Correspondence (MSC) dataset
2. **Description**: A dataset consisting of more than 1.5 million grayscale patches, including pairs of matching and non-matching patches extracted from images of the Statue of Liberty, Notredame, and Half Dome (Yosemite).
3. **Full Citation**: Hua, G., Brown, M., Winder, S. "Discriminant learning of local image descriptors." In: Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on. (2010).

With this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately capture the dataset information from the research paper.
