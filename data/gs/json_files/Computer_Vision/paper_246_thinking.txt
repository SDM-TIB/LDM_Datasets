To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning Techniques for Humor Detection in Hindi-English Code-Mixed Tweets" by Sushmitha Reddy Sane et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose methods for humor detection using bilingual word embeddings and deep learning architectures, which suggests that they may have used specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any datasets or prior works that utilized datasets. In this section, they discuss the challenges of humor detection in code-mixed data and reference previous research, but I need to find specific datasets.

In the **results section**, the authors mention using a benchmark dataset published by Khandelwal et al. (2018) for evaluating their models. They specify that this dataset contains 3543 annotated tweets, with 1755 labeled as humorous and 1698 as non-humorous. This is a clear indication of a dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the benchmark dataset:
  > Ankush Khandelwal, Sahil Swami, Syed S Akhtar, and Manish Shrivastava. *Humor detection in English-Hindi code-mixed social media content: Corpus and baseline system*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.05513, 2018.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about it.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant information for downstream processing.
