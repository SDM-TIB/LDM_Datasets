To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Spatial Transformer Network" by Chang Shu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments on "cluttered MNIST handwritten digits classification" and "image plane alignment," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **subsection 4.1 (Cluttered MNIST Classification)**, they explicitly mention using the "cluttered MNIST handwriting digits database," which is a modified version of the classical MNIST dataset. This indicates that the MNIST dataset is a key dataset used in their experiments.

In **subsection 4.2 (Planar Face Alignment)**, the authors refer to a "human face database published by [Peng et al., 2012]." This suggests that another dataset is being utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **cluttered MNIST handwriting digits database**, the citation is:
   > Yann Lecun and Corinna Cortes. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. 2010.

2. For the **human face database**, the citation is:
   > Yigang Peng, Arvind Ganesh, John Wright, Wenli Xu, and Yi Ma. *Rasl: Robust alignment by sparse and low-rank decomposition for linearly correlated images*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 34(11):2233â€“2246, 2012.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details for future reference or processing.
