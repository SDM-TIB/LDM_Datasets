To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FASPell: A Fast, Adaptable, Simple, Powerful Chinese Spell Checker Based On DAE-Decoder Paradigm" by Yuzhong Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions of the paper, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments and results)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Data, metrics and configurations)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention several benchmark datasets for Chinese spelling checking, specifically:

1. **T rn13**: This dataset contains 350 erroneous sentences out of a total of 3575 sentences, with an average length of 41.8 characters.
2. **T rn14**: This dataset contains 3432 erroneous sentences out of 3435 sentences, with an average length of 49.6 characters.
3. **T rn15**: This dataset contains 2339 erroneous sentences out of 2339 sentences, with an average length of 31.3 characters.
4. **T st13**: This dataset contains 996 erroneous sentences out of 1000 sentences, with an average length of 74.3 characters.
5. **T st14**: This dataset contains 529 erroneous sentences out of 1000 sentences, with an average length of 50.0 characters.
6. **T st15**: This dataset contains 550 erroneous sentences out of 1100 sentences, with an average length of 30.6 characters.
7. **T rnocr**: This dataset contains 4575 sentences harvested from OCR results, with 4516 being simplified Chinese.
8. **T stocr**: This dataset is also harvested from OCR results, but specific details are not provided in the text.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, the datasets mentioned (T rn13, T rn14, T rn15, T st13, T st14, T st15, T rnocr, T stocr) are likely derived from shared tasks or benchmarks in the field of Chinese language processing, and may not have formal citations like traditional datasets.

To summarize the datasets extracted:
- **T rn13**: 350 erroneous sentences, 3575 total sentences, average length 41.8 characters.
- **T rn14**: 3432 erroneous sentences, 3435 total sentences, average length 49.6 characters.
- **T rn15**: 2339 erroneous sentences, 2339 total sentences, average length 31.3 characters.
- **T st13**: 996 erroneous sentences, 1000 total sentences, average length 74.3 characters.
- **T st14**: 529 erroneous sentences, 1000 total sentences, average length 50.0 characters.
- **T st15**: 550 erroneous sentences, 1100 total sentences, average length 30.6 characters.
- **T rnocr**: 4575 sentences from OCR results, 4516 simplified Chinese.
- **T stocr**: OCR results dataset.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
