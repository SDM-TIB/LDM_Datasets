To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Language Modeling with Gated Convolutional Networks" by Yann N. Dauphin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their model achieves state-of-the-art results on the **WikiText-103 benchmark** and competitive results on the **Google Billion Words benchmark**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Google Billion Word Dataset**: This dataset is described as one of the largest language modeling datasets, containing almost one billion tokens and a vocabulary of over 800,000 words. It is based on an English corpus of over 30 million sentences, with words appearing less than three times replaced by a special unknown symbol.

2. **WikiText-103**: This dataset is smaller, with over 100 million tokens and a vocabulary of about 200,000 words. Unlike the Google Billion Word dataset, the sentences in WikiText-103 are consecutive, allowing models to condition on larger contexts rather than single sentences.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Google Billion Word Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chelba, Ciprian, Mikolov, Tomas, Schuster, Mike, Ge, Qi, Brants, Thorsten, Koehn, Philipp, and Robinson, Tony. *One billion word benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.3005, 2013.

- For the **WikiText-103**, the citation is:
  > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., and Socher, R. *Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models*. ArXiv e-prints, September 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
