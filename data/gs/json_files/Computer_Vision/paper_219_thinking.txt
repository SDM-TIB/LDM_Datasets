To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Transformer with Multi-View Visual Representation for Image Captioning" by Jun Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to the **MSCOCO image captioning dataset** as a benchmark for evaluating their approach. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **MSCOCO Dataset**: This dataset is described as a benchmark for various computer vision tasks, including image captioning. It contains 83,000 training images, 40,000 validation images, and 81,000 test images, with each image associated with five captions.

2. **Visual Genome Dataset**: This dataset is used for pre-training object detectors and contains 108,000 images with densely annotated objects, attributes, and relationships.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MSCOCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, L. Bourdev, R. Girshick, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, C. L. Zitnick, and P. Dollár. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1405.0312, 2014.

- For the **Visual Genome Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Krishna, Y. Zhu, O. Groth, J. Johnson, K. Hata, J. Kravitz, S. Chen, Y. Kalantidis, L.-J. Li, D. A. Shamma et al. *Visual genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), vol. 123, no. 1, pp. 32–73, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
