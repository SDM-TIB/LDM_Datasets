To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient and Deep Person Re-Identification using Multi-Level Similarity" by Yiluan Guo and Ngai-Man Cheung, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges in person re-identification (ReID) and reference existing datasets. I will look for specific names of datasets that are used for experiments or comparisons.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors usually detail the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention using four datasets: **CUHK03**, **CUHK01**, and **VIPeR**. I will extract the relevant details about each dataset, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

1. **CUHK03 Dataset**: This dataset contains 13,164 images of 1,360 identities captured by 6 cameras. It has two kinds of pedestrian boxes: detected by algorithms and labeled manually. The authors mention using a specific training, validation, and testing split.

2. **CUHK01 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3,884 images of 971 identities. The authors follow a specific training and testing split as per previous works.

3. **VIPeR Dataset**: This is a smaller dataset with 632 identities, where half are used for training and half for testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, the citations might look like this:

- **CUHK03 Dataset**: 
  > Li, W., Zhao, R., Xiao, T., & Wang, X. (2014). DeepReID: Deep filter pairing neural network for person re-identification. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2014.

- **CUHK01 Dataset**: 
  > Li, W., Zhao, R., & Wang, X. (2012). Human re-identification with transferred metric learning. In Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV), 2012.

- **VIPeR Dataset**: 
  > Gray, D., Brennan, S., & Tao, H. (2007). Evaluating appearance models for recognition, reacquisition, and tracking. In IEEE International Workshop on Performance Evaluation for Tracking and Surveillance (PETS), 2007.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information and their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant details and provide proper citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
