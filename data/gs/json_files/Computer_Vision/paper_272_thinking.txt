To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AllenNLP Interpret: A Framework for Explaining Predictions of NLP Models" by Eric Wallace et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the toolkit's capabilities but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction highlights the use of various models and tasks, which may lead to dataset references.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Interpreting Model Predictions)**, where the authors describe the types of interpretations and models supported by AllenNLP Interpret. Here, they mention specific tasks such as reading comprehension and masked language modeling, which typically rely on well-known datasets.

In **section 2.4 (Currently Available Models)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for reading comprehension tasks: 

1. **SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)**: This dataset is widely used for evaluating reading comprehension models. It consists of over 100,000 questions based on a set of Wikipedia articles.

2. **DROP (Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs)**: This dataset requires models to perform discrete reasoning over paragraphs, making it a challenging benchmark for reading comprehension.

I will confirm the details of these datasets by checking the **References section** for their full citations:

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In EMNLP, 2016.

- For **DROP**, the citation is:
  > Dheeru Dua, Yizhong Wang, Pradeep Dasigi, Gabriel Stanovsky, Sameer Singh, and Matt Gardner. *DROP: A reading comprehension benchmark requiring discrete reasoning over paragraphs*. In NAACL, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
