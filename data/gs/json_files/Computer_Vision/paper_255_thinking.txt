To extract datasets from the research paper titled "adVAE: a Self-adversarial Variational Autoencoder with Gaussian Anomaly Prior Knowledge for Anomaly Detection" by Xuhong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on several datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors summarize the datasets used in their experiments. This section typically provides detailed information about each dataset, including its size, dimensions, and the percentage of outliers.

In this paper, the authors list five datasets:

1. **Letter Dataset**: Size: 1600, Dimensions: 32, Outliers: 100 (6.2%).
2. **Cardio Dataset**: Size: 1831, Dimensions: 21, Outliers: 176 (9.6%).
3. **Satellite Dataset**: Size: 5100, Dimensions: 36, Outliers: 75 (1.5%).
4. **Optical Dataset**: Size: 5216, Dimensions: 64, Outliers: 150 (2.8%).
5. **Pen Dataset**: Size: 6870, Dimensions: 16, Outliers: 156 (2.3%).

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Letter Dataset**: 
  > Rayana, S., & Akoglu, L. (2016). Less is more: Building selective anomaly ensembles. ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, 10(4), 42:1–42:33.

  > Keller, F., Müller, E., & Böhm, K. (2012). HICS: High contrast subspaces for density-based outlier ranking. In International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), 1037–1048.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, size, dimensions, outlier percentage, and full citation for each dataset. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
