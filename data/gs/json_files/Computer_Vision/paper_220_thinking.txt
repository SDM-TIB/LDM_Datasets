To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Argumentative Link Prediction using Residual Networks and Multi-Objective Learning" by Andrea Galassi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and benchmark sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on a "challenging dataset consisting of user-generated comments collected from an online platform," which indicates that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Benchmark)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for evaluation. Here, they mention the **Cornell eRulemaking Corpus (CDCP)**, which consists of 731 user comments from an eRulemaking website, totaling about 4,700 propositions. This section provides detailed information about the dataset's composition and the argument model adopted.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Cornell eRulemaking Corpus. The authors reference the work by Niculae et al. (2017) for the dataset, which is crucial for providing the correct citation.

The citation for the Cornell eRulemaking Corpus is:
> Vlad Niculae, Joonsuk Park, and Claire Cardie. *Argument mining with structured SVMs and RNNs*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2017, Vancouver, Canada, July 30 - August 4, Volume 1: Long Papers, pages 985â€“995. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and organized entry for the dataset used in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
