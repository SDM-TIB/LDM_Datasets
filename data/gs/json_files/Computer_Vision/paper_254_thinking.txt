To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ssEM Image Registration using a Spatial Transformer Network with Learned Features" by Inwan Yoo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method across several datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of serial-section electron microscopy (ssEM) and the need for effective image registration, but they do not specify datasets here. I will need to look further into the methods and results sections for specific dataset names.

Moving to the **results section**, the authors explicitly mention using three EM datasets:

1. **Drosophila TEM Dataset**: This dataset consists of transmission electron microscopy images of the anterior portion of an adult female Drosophila melanogaster brain, with extensive details about the volume and imaging process.

2. **Labeled Drosophila TEM Data from CREMI Challenge**: This dataset is a sub-volume of registered and labeled TEM data used for quantitative assessment of registration quality.

3. **Mouse Brain Scanning EM Dataset**: This dataset includes scanning electron microscopy images of a mouse brain, which contains fold artifacts.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets themselves, but it does reference the original sources of the data:

- For the **Drosophila TEM Dataset**, the authors refer to the work by Hayworth et al. (2014) which describes the imaging process and dataset:
  > Hayworth, K.J., Morgan, J.L., Schalek, R., Berger, D.R., Hildebrand, D.G.C., Lichtman, J.W. *Imaging ATUM ultrathin section libraries with WaferMapper: a multi-scale approach to EM reconstruction of neural circuits*. Frontiers in Neural Circuits 8(June), 68 (2014).

- For the **CREMI Challenge Dataset**, the authors do not provide a specific citation in the references, but they mention it as a known dataset in the field.

- For the **Mouse Brain SEM Dataset**, the authors cite the work by Morgan et al. (2017):
  > Morgan, J.L., Berger, D.R., Wetzel, A.W., Lichtman, J.W. *The fuzzy logic of network connectivity in mouse visual thalamus*. Cell 1, 192â€“206 (2017).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be clearly described along with its full citation to ensure proper attribution.
