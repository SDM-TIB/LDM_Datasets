To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Thai Sentence Segmentation Using Local and Distant Word Representations" by Chanatip Saetia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two Thai datasets (Orchid and UGWC) and one English dataset (IWSLT), which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, I will find specific information about each dataset, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

1. **Orchid Dataset**: This dataset is described as a Thai part-of-speech-tagged dataset containing 10,864 sentences, with no unlabeled data available. The authors mention that the data was manually annotated by linguists.

2. **UGWC Dataset**: This dataset includes user-generated web content in Thai, with 48,374 labeled passages and 96,777 unlabeled passages. The authors explain that the labeled data was manually annotated by linguists, and they provide context about the data collection process.

3. **IWSLT Dataset**: This dataset is used for English punctuation restoration and consists of TED talk transcripts. The authors detail how they separated the dataset into training and validation sets and mention the preprocessing steps taken.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Orchid Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Virach Sornlertlamvanich, Thatsanee Charoenporn, and Hitoshi Isahara. *Orchid: Thai part-of-speech tagged corpus*. National Electronics and Computer Technology Center Technical Report, 1997, pp. 5–19.

- For the **UGWC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Anuruth Lertpiya et al. *A preliminary study on fundamental Thai NLP tasks for user-generated web content*. 2018 International Joint Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (iSAI-NLP), IEEE, 2019, pp. 1–8.

- For the **IWSLT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marcello Federico et al. *Overview of the IWSLT 2012 evaluation campaign*. IWSLT-International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, 2012, pp. 12–33.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
