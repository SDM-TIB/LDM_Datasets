To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Semi-supervised Aspect-term Sentiment Analysis via Transformer" by Xingyi Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions that experimental results are obtained on the **SemEval 2014 task 4**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for the study.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets and Preparation)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **Restaurant (REST) Dataset**: This dataset contains reviews in the restaurant domain, with statistics provided for labeled and unlabeled samples.

2. **Laptop (LAPTOP) Dataset**: This dataset consists of reviews of laptop products, also with labeled and unlabeled sample statistics.

The authors provide additional context about how they processed these datasets, including the removal of certain samples and the use of an aspect extractor for unlabeled data.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The relevant citation for the SemEval 2014 task 4 is:

- For **SemEval 2014 task 4**:
  > Maria Pontiki, Dimitris Galanis, John Pavlopoulos, Ion Androutsopoulos, and Suresh Manandhar. *SemEval-2014 Task 4: Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval@COLING 2014, Dublin, Ireland, August 23-24, 2014, pages 27â€“35.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Restaurant (REST) Dataset** - used for sentiment analysis in the restaurant domain.
2. **Laptop (LAPTOP) Dataset** - used for sentiment analysis in the laptop product domain.
3. **SemEval 2014 task 4** - the overarching dataset reference for the experiments conducted in the paper.

I will ensure to document the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution and further research.
