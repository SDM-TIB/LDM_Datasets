To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Distance Relationships without Time Travel: Boosting the Performance of a Sparse Predictive Autoencoder in Sequence Modeling" by Jeremy Gordon et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a "non-deterministic (stochastic) partially-observable sequence learning task consisting of high-Markov-order sequences of MNIST digits" and also references the **Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset** for a next word prediction task. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), which explicitly discusses the tasks and datasets used. In **section 3.1**, the authors describe the **Stochastic Sequential MNIST (ssMNIST)** task, which is based on sequences of MNIST digits. They provide details about how the sequences are generated and the grammar used for this task. This section confirms that the **ssMNIST** dataset is indeed a key dataset in their experiments.

In **section 3.2**, the authors mention the **Penn Treebank (PTB)** dataset again, stating that they present language modeling results using this dataset with preprocessing as per Mikolov et al. This reinforces the importance of the PTB dataset in their work.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Stochastic Sequential MNIST (ssMNIST)**, the dataset is derived from the original MNIST dataset, which is widely known. The citation for the original MNIST dataset is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

2. For the **Penn Treebank (PTB)** dataset, the citation is:
   > Marcus, M., Kim, G., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., MacIntyre, R., Bies, A., Ferguson, M., Katz, K., and Schasberger, B. *The Penn Treebank: Annotating Predicate Argument Structure*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Human Language Technology, 1994, Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 114â€“119.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **Stochastic Sequential MNIST (ssMNIST)**: A task based on sequences of MNIST digits, generated using a specific grammar.
- **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: A dataset used for language modeling tasks, known for its annotated structure.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
