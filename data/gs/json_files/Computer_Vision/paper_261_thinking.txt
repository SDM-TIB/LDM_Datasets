To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Injecting Hierarchy with U-Net Transformers" by David Donahue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is evaluated on two dialogue datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the application of their model in dialogue generation. They mention the use of the **Cornell Movie Dialogues corpus** and **PersonaChat dataset** for evaluation, which suggests these are the datasets I need to extract.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of both datasets:

1. **Cornell Movie Dialogues corpus**: This dataset consists of two-character dialogues from movie scripts, capturing a variety of human interactions. It contains 60,000 (history, response) pairs, with an average of 3.5 previous utterances per conversation.

2. **PersonaChat dataset**: This dataset is constructed by assigning "personas" to two Mechanical Turkers, who then engage in conversation. It contains longer conversation histories, with an average of 14 utterances per conversation.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Cornell Movie Dialogues corpus**, the citation is:
  > Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lillian Lee. *Chameleons in imagined conversations: A new approach to understanding coordination of linguistic style in dialogs*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics, ACL 2011.

- For the **PersonaChat dataset**, the citation is:
  > Saizheng Zhang, Emily Dinan, Jack Urbanek, Arthur Szlam, Douwe Kiela, and Jason Weston. *Personalizing dialogue agents: I have a dog, do you have pets too?* arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.07243.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
