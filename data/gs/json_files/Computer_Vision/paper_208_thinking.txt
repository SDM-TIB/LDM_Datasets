To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Syntactic and Semantic Information in Word Embeddings using Graph Convolutional Networks" by Shikhar Vashishth et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions of the paper, and it may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets used in previous studies or their own experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior works that utilized specific datasets.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors may describe the datasets in terms of their size, content, and how they were utilized in their experiments. This section is crucial for understanding the specifics of the datasets.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors provide results based on specific datasets. They may mention datasets used for intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations, which will help confirm their relevance.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Wikipedia corpus** for training, I will look for the citation that describes this dataset. Similarly, if they reference datasets like **Simlex-999** or **CoNLL-2003**, I will find their respective citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identify specific datasets and their descriptions.
3. Check the references section for full citations of each dataset.
4. Compile the information into a structured format for clarity and accessibility.
