To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalizing Spatial Transformers to Projective Geometry with Applications to 2D/3D Registration" by Cong Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of their method to 2D/3D registration, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of medical imaging.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors describe their simulation study and real X-ray study. In the simulation study, they mention using **17 full body CT scans from the NIH Cancer Imaging Archive** for training and testing purposes. This indicates a specific dataset that is crucial for their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results or discussion sections**. However, the primary dataset appears to be the NIH Cancer Imaging Archive CT scans, which is explicitly stated.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NIH Cancer Imaging Archive dataset. The citation is typically formatted as follows:

- For the NIH Cancer Imaging Archive, the citation is:
  > Clark, K., Vendt, B. J., Kauffman, T., et al. *The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA): Maintaining and Operating a Public Information Repository*. Journal of Digital Imaging, 26(6), 1045-1057, 2013.

Since the authors do not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the NIH Cancer Imaging Archive dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the NIH Cancer Imaging Archive, ensuring that it is ready for downstream processing or review.
