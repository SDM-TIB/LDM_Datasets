To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequential Latent Knowledge Selection for Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue" by Jaewoo Ahn, Byeongchang Kim, and Gunhee Kim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on the **Wizard of Wikipedia** dataset and validated their model on the **Holl-E dataset**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors provide a clear description of both datasets:

1. **Wizard of Wikipedia**: This dataset contains 18,430 dialogues for training, 1,948 for validation, and 1,933 for testing. It is split into two subsets: Test Seen and Test Unseen, with specific counts for each.

2. **Holl-E**: This dataset includes 7,228 dialogues for training, 930 for validation, and 913 for testing. It provides a single document per dialogue, with additional information about spans in the document.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Wizard of Wikipedia**:

- For **Holl-E**:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
