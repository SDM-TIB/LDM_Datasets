To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explicit Disentanglement of Appearance and Perspective in Generative Models" by Nicki S. Detlefsen and SÃ¸ren Hauberg, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, it states that the model is evaluated on four datasets, which is a clear indication that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and results. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **dSprites Dataset**: This dataset is a well-established benchmark for evaluating disentanglement algorithms. The authors mention it in the context of their experiments, indicating its relevance.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors describe using the MNIST dataset, which is a widely known dataset of handwritten digits, for testing their model's ability to disentangle style and content.

3. **SMPL Dataset**: The authors generate synthetic images of human bodies using the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL). They mention generating 10,000 bodies for their experiments, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

4. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset is used for qualitative evaluation, and the authors describe how they model facial features and shapes using this dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **dSprites Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Matthey, L., Higgins, I., Hassabis, D., & Lerchner, A. (2017). *dsprites: Disentanglement testing sprites dataset*. Retrieved from https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset/

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11), 2278-2324.

- For the **SMPL Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Loper, M., Mahmood, N., Romero, J., Pons-Moll, G., & Black, M. J. (2015). *SMPL: A skinned multi-person linear model*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (Proc. SIGGRAPH Asia), 34(6), 248:1-248:16.

- For the **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
