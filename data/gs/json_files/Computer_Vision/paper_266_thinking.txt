To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GQ-STN: Optimizing One-Shot Grasp Detection based on Robustness Classifier" by Alexandre Gariépy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions the use of the **Dex-Net 2.0 dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. In the **Problem Description section**, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the **Dex-Net 2.0 dataset**, describing it as a large-scale simulated dataset for parallel-gripper grasping, containing 6.7 million grasps on pre-rendered depth images of 3D models. This section also explains the sources of the 3D models and the method of obtaining grasp labels, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's context.

I will also check the **Experiments and Evaluation section** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned. The authors reference the **Jacquard dataset** for testing their models, which is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. For the **Dex-Net 2.0 dataset**, the citation is:
> Mahler, J., Liang, J., Niyaz, S., Laskey, M., Doan, R., Liu, J. A., & Goldberg, K. (2017). *Dex-Net 2.0: Deep Learning to Plan Robust Grasps with Synthetic Point Clouds and Analytic Grasp Metrics*. In Proceedings of the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS).

For the **Jacquard dataset**, the citation is:
> Depierre, A., Dellandréa, E., & Chen, L. (2018). *Jacquard: A large scale dataset for robotic grasp detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS).

After gathering this information, I will prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include all relevant details and citations as required.
