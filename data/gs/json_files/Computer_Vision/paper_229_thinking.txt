To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptively Sparse Transformers" by Gonçalo M. Correia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their method on machine translation datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly list four machine translation datasets:

1. **IWSLT 2017 German → English (DE → EN)**: This dataset contains 200,000 sentence pairs and is referenced as being from the IWSLT 2017 evaluation campaign.

2. **KFTT Japanese → English (JA → EN)**: This dataset consists of 300,000 sentence pairs and is attributed to the Kyoto Free Translation Task.

3. **WMT 2016 Romanian → English (RO → EN)**: This dataset includes 600,000 sentence pairs and is referenced in the findings of the 2016 conference on machine translation.

4. **WMT 2014 English → German (EN → DE)**: This dataset has 4.5 million sentence pairs and is also referenced in the findings of the 2014 workshop on statistical machine translation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **IWSLT 2017**, the citation is:
  > M. Cettolo, M. Federico, L. Bentivogli, et al. *Overview of the IWSLT 2017 evaluation campaign*. In Proceedings of the IWSLT, 2017.

- For **KFTT**, the citation is:
  > Graham Neubig. *The Kyoto Free Translation Task*. 2011. Available at: http://www.phontron.com/kftt.

- For **WMT 2016**, the citation is:
  > Ondrej Bojar, Rajen Chatterjee, Christian Federmann, et al. *Findings of the 2016 conference on machine translation*. In Proceedings of the WMT, 2016.

- For **WMT 2014**, the citation is:
  > Ondrej Bojar, Christian Buck, Christian Federmann, et al. *Findings of the 2014 workshop on statistical machine translation*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, 2014.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
