To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LXMERT: Learning Cross-Modality Encoder Representations from Transformers" by Hao Tan and Mohit Bansal, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on two visual question answering datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention the datasets in **section 4.1 (Evaluated Datasets)**. Here, they explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **VQA v2.0 Dataset**: This dataset is used for visual question answering and is mentioned as having 1.1 million questions related to images.
2. **GQA Dataset**: This dataset is also for visual question answering but requires more reasoning skills, containing 22 million questions generated from ground truth image scene graphs.
3. **NLVR2 Dataset**: This dataset is used for visual reasoning and consists of pairs of images and natural language statements, with a total of 86K training examples.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **VQA v2.0 Dataset**:
  > Stanislaw Antol, Aishwarya Agrawal, Jiasen Lu, Margaret Mitchell, Dhruv Batra, C Lawrence Zitnick, and Devi Parikh. *VQA: Visual Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 2425â€“2433, 2015.

- For **GQA Dataset**:
  > Drew A Hudson and Christopher D Manning. *GQA: A New Dataset for Compositional Question Answering over Real-World Images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2019.

- For **NLVR2 Dataset**:
  > Alane Suhr, Stephanie Zhou, Iris Zhang, Huajun Bai, and Yoav Artzi. *A Corpus for Reasoning about Natural Language Grounded in Photographs*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
