To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GPipe: Easy Scaling with Micro-Batch Pipeline Parallelism" by Yanping Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that GPipe was demonstrated on two tasks: image classification and multilingual neural machine translation, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections** to find specific datasets used in the experiments. In the results section, the authors mention training on the **ImageNet 2012 dataset** for image classification and a **massively multilingual corpus** for machine translation. I need to gather more details about these datasets.

In the **image classification section**, the authors specify that they trained the AmoebaNet model on the **ImageNet 2012 dataset**, which consists of 1,281,167 training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 classes. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I will need to note its details.

For the **multilingual neural machine translation**, the authors describe using a corpus of parallel documents over **102 languages** with a total of 25 billion training examples. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, so I will note it as a general multilingual corpus.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **ImageNet 2012 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In CVPR. IEEE, 2009.

2. The multilingual corpus does not have a specific citation in the paper, but I will note it as a general dataset used for multilingual machine translation.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **ImageNet 2012 dataset**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification, containing 1,281,167 training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 classes.
- **Massively multilingual corpus**: A dataset used for multilingual neural machine translation, containing parallel documents across 102 languages with a total of 25 billion training examples.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
