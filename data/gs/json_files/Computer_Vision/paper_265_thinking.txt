To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FastSpeech: Fast, Robust and Controllable Text to Speech" by Yi Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on the **LJSpeech dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they specifically mention the **LJSpeech dataset** and provide a description of its contents, including the number of audio clips and the total audio length.

In section 4.1, the authors state:
- **LJSpeech dataset**: This dataset contains 13,100 English audio clips and the corresponding text transcripts, with a total audio length of approximately 24 hours. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on the LJSpeech dataset for extraction.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the LJSpeech dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Keith Ito. *The LJ Speech Dataset*. https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/, 2017.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: LJSpeech
   - **Description**: Contains 13,100 English audio clips and corresponding text transcripts, totaling approximately 24 hours of audio.
   - **Citation**: Keith Ito. *The LJ Speech Dataset*. https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/, 2017.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
