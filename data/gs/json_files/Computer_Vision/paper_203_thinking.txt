To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Semi-Supervised End-to-End Scene Text Recognition" by Christian Bartz, Haojin Yang, and Christoph Meinel, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors performed experiments on standard benchmark datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors detail the datasets used for their evaluations. They mention using the **SVHN dataset** and the **French Street Name Signs (FSNS) dataset**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In the experiments section, the authors describe the **SVHN dataset** as containing images of house numbers, which they used to demonstrate the feasibility of their approach. They also mention that they generated more complex datasets based on SVHN images for further testing.

The **FSNS dataset** is described as containing over 1 million images of French street name signs, which are more challenging due to their irregular text and distracting backgrounds. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the performance of their proposed system.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **SVHN dataset**, the citation is:
   > Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., and Ng, A. Y. (2011). *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, volume 2011, 5.

2. For the **FSNS dataset**, the citation is:
   > Smith, R., Gu, C., Lee, D.-S., Hu, H., Unnikrishnan, R., Ibarz, J., Arnoud, S., and Lin, S. (2016). *End-to-end interpretation of the French street name signs dataset*. In Computer Vision - ECCV 2016 Workshops, 411â€“426. Springer, Cham.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
