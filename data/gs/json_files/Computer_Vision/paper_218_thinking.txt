To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One Shot Learning for Deformable Medical Image Registration and Periodic Motion Tracking" by Tobias Fechter and Dimos Baltas, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the algorithm was tested on multiple publicly available 3D and 4D datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Data section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they describe three datasets:

1. **DirLab Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10 4D CTs of the thoracic region, each containing 10 3D CTs and manually set reference landmarks for registration evaluation. The authors provide additional details about the landmarks in the dataset.

2. **Popi Dataset**: Provided by the Léon Bérard Cancer Center & CREATIS lab, this dataset includes six 4D CTs, each with 10 3D CTs. It also contains landmarks for registration evaluation, with specific details about how landmarks were identified for different patients.

3. **Sunnybrook Dataset**: This dataset consists of 12 cardiac MRI datasets, which were used for evaluating the algorithm's performance. The datasets include cine-MRI images from patients with various pathologies and expert-drawn contours for validation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **DirLab Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Castillo, R., et al. "A framework for evaluation of deformable image registration spatial accuracy using large landmark point sets." *Physics in Medicine & Biology*, vol. 54, no. 7, 2009.

- For the **Popi Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Castillo, E., et al. "Four-dimensional deformable image registration using trajectory modeling." *Physics in Medicine & Biology*, vol. 55, no. 1, 2010.

- For the **Sunnybrook Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Radau, P., et al. "Evaluation framework for algorithms segmenting short axis cardiac MRI." *The MIDAS Journal-Cardiac MR Left Ventricle Segmentation Challenge*, vol. 49, 2009.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
