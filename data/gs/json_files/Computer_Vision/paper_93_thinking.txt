To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-Shot Learning via Embedding Adaptation with Set-to-Set Functions" by Han-Jia Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method on "both the standard few-shot classification benchmark and four extended few-shot learning settings," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **MiniImageNet**: This dataset is described as a subset of ImageNet, containing 100 classes with 600 examples per class. The authors follow a specific setup for training and validation.

2. **TieredImageNet**: Another subset of ImageNet, this dataset includes 351, 97, and 160 categories for training, validation, and evaluation, respectively.

3. **CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds 200-2011)**: This dataset consists of 11,788 images of birds across 200 species, with a specific sampling strategy for few-shot learning tasks.

4. **OfficeHome**: This dataset is used to validate the generalization ability of the proposed method across domains, containing images from four different domains.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MiniImageNet**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for structured output or further processing.
