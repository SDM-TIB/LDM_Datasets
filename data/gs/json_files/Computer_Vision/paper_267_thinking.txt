To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ESPNET-TTS: Unified, Reproducible, and Integratable Open Source End-to-End Text-to-Speech Toolkit" by Tomoki Hayashi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the toolkit achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **LJSpeech dataset**, indicating that this dataset is likely important.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experimental evaluation** section. In this paper, there is a **Table 2** that summarizes the supported datasets in ESPnet-TTS. This table lists several datasets along with their characteristics, which is crucial for my extraction.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **LJSpeech**: This dataset consists of 24 hours of English speech from a single speaker, with 12,600 utterances for training, 250 for validation, and 250 for evaluation.

2. **Blizzard17**: A single speaker dataset in English.

3. **ARCTIC**: Another single speaker dataset in English.

4. **CSMSC**: A Mandarin Chinese dataset.

5. **JNAS**: A Japanese dataset.

6. **JSUT**: A Japanese speech corpus.

7. **JVS**: A multi-speaker Japanese voice corpus.

8. **LibriTTS**: A corpus derived from LibriSpeech for text-to-speech.

9. **M-AILABS**: A dataset that supports multiple languages.

10. **TWEB**: A single speaker English dataset.

11. **VAIS1000**: A Vietnamese speech synthesis corpus.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Here are the citations I found:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
