To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CRAM: Clued Recurrent Attention Model" by Minki Chung and Sungzoon Cho, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the Clued Recurrent Attention Model (CRAM) to two computer vision tasks: image classification and inpainting. This suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be included.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section VI) where the authors describe their evaluation methods. Here, they mention using the **Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset** for the inpainting task. The description states that the SVHN dataset contains 73,257 training digits and 26,032 testing digits, with images sized 32x32 in RGB color scale. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citation for the SVHN dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu, and A. Y. Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, vol. 2011, no. 2, 2011, p. 5.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the SVHN dataset for the inpainting task, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included and accurately represented.
