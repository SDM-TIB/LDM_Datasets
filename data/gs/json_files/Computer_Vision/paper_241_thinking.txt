To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Enriched Deep Recurrent Visual Attention Model for Multiple Object Recognition" by Artsiom Ablavatski et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their model has been evaluated on **two publicly available datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention the use of the **SVHN dataset** and the **MNIST Cluttered dataset**. This gives me the names of the datasets, but I need to gather more details about them.

I will then look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide more context about the datasets. They describe the **MNIST Cluttered dataset** as containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits in a cluttered background. The **SVHN dataset** is described as containing around 250,000 real-world images of digits taken from house numbers, with a test set formed from 13,000 images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Cluttered dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. K. Sønderby, C. K. Sønderby, L. Maaløe, and O. Winther. *Recurrent spatial transformer networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1509.05329, 2015.

- For the **SVHN dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu, and A. Y. Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, volume 2011, page 4. Granada, Spain, 2011.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **MNIST Cluttered Dataset**: Contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits in a cluttered background.
2. **SVHN Dataset**: Contains around 250,000 real-world images of digits taken from house numbers, with a test set formed from 13,000 images.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
