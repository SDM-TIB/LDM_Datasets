To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Perturbation Analysis for Scalable Certified Robustness and Beyond" by Kaidi Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of **Tiny ImageNet** and **Downscaled ImageNet** for demonstrating the authors' framework, indicating that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in section 4, where they evaluate their method on various datasets. I will focus on this section to find specific details about the datasets used.

Upon reviewing section 4, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Tiny ImageNet**: The authors state that they demonstrate LiRPA-based certified defense on Tiny ImageNet, which consists of 200 classes and 100,000 images. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **Downscaled ImageNet**: This dataset is also mentioned as part of their experiments, specifically for certifying robustness in models with a large number of classes (1,000 classes). 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Le, Y., & Yang, X. (2015). *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N.

- For **Downscaled ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Chrabaszcz, P., Loshchilov, I., & Hutter, F. (2017). *A downsampled variant of ImageNet as an alternative to the CIFAR datasets*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.08819.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
