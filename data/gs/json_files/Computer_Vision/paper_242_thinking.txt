To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Linearized Multi-Sampling for Differentiable Image Transformation" by Wei Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and its applications, which may hint at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets they used for their experiments. In this section, they state: "Our datasets: MNIST, GTSRB, and Pascal VOC 2012." This indicates that these datasets are central to their evaluation.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of each dataset in the paper. The authors provide some context about how they used these datasets, which will help me understand their significance in the experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE, pages 2278–2324, 1998.

2. **GTSRB Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Johannes Stallkamp, Marc Schlipsing, Jan Salmen, and Christian Igel. *The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark: A multi-class classification competition*. In IJCNN, 2011.

3. **Pascal VOC 2012 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Mark Everingham, John Winn, I. Williams, Luc Van Gool, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2012 (VOC2012) Results*. http://www.pascal-network.org/challenges/VOC/voc2012/workshop/index.html.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
