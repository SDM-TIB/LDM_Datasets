To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Semi-Supervised End-to-End Scene Text Recognition" by Christian Bartz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors performed experiments on "standard benchmark datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section, the authors explicitly mention using the **SVHN dataset** and the **French Street Name Signs (FSNS) dataset** for their evaluations. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial for understanding their research.

I will then gather detailed descriptions of these datasets from the relevant sections. The paper states that:

1. **SVHN Dataset**: This dataset is used to prove the feasibility of their concept. It consists of images of house numbers, which are often noisy and contain background distractions.

2. **French Street Name Signs (FSNS) Dataset**: This dataset contains over 1 million images of French street name signs extracted from Google Streetview. It is noted for its complexity due to irregular text lines and challenging backgrounds.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **SVHN dataset**, the citation is:
  > Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., and Ng, A. Y. (2011). *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, volume 2011, 5.

- For the **FSNS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Smith, R., Gu, C., Lee, D.-S., Hu, H., Unnikrishnan, R., Ibarz, J., Arnoud, S., and Lin, S. (2016). *End-to-end interpretation of the French street name signs dataset*. In Computer Vision - ECCV 2016 Workshops, 411â€“426. Springer, Cham.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
