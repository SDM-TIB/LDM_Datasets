To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Composite Shape Modeling via Latent Space Factorization" by Anastasia Dubrovina et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention a novel neural network architecture for 3D shape modeling and refer to the use of large-scale 3D shape datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the **experiments section (4)**, the authors explicitly state that they used models from the **ShapeNet 3D data collection** with part annotations produced by Yi et al. This is a clear indication of the dataset used for their experiments.

I will then gather more details about the **ShapeNet dataset** from the text. The authors describe how the shapes were converted to occupancy grids and how semantic part labels were assigned. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **ShapeNet dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- **ShapeNet 3D data collection**:
  > Angel X Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

Since the paper primarily discusses the **ShapeNet dataset**, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
