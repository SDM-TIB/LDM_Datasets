To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Detecting Lane and Road Markings at A Distance with Perspective Transformer Layers" by Zhuoping Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their method is validated on two public datasets: **TuSimple** and **ApolloScape**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section IV, the authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **TuSimple Dataset**: This dataset is dedicated to lane detection and consists of 3,626 training and 2,782 testing images. The annotations include the x-positions of lane points at various discretized y-positions.

2. **ApolloScape Dataset**: This dataset contains over 110,000 frames with high-quality pixel-level annotations for lane and road markings, including 35 different types of markings such as lanes, turning arrows, stop lines, and zebra crossings.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **TuSimple Dataset**, the citation is:
  > TuSimple lane detection benchmark. http://benchmark.tusimple.ai/.

- For the **ApolloScape Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xinyu Huang, Xinjing Cheng, Qichuan Geng, Binbin Cao, Dingfu Zhou, Peng Wang, Yuanqing Lin, and Ruigang Yang. *The ApolloScape Dataset for Autonomous Driving*. arXiv: 1803.06184, 2018.

With this information, I have successfully identified and documented the datasets used in the paper, along with their full citations. I will now compile this information into the required format for further processing.
