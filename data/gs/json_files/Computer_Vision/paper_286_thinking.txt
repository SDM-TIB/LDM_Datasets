To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks" by James Bradbury et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets used in the evaluations. The authors typically describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics and the tasks they are used for. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention three datasets:

1. **IMDb Movie Review Dataset**: This dataset is used for document-level sentiment classification. It consists of 50,000 reviews (25,000 positive and 25,000 negative), split into training and testing sets, with an average document length of 231 words.

2. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: This dataset is utilized for language modeling. It is a standard preprocessed version used in various studies, which includes a collection of text data suitable for training language models.

3. **IWSLT German-English Translation Dataset**: This dataset is used for character-level neural machine translation. It contains 209,772 sentence pairs from TED and TEDx presentations, with specific constraints on sentence length.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **IMDb Movie Review Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L. Maas, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher D. Manning. *Multi-dimensional sentiment analysis with learned representations*. Technical report, 2011.

- For the **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Tomas Mikolov, Martin Karafiát, Lukáš Burget, Jan Cernocký, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Recurrent neural network based language model*. In INTERSPEECH, 2010.

- For the **IWSLT German-English Translation Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marc’Aurelio Ranzato, Sumit Chopra, Michael Auli, and Wojciech Zaremba. *Sequence level training with recurrent neural networks*. In ICLR, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
