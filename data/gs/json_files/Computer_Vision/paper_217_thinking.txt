To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classification based Grasp Detection using Spatial Transformer Network" by Dongwon Park and Se Young Chun, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but the introduction and experimental results sections are likely to contain more detailed information about the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of robotic grasp detection and mention various methods, but they do not explicitly name any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **experimental results section**.

In **section IV (Experimental Results)**, the authors state that they trained and tested their method using the **Cornell grasp detection dataset**. They describe this dataset as containing 855 images (RGB color and depth) of 240 different objects, along with ground truth labels for graspable and non-graspable rectangles. This is a clear identification of the dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Cornell grasp detection dataset. The citation is as follows:
> I. Lenz, H. Lee, and A. Saxena. "Deep learning for detecting robotic grasps." *The International Journal of Robotics Research*, vol. 34, no. 4-5, pp. 705â€“724, Apr. 2015.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial context.
2. Focus on the experimental results section to find specific datasets.
3. Identify the **Cornell grasp detection dataset** as the primary dataset used.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entry for downstream processing.
