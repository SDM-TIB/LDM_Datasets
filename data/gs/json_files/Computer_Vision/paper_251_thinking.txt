To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Do Neural Language Models Show Preferences for Syntactic Formalisms?" by Artur Kulmizev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may include references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Design)**, where the authors discuss the languages and treebanks used in their experiments. Here, they mention that they reuse a sample from Kulmizev et al. (2019) and utilize treebanks from Universal Dependencies (UD) v2.4 and their conversions into Surface-Syntactic Universal Dependencies (SUD). This indicates that these treebanks are the primary datasets for their analysis.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide detailed statistics about the treebanks, including the number of sentences and the specific treebanks used for each language. The languages and their corresponding treebanks are as follows:

1. **Arabic**: PADT (Penn Arabic Dependency Treebank)
2. **Chinese**: GSD (Generalized Syntactic Dependency)
3. **English**: EWT (English Web Treebank)
4. **Basque**: BDT (Basque Dependency Treebank)
5. **Finnish**: TDT (Finnish Dependency Treebank)
6. **Hebrew**: HTB (Hebrew Treebank)
7. **Hindi**: HDTB (Hindi Dependency Treebank)
8. **Italian**: ISDT (Italian Syntax Dependency Treebank)
9. **Japanese**: GSD (Generalized Syntactic Dependency)
10. **Korean**: GSD (Generalized Syntactic Dependency)
11. **Russian**: SynTagRus (Russian Dependency Treebank)
12. **Swedish**: Talbanken (Swedish Dependency Treebank)
13. **Turkish**: IMST (Istanbul University Dependency Treebank)

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the Universal Dependencies project and the specific treebanks are crucial for proper documentation.

The citation for the Universal Dependencies project is:
> Nivre, J., de Marneffe, M.-C., Ginter, F., Goldberg, Y., Hajič, J., Manning, C. D., McDonald, R., Petrov, S., Pyysalo, S., Silveira, N., Tsarfaty, R., & Zeman, D. (2016). Universal Dependencies v1: A multilingual treebank collection. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’16), pages 1659–1666, Portorož, Slovenia. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

For the specific treebanks, I will look for individual citations in the references. For example, the citation for the Penn Arabic Dependency Treebank (PADT) is:
> Maamouri, M., & Bies, A. (2004). The Penn Arabic Treebank: Building a Large-Scale Annotated Arabic Corpus. In Proceedings of the 2004 International Conference on Arabic Language Processing.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
