To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Transformers for Diverse Response Generation" by Zhaojiang Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed models are evaluated on three conversational datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will note this down as a key point.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **MojiTalk**: This dataset consists of 596,959 post and response pairs from Twitter, with each response labeled by one emoji indicating the response emotion. The authors reference the preprocessing and vocabulary from a previous work.

2. **PersonaChat**: This dataset involves one-to-one multi-turn conversations revolving around personas established by four to six persona sentences.

3. **Empathetic-Dialogues**: Similar to PersonaChat, this dataset focuses on conversations where one speaker tries to understand the feelings of another speaker based on a situation.

In this section, the authors also mention that they combine the train/validation/test sets of the PersonaChat and Empathetic-Dialogues datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **MojiTalk**, the citation is:
  > Xianda Zhou and William Yang Wang. *Mojitalk: Generating emotional responses at scale*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1128–1137, 2018.

- For **PersonaChat**, the citation is:
  > Saizheng Zhang, Emily Dinan, Jack Urbanek, Arthur Szlam, Douwe Kiela, and Jason Weston. *Personalizing dialogue agents: I have a dog, do you have pets too?* In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 2204–2213, 2018.

- For **Empathetic-Dialogues**, the citation is:
  > Hannah Rashkin, Eric Michael Smith, Margaret Li, and Y-Lan Boureau. *Towards empathetic open-domain conversation models: A new benchmark and dataset*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 5370–5381, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
