To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial Transformer for 3D Point Clouds" by Jiayun Wang, Rudrasis Chakraborty, and Stella X. Yu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their method to the **ShapeNet part segmentation dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for benchmarking their methods. In this section, they mention using the **ModelNet40 dataset** for 3D shape classification and the **ShapeNet part segmentation dataset** for part segmentation tasks. This confirms that both datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **related work** or **conclusion sections**. However, in this paper, the focus remains on the two datasets already identified.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **ShapeNet part segmentation dataset**:
   > A. X. Chang, T. Funkhouser, L. Guibas, P. Hanrahan, Q. Huang, Z. Li, S. Savarese, M. Savva, S. Song, H. Su et al. "ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository." arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

2. **ModelNet40 dataset**:
   > A. Wu, Y. Zhang, T. X. Han, and L. J. Guibas. "3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **ShapeNet part segmentation dataset**: This dataset contains 16,881 shapes from 16 categories, annotated with 50 parts in total, and is used for part segmentation tasks.
- **ModelNet40 dataset**: This dataset consists of 12,311 3D CAD models from 40 categories, used for 3D shape classification tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
