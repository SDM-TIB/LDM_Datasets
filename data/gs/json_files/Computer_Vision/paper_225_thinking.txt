To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STN-OCR: A single Neural Network for Text Detection and Text Recognition" by Christian Bartz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "public benchmark datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets used in their research. I will look for any dataset names mentioned directly in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors discuss their experimental setup and results. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics.

In section 4.2, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **SVHN dataset**. They describe it as a dataset used for recognizing house numbers in natural images. I will note down the details provided about this dataset.

In section 4.3, the authors refer to the **ICDAR 2013** dataset, which is a benchmark for robust reading. They provide results from their experiments on this dataset, indicating its relevance to their work.

Additionally, in section 4.4, the authors mention the **French Street Name Signs (FSNS)** dataset, which they describe as a challenging dataset containing images of street signs extracted from Google Streetview. This dataset is also crucial for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each of the datasets mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

1. For the **SVHN dataset**, the citation is:
   > Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu, and A. Y. Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, volume 2011, page 5, 2011.

2. For the **ICDAR 2013 dataset**, the citation is:
   > D. Karatzas, F. Shafait, S. Uchida, M. Iwamura, L. G. i Bigorda, S. R. Mestre, J. Mas, D. F. Mota, J. A. Almazan, and L. P. de las Heras. *ICDAR 2013 robust reading competition*. In 2013 12th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, pages 1484–1493. IEEE, 2013.

3. For the **French Street Name Signs (FSNS) dataset**, the citation is:
   > R. Smith, C. Gu, D.-S. Lee, H. Hu, R. Unnikrishnan, J. Ibarz, S. Arnoud, and S. Lin. *End-to-end interpretation of the french street name signs dataset*. In Computer Vision - ECCV 2016 Workshops, pages 411–426. Springer, Cham, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
