To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Theory and Experiments on Vector Quantized Autoencoders" by Aurko Roy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the VQ-VAE on datasets like CIFAR-10, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their methods on two datasets: **CIFAR-10** for image generation and **WMT English-German** for machine translation. 

I will then gather detailed descriptions of these datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is widely used for training machine learning models in image classification tasks.

2. **WMT English-German**: This dataset is part of the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT) and is used for training and evaluating machine translation systems. It contains parallel corpora for English and German sentences.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

- For **WMT English-German**, the citation is:
  > Philipp Koehn, Christof Monz, and others. *Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the 2007 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1â€“8, 2007.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
