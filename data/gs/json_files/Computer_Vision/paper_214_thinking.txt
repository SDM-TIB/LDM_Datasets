To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning a Layout Transfer Network for Context Aware Object Detection" by Tao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three public datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will look for specific names of these datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **MIOvision Traffic Camera Dataset (MIO-TCD)**: This dataset is described as the largest public benchmark for object detection in traffic surveillance images, containing 110,000 images for training and 27,743 images for testing.

2. **Bosch Small Traffic Lights Dataset**: This dataset presents a challenge for detecting small objects with partial occlusions, consisting of 5,093 training images and 8,334 testing images.

3. **KITTI Object Detection Dataset**: This dataset includes 7,481 training images and 7,518 testing images, focusing on the detection of cars, which is the largest object category.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow readers to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **MIO-TCD**:
  > Zhiming Luo, Frédéric Branchaud-Charron, Claude Lemaire, Jean Konrad, Shuang Li, Abhishek Mishra, Alex Achkar, Jean Eichel, and Pierre-Marc Jodoin. "MIO-TCD: A new benchmark dataset for vehicle classification and localization." *IEEE Transactions on Image Processing*, vol. 27, no. 10, pp. 5129–5141, 2018.

- For **Bosch Small Traffic Lights**:
  > Klaus Behrendt, Lukas Novak, and Rami Botros. "A deep learning approach to traffic lights: Detection, tracking, and classification." In *ICRA*, 2017, pp. 1370–1377.

- For **KITTI**:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Christoph Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. "Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset." *International Journal of Robotics Research*, vol. 32, no. 11, pp. 1231–1237, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and comprehensively.
