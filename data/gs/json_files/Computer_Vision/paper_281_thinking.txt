To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weakly-Supervised Caricature Face Parsing through Domain Adaptation" by Wenqing Chu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize real photos and caricatures for their experiments, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for labeled datasets for face parsing and mention that they will exploit available real-face parsing datasets for domain adaptation. This hints at specific datasets being used, so I will look for their names.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. They state that they employ the **HELEN dataset** as the source domain, which contains 2,330 face photos with labeled facial components. They also mention the **WebCaricature dataset** as the target domain, which consists of 6,042 caricatures collected from the web and provides 17 landmarks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **HELEN dataset**, the citation is:
   > Brandon M. Smith, Li Zhang, Jonathan Brandt, Zhe Lin, and Jianchao Yang. "Exemplar-based face parsing." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1689-1696, 2013.

2. For the **WebCaricature dataset**, the citation is:
   > Jing Huo, Wenbin Li, Yinghuan Shi, Yang Gao, and Hujun Yin. "Webcaricature: a benchmark for caricature recognition." In British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC), 2018.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
