To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rotations and Interpretability of Word Embeddings: the Case of the Russian Language" by Alexey Zobnin, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the study involves publicly available models for the Russian language, which suggests that datasets may be referenced.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses various word embedding models and their interpretability, but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, it is important to note that the paper focuses on models trained on specific corpora, which may imply the use of certain datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the author describes the models used for the experiments. Here, the author lists three specific models:

1. **RusVectores**: This model is based on word2vec and trained on different Russian corpora. The paper provides a link to the models, which is crucial for citation purposes.

2. **Russian Distributional Thesaurus (RDT)**: This model is also based on word2vec skip-gram and trained on a Russian books corpus. The paper cites the source of this model, which is important for the full citation.

3. **fastText**: This model is trained on Russian Wikipedia. The author provides a link to the pretrained vectors, which will be included in the citation.

I will now gather the full citations for each of these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **RusVectores**, the citation is:
  > Kutuzov, A., & Andreev, I. (2015). *WebVectors: A Toolkit for Building Web Interfaces for Vector Semantic Models*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Technologies (pp. 155–161). Springer.

- For **Russian Distributional Thesaurus (RDT)**, the citation is:
  > Panchenko, A., Ustalov, D., Arefyev, N., Paperno, D., Konstantinova, N., Loukachevitch, N., & Biemann, C. (2017). *Human and Machine Judgements for Russian Semantic Relatedness*. In Proceedings of the AIST 2016 (pp. 221–235). Yekaterinburg, Russia.

- For **fastText**, the citation is:
  > Bojanowski, P., Grave, E., Joulin, A., & Mikolov, T. (2016). *Enriching Word Vectors with Subword Information*. arXiv:1607.04606.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
