To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compressing BERT: Studying the Effects of Weight Pruning on Transfer Learning" by Mitchell A. Gordon et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of BERT on the **General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark**, which suggests that this benchmark is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experimental setup** section. In section 3.1, the authors mention that they fine-tuned their pruned models on tasks from the **GLUE benchmark**, which consists of several tasks including sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and textual similarity evaluation. This indicates that the GLUE benchmark is a collection of datasets rather than a single dataset.

I will then check the **results section** to see if the authors provide more details about the specific tasks included in the GLUE benchmark. They mention tasks like **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**, **QQP (Quora Question Pairs)**, **SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**, **QNLI (Question Natural Language Inference)**, and **CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability)**. Each of these tasks corresponds to a specific dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **GLUE Benchmark**: The citation for the GLUE benchmark is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation.
