To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Deep Context-aware Features over Body and Latent Parts for Person Re-identification" by Dangwei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on several large-scale person ReID datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Protocols)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Market1501**: This dataset contains 1,501 identities captured by six cameras, totaling 32,368 pedestrian images. The authors specify that 751 identities are used for training and 750 for testing.

2. **CUHK03**: This dataset includes 1,360 identities captured by six surveillance cameras, with a total of 13,164 person images. The authors note that they use both manually annotated bounding boxes and those detected using a specific model for their experiments.

3. **MARS**: This is described as the largest sequence-based person ReID dataset, containing 1,261 identities and 20,478 tracklets, with 1,191,003 bounding boxes. The authors indicate that they use 625 identities for training and 631 for testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Market1501**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, L., Shen, L., Tian, L., Wang, S., Wang, J., & Tian, Q. (2015). Scalable person re-identification: A benchmark. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

- For **CUHK03**, the citation is:
  > Li, W., Zhao, R., Xiao, T., & Wang, X. (2014). DeepReID: Deep filter pairing neural network for person re-identification. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2014.

- For **MARS**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
