To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PipeMare: Asynchronous Pipeline Parallel DNN Training" by Bowen Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. I will look for a subsection specifically dedicated to datasets or any mention of datasets in the context of the experiments. This section often includes descriptions of the datasets, such as their size, type, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

For this paper, I will identify the following datasets mentioned in the experiments:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **ImageNet**: A large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research. It contains millions of images across thousands of categories.

3. **IWSLT14**: The International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation dataset, which is commonly used for evaluating machine translation systems.

4. **WMT17**: The Conference on Machine Translation dataset, which is another benchmark for machine translation tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015. DOI: 10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

- For **IWSLT14**, the citation is:
  > Cettolo, M., Girardi, C., & Federico, M. *WIT3: Web Inventory of Transcribed and Translated Talks*. In Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, 2017.

- For **WMT17**, the citation is:
  > Bojar, O., et al. *Findings of the 2017 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT17)*. In Proceedings of the Second Conference on Machine Translation, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
