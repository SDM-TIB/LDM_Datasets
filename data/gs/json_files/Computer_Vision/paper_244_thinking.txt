To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning with Increasing Object Shape Bias" by Zhibo Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of supervised learning due to the lack of large-scale annotated data, which suggests that the authors may reference datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to find explicit mentions of datasets. I will look for any dataset names or descriptions that indicate the data used for training or evaluation. If the authors mention using datasets like ImageNet or Webvision, I will note these down.

In the **experiments section**, I will also check for any specific details about how these datasets were utilized, such as the number of images, types of annotations, or any preprocessing steps that were applied. This information is crucial for understanding the context in which the datasets were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is critical, as I need to provide accurate and complete citations for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention using the **ImageNet dataset**, I will look for its citation, which typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year. Similarly, if they reference **Webvision**, I will find its corresponding citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
