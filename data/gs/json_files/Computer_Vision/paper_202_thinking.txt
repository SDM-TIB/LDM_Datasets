To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multistage Model for Robust Face Alignment Using Deep Neural Networks" by Huabin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that "extensive experiments based on challenging benchmark datasets are performed," which indicates that datasets are used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **300-W Dataset**: This dataset is described as being created from four datasets (AFW, LFPW, HELEN, and IBUG) and contains 3148 images annotated with 68 landmarks. The test set is divided into common, challenge, and full sets.

2. **300-W Private Test Set**: This set was introduced for the 300-W Challenge benchmark and consists of 600 images (300 indoor and 300 outdoor), each annotated with 68 landmarks.

3. **COFW Dataset**: The COFW dataset focuses on occlusion and contains 1345 training images and 507 testing images, each annotated with 29 landmarks.

4. **WFLW Dataset**: This dataset includes 10,000 faces (7500 for training and 2500 for testing) with 98 fully annotated landmarks and various attribute annotations.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **300-W Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Sagonas, G. Tzimiropoulos, S. Zafeiriou, and M. Pantic. *300 faces in-the-wild challenge: The first facial landmark localization challenge*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, 2013, pp. 397–403.

- For the **300-W Private Test Set**, the citation is:
  > C. Sagonas, E. Antonakos, G. Tzimiropoulos, S. Zafeiriou, and M. Pantic. *300 faces in-the-wild challenge: Database and results*. Image and Vision Computing, vol. 47, pp. 3–18, 2016.

- For the **COFW Dataset**, the citation is:
  > X. P. Burgos-Artizzu, P. Perona, and P. Dollar. *Robust face landmark estimation under occlusion*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2013, pp. 1513–1520.

- For the **WFLW Dataset**, the citation is:
  > W. Wu, C. Qian, S. Yang, Q. Wang, Y. Cai, and Q. Zhou. *Look at boundary: A boundary-aware face alignment algorithm*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2018, pp. 2129–2138.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
