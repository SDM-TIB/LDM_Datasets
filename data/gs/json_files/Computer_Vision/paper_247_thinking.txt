To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Error correction and extraction in request dialogs" by Stefan Constantin and Alex Waibel, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset** for evaluating their proposed dialog system utility component. This indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset they modified. They explain that their dataset is based on the annotations from the **EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset**, which comprises 100 hours of recordings of actions in a kitchen environment. This section provides specific details about the dataset, including the number of annotations and the criteria for selecting them.

The authors mention that they used the **EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset** to generate their own dataset for training and evaluation purposes. They describe how they modified the dataset to create training and validation sets with specific characteristics, such as balancing verb classes and generating synthetic corrections.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the **EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset** in the **References section**. The citation is as follows:
> Dima Damen, Hazel Doughty, Giovanni Maria Farinella, Sanja Fidler, Antonino Furnari, Evangelos Kazakos, Davide Moltisanti, Jonathan Munro, Toby Perrett, Will Price, and Michael Wray. *The EPIC-KITCHENS dataset: Collection, challenges and baselines*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 2020.

Additionally, the authors reference a follow-up paper for updates on the dataset:
> Dima Damen, Hazel Doughty, Giovanni Maria Farinella, Antonino Furnari, Evangelos Kazakos, Jian Ma, Davide Moltisanti, Jonathan Munro, Toby Perrett, Will Price, and Michael Wray. *Rescaling egocentric vision: Collection, pipeline and challenges for EPIC-KITCHENS-100*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2022.

In summary, I have identified the primary dataset used in the research and its modifications. I will now compile the dataset information, including the full citations, into a structured format for further processing.
