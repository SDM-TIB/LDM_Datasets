To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension" by Mike Lewis et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that BART achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks, which suggests that it has been evaluated on specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Comparing Pre-training Objectives)** and **section 5 (Large-scale Pre-training Experiments)**, as these sections typically contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In section 4.2, the authors explicitly mention several datasets:

1. **SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)**: This dataset is used for extractive question answering tasks. The authors reference the original paper for SQuAD, which provides the necessary citation.

2. **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is used for natural language inference tasks, and the authors also provide a citation for the original work.

3. **ELI5**: This dataset is mentioned for long-form question answering, and the authors cite the relevant paper that introduced this dataset.

4. **XSum (Extreme Summarization)**: This dataset is used for summarization tasks, and the authors provide a citation for the original work.

5. **ConvAI2**: This dataset is used for dialogue response generation, and the authors cite the relevant paper.

6. **CNN/DM (CNN/Daily Mail)**: This dataset is used for summarization tasks, and the authors provide a citation for the original work.

In the **References section**, I will locate the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.05250, 2016.

- For **MNLI**, the citation is:
  > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel R. Bowman. *A Broad-Coverage Challenge Corpus for Sentence Understanding through Inference*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.05426, 2017.

- For **ELI5**, the citation is:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
