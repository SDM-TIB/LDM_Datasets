To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probabilistic Spatial Transformer Networks" by Pola Schwöbel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on "standard imaging benchmarks" and a "challenging real-world dataset," which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention several datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Rotated MNIST**: This dataset is derived from the standard MNIST dataset, where images are rotated, and the authors provide ground-truth transformations for the rotations applied. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the performance of their model in a controlled manner.

2. **FashionMNIST**: The authors mention using the FashionMNIST dataset, which is a dataset of clothing images, for a similar experiment where they apply random transformations to assess the model's performance.

3. **Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD)**: This dataset is used to evaluate the model's ability to detect and classify traffic signs. The authors specify that they selected a subset of images containing only one traffic sign for their experiments.

4. **UCR Time-Series Dataset**: The authors refer to the UCR dataset, which consists of multiple smaller datasets for time-series classification tasks. They mention using specific subsets of this dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:

- For **UCR Time-Series Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
