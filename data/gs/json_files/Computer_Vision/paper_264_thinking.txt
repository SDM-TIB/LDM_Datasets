To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Study of Spatial Attention Mechanisms in Deep Networks" by Xizhou Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets. The introduction may also reference datasets used in the experiments or related work.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their contents or characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments:

1. **Cityscapes Dataset**: This dataset is used for semantic segmentation tasks and contains 5,000 finely annotated images. The authors mention that evaluation is done on the 500 images of the validation set.

2. **COCO 2017 Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for object detection tasks, consisting of 118,000 images for training and 5,000 images for validation. The authors refer to standard mean Average Precision (mAP) scores for evaluation.

3. **WMT 2014 English-German Dataset**: This dataset is used for neural machine translation tasks, comprising approximately 4.5 million sentence pairs. The evaluation is conducted on the English-to-German newstest2014 set.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For the **Cityscapes Dataset**:
  > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In CVPR, 2016.

- For the **COCO 2017 Dataset**:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. DollÃ¡r, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In ECCV, 2014.

- For the **WMT 2014 English-German Dataset**:
  > D. Britz, A. Goldie, M.-T. Luong, and Q. Le. *Massive Exploration of Neural Machine Translation Architectures*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.03906, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective references from the research paper.
