To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoAssist: A Framework to Accelerate Training of Deep Neural Networks" by Jiong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed AutoAssist framework is evaluated on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 6), where the authors describe their experiments on image classification and machine translation tasks. Here, they mention specific datasets used for evaluation:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is used for handwritten digit classification. The authors report that AutoAssist improves test accuracy on this dataset.

2. **FashionMNIST Dataset**: This dataset is used for classifying fashion items. The authors also report improvements in accuracy with AutoAssist on this dataset.

3. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: Another dataset mentioned for image classification tasks, where the authors note that AutoAssist leads to better performance.

4. **Multi30K Dataset**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks, specifically for English-German image descriptions. The authors report that AutoAssist achieves higher BLEU scores on this dataset.

5. **WMT 2014 English-German Dataset**: This dataset is also used for machine translation tasks, and the authors mention that AutoAssist requires fewer tokens to reach certain BLEU scores compared to the baseline model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010.

- For the **FashionMNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For the **CIFAR10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

- For the **Multi30K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Elliott, S. Frank, K. Sima’an, and L. Specia. *Multi30k: Multilingual english-german image descriptions*. pages 70–74, 2016.

- For the **WMT 2014 English-German Dataset**, the citation is:
  > The WMT 2014 English-German translation task. *Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)*, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and completeness. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
