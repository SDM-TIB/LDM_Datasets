To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Music theme recognition using CNN and self-attention" by Manoj Sukhavasi and Sainath Adapa, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention using the **autotagging-moodtheme subset of the MTG-Jamendo dataset** for their experiments. This indicates that a specific dataset is being utilized, and I need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors refer to the **MTG-Jamendo dataset** multiple times, particularly in the introduction and the approach sections. They describe it as a dataset used for automatic music tagging, which is crucial for understanding the context of their work.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MTG-Jamendo dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **MTG-Jamendo dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dmitry Bogdanov, Minz Won, Philip Tovstogan, Alastair Porter, and Xavier Serra. *The MTG-Jamendo Dataset for Automatic Music Tagging*. In Machine Learning for Music Discovery Workshop, International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2019). Long Beach, CA, United States. http://hdl.handle.net/10230/42015.

Since the authors do not mention any other datasets in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MTG-Jamendo dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MTG-Jamendo dataset, ensuring that it is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
