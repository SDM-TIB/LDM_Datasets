To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Better Conversations by Modeling, Filtering, and Optimizing for Coherence and Diversity" by Xinnuo Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **OpenSubtitles corpus**, which suggests that this is a primary dataset used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset and Filtering)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **OST (OpenSubtitles)**: This dataset consists of 2 million training instances, along with 4,000 instances each for development and testing. It is selected randomly from the entire OpenSubtitles corpus, which contains dialogue context and corresponding responses.

2. **fOST (filtered OpenSubtitles)**: This dataset also contains the same number of instances as OST but is filtered to include only those with a coherence score of C(x, y) ≥ 0.68. This filtering aims to enhance the quality of the dialogues by ensuring they are more coherent and relevant.

In the same section, the authors provide coherence and diversity metrics for both datasets, which further confirms their significance in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citation for the OpenSubtitles corpus is:

- For **OpenSubtitles**:
  > Pierre Lison and Jörg Tiedemann. *OpenSubtitles2016: Extracting Large Parallel Corpora from Movie and TV Subtitles*. In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016), Portorož, Slovenia.

I will also note that the authors reference the work of Lison and Meena (2016) regarding automatic dialogue turn segmentation, which is relevant to the dataset preparation.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations.
