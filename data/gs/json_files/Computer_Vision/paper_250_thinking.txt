To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identity-preserving Face Recovery from Portraits" by Fatemeh Shiri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a **large-scale synthesized dataset of real and stylized face pairs**, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Synthesized Dataset and Preprocessing)**, where the authors detail how they generated their dataset. They mention using the **CelebA dataset** to create pairs of stylized and real face images. This section provides crucial information about the dataset used for training and testing.

In this section, the authors state that they randomly selected **10,000 aligned real faces from the CelebA dataset for training** and **1,000 images for testing**. They describe the preprocessing steps taken to create the stylized face images, which include applying affine transformations to generate unaligned faces. They also mention synthesizing a total of **30,000 stylized/real face pairs** for training and **8,000 stylized images from eight diverse styles** for testing.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the **CelebA dataset** in the **References section**. The citation for the CelebA dataset is:
> Z. Liu, P. Luo, X. Wang, and X. Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In ICCV, 2015.

Additionally, the authors mention that their synthesized dataset will be available online, which is important for future reference.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
