To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TeamDL at SemEval-2018 Task 8: Cybersecurity Text Analysis using Convolutional Neural Network and Conditional Random Fields" by Krishna Madgula et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in SemEval-2018 Task 8, which involves text classification and token label prediction in the cybersecurity domain. This suggests that there may be specific datasets used for these tasks.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Dataset and Preprocessing)**, where the authors describe the datasets used. They mention the **MalwareTextDB corpus**, which is crucial for their work. The paper states that this corpus consists of APT reports describing malware-related information taken from APTnotes. This is a clear identification of the dataset being utilized.

I will also look for any additional details about the dataset, such as its structure, size, or specific characteristics, which may be mentioned in this section. The authors do not provide extensive details about the dataset's size or the number of entries, but they do mention that the dataset was split into different subsets for training and testing purposes (train17, test-17, dev-18, test-18).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MalwareTextDB dataset. The authors reference Lim et al. (2017) for this dataset, which is essential for proper citation.

The citation for the MalwareTextDB dataset is:
> Swee Kiat Lim, Aldrian Obaja Muis, Wei Lu, and Ong Chen Hui. *Malwaretextdb: A database for annotated malware articles*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 1â€“6, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
