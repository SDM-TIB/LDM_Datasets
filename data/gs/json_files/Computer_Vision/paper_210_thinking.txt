To extract datasets from the research paper titled "R-Transformer: Recurrent Neural Network Enhanced Transformer" by Zhiwei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the R-Transformer is evaluated through extensive experiments with data from various domains, which suggests that multiple datasets are used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. Here, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

In **subsection 4.1 (Pixel-by-Pixel MNIST)**, the authors describe the use of the **MNIST dataset** for a classification task. They mention that the dataset consists of images of handwritten digits, which are rescaled into sequences for the model to classify. I will note down the details provided about the dataset.

In **subsection 4.2 (Nottingham: Polyphonic Music Modeling)**, the authors refer to the **Nottingham dataset**, which is used for evaluating the model's ability in polyphonic music modeling. They provide information about the dataset's composition and how it is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

In **subsection 4.3 (PennTreebank: Language Modeling)**, the authors mention the **Penn Treebank (PTB)** dataset, which is used for both character-level and word-level language modeling tasks. They provide details about the dataset's size and how it is split for training and testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, Patrick Haffner, et al. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. **Nottingham Dataset**:
   > Nicolas Boulanger-Lewandowski, Yoshua Bengio, and Pascal Vincent. *Modeling temporal dependencies in high-dimensional sequences: Application to polyphonic music generation and transcription*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1206.6392, 2012.

3. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**:
   > Mitchell Marcus, Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. 1993.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **MNIST Dataset**: Used for pixel-by-pixel classification of handwritten digits.
- **Nottingham Dataset**: Used for polyphonic music modeling, containing British and American folk tunes.
- **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: Used for language modeling tasks, containing a large annotated corpus of English.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
