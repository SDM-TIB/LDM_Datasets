To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoToon: Automatic Geometric Warping for Face Cartoon Generation" by Julia Gong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The introduction highlights the need for a dataset to train their model, which suggests that a specific dataset is likely introduced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset they created for their experiments. Here, they mention the **AutoToon dataset**, which consists of paired images of human facial portraits and their corresponding artist-generated cartoons. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the number of images, the demographics of the subjects, and the process used to create the warped images.

The authors state that the dataset includes **101 portrait images** collected from Flickr, which were warped by two caricature artists. They also mention how the dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets, which is important for understanding its structure.

After gathering this information, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the AutoToon dataset is introduced in this paper, I will note that the citation for it is the paper itself:

- For the **AutoToon dataset**, the citation is:
  > Julia Gong, Yannick Hold-Geoffroy, and Jingwan Lu. *AutoToon: Automatic Geometric Warping for Face Cartoon Generation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that I include all necessary details about the dataset, such as its purpose, the number of images, and how it was created.

Finally, I will compile this information into a clear and concise format that can be used for further processing or review.
