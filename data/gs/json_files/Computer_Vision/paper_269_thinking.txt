To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Contextual Representations for Suicide Risk Assessment from Internet Forums" by Ashwin Karthik Ambalavanan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions the use of data from Reddit forums, which suggests that there may be a specific dataset involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the **University of Maryland Reddit Suicidality Dataset**, which is crucial for understanding the context of their research. This dataset is derived from Reddit posts and is used to assess suicidality risk, indicating that it is a key component of their study.

Next, I will look for more details about this dataset in the **methods section**. The authors describe how the dataset was constructed from the 2015 Full Reddit Submission Corpus, specifically focusing on the r/SuicideWatch subreddit. They provide information about the structure of the data, including post IDs, user IDs, timestamps, subreddit names, post titles, and post bodies. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance and importance.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss their performance on various tasks using this dataset, which further emphasizes its significance in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the University of Maryland Reddit Suicidality Dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **University of Maryland Reddit Suicidality Dataset**:
  > Zirikly, A., Resnik, P., Uzuner, Ö., & Hollingshead, K. (2019). CLPsych 2019 Shared Task: Predicting the Degree of Suicide Risk in Reddit Posts. In Proceedings of the Sixth Workshop on Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology: From Keyboard to Clinic (pp. 172–176). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, I have identified the **University of Maryland Reddit Suicidality Dataset** as the primary dataset used in this research, and I have retrieved its full citation. I will now prepare to present this information in the required format.
