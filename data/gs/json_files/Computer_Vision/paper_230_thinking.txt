To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identity-preserving Face Recovery from Stylized Portraits" by Fatemeh Shiri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted evaluations on a "large-scale synthesized dataset" and a "hand-drawn sketch dataset," which suggests that these datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In this case, **section 4 (Synthesized Dataset and Preprocessing)** provides a comprehensive description of the datasets. Here, the authors mention that they used the **CelebA dataset** for training and testing. They specify that they randomly selected 110K faces for training and 2K for testing, which is important information for understanding the dataset's scope.

The paper also discusses the creation of a synthesized dataset of stylized face (SF) and real face (RF) pairs. They mention using three distinct styles (Scream, Candy, and Mosaic) for synthesizing training data, which is relevant for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

To ensure I have the full citations for the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the **CelebA dataset** is as follows:
- Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

Additionally, the authors mention that their synthesized dataset and code will be available on GitHub and a Wikidot page, which is useful for anyone looking to access the datasets directly.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:
1. **CelebA Dataset**: A large-scale dataset containing 200K celebrity images with 40 attribute annotations, used for training and testing.
   - Citation: Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

2. **Synthesized Dataset**: Created by pairing stylized face images with their corresponding photorealistic counterparts, using three distinct artistic styles (Scream, Candy, Mosaic).
   - Citation: Not explicitly cited as a standalone dataset, but based on the CelebA dataset.

3. **Hand-drawn Sketch Dataset**: Used for testing the method's ability to recover faces from sketches, although specific details or citations for this dataset are not provided in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
