To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NAT: Neural Architecture Transformer for Accurate and Compact Architectures" by Yong Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that they conducted extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets: **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research and should be included in my extraction.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments** section. In this section, the authors confirm that they applied their method to both **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet**, providing additional context about their use in the experiments. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources of the datasets.

1. For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, 2009.

2. For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will include the dataset names, their descriptions, and the full citations as extracted from the paper. 

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any subsequent processing or review.
