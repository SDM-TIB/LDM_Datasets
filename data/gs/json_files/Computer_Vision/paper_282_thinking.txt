To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AriEL: Volume Coding for Sentence Generation" by Luca Celotti, Simon Brodeur, and Jean Rouat, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and datasets sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions benchmarking on a "toy grammar" and a "real dataset of human dialogues," indicating that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss their approach and the datasets used. They mention a "toy dataset of sentences generated from a context-free grammar" and the "GuessWhat?! dataset," which suggests that these are the two datasets they utilized for their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, specifically section 3.3, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets:

1. **Toy Dataset**: This dataset consists of sentences generated from a context-free grammar (CFG). The authors specify that it includes 1 million biased training sentences, 10,000 test sentences, and 512 validation sentences, with a vocabulary of 840 words.

2. **GuessWhat?! Dataset**: This dataset is described as a collection of sentences asked by humans during a cooperative game. It features a vocabulary of 10,469 words, with a maximum sentence length of 57 symbols and a mean length of 5.9 symbols.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets, but I can summarize the information based on the descriptions provided in the text.

- For the **Toy Dataset**, since it is generated by the authors using a context-free grammar, it does not have a formal citation but can be described as:
  > Celotti, L., Brodeur, S., & Rouat, J. (2023). *Toy dataset generated from a context-free grammar for sentence generation experiments*.

- For the **GuessWhat?! Dataset**, the citation is:
  > De Vries, H., Strub, F., Chandar, O., Pietquin, O., Larochelle, H., & Courville, A. C. (2017). *Guesswhat?! Visual object discovery through multi-modal dialogue*. In IEEE CPVR, vol. 1, no. 2.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key details and citations for each dataset. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.
