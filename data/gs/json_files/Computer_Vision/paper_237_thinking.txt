To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Transformer Networks for Semantic Correspondence" by Seungryong Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks for semantic correspondence, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 5) where the authors discuss the benchmarks used to evaluate their method. In this section, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **TSS Benchmark**: This dataset consists of 400 image pairs divided into three groups: FG3DCar, JODS, and PASCAL. The authors evaluate their method's performance on this benchmark and provide details about the evaluation metrics used.

2. **PF-WILLOW Benchmark**: This dataset includes 10 object sub-classes with 10 keypoint annotations for each image. The authors report the probability of correct keypoint (PCK) as the evaluation metric.

3. **PF-PASCAL Benchmark**: This dataset contains 1,351 image pairs over 20 object categories with PASCAL keypoint annotations. The authors also provide details on how they split the dataset for training, validation, and testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for are:

- For the **TSS Benchmark**, I will find the original paper that introduced this dataset.
- For the **PF-WILLOW Benchmark**, I will locate the corresponding reference that describes this dataset.
- For the **PF-PASCAL Benchmark**, I will also find the original source that details this dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the structured output for these datasets, ready for further processing or review.
