To extract datasets from the research paper titled "All-in-One Image-Grounded Conversational Agents" by Da Ju et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the goal of creating a conversational agent that combines vision and language, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Tasks)**, where the authors detail various language and vision tasks. Here, they mention several datasets used for training and evaluation. I will take note of each dataset mentioned, including any specific details provided about their size or characteristics.

In **subsection 2.1 (Language-based)**, the authors mention two datasets:
1. **Wikipedia and Toronto Books**: This dataset consists of 150 million (context, response) pairs.
2. **pushshift.io Reddit**: This dataset contains 174 million (context, response) pairs.

In **subsection 2.2 (Vision-based)**, the authors list several image datasets:
1. **ImageNet**: Contains 1.28 million images.
2. **Instagram images**: Comprises 3.5 billion images.
3. **Visual Genome**: Contains 108,077 images with 2.8 million attributes.

In **subsection 2.3 (Vision + Language)**, the authors describe several combined tasks and their corresponding datasets:
1. **COCO Captions**: About 83k training images and 414k captions.
2. **Flickr30k**: Contains 29k training images and 145k captions.
3. **Personality Captions**: Approximately 187k training images with conversational style labels.
4. **Image Chat**: An extension of Personality Captions with 356k conversation turns based on the same 187k images.
5. **Image Chat QA**: Extracts about 20k question-answer pairs from the Image Chat dataset.
6. **Image-Grounded Conversations (IGC)**: Contains validation and test portions but no training set.
7. **Visual Question Answering (VQA)**: Contains 83k training images and 444k QA pairs.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. Here are the citations I will extract:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations into a structured format for further processing.
