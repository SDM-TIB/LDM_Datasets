To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer-Transducer: End-to-End Speech Recognition with Self-Attention" by Ching-Feng Yeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that all experiments are conducted on the **LibriSpeech corpus**, which indicates that this is a dataset used in their research. The introduction may provide additional context or mention other datasets, so I will read through it carefully.

Next, I will look at the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. In section 5.1, they explicitly state that they used the **LibriSpeech corpus** for their experiments, detailing that it contains 960 hours of read speech data and various subsets for evaluation. This confirms that the LibriSpeech corpus is the primary dataset used in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LibriSpeech corpus. The citation provided in the references is:
> Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: An ASR Corpus Based on Public Domain Audio Books*. In Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the only dataset extracted from this paper is the **LibriSpeech corpus**.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that all necessary information is captured accurately and is ready for review or downstream applications.
