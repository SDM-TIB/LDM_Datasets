To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying Semantically Duplicate Questions Using Data Science Approach: A Quora Case Study" by Navedanjum Ansari and Rajesh Sharma, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied various machine learning and deep learning techniques on a dataset related to Quora's question pairs, which suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the data for their research is taken from the **First Quora Dataset release**, which is hosted on Amazon S3. They specify that this dataset contains **404,290 question pairs** and provides a brief overview of its structure.

In this section, the authors also describe the dataset's characteristics, including the columns present, such as `id`, `qid1`, `qid2`, `question1`, `question2`, and `is_duplicate`. This information is crucial for understanding how the dataset is organized and what it contains.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- **First Quora Dataset Release**: 
  > Quora. *First Quora Dataset Release: Question Pairs*. Available at: http://qim.fs.quoracdn.net/quora_duplicate_questions.tsv

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as it is essential for proper attribution.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for inclusion in the final output, ensuring that it is clear and accurately reflects the information extracted from the paper.
