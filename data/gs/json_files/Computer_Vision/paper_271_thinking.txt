To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Learning of General Transformations for Data Augmentation" by Saypraseuth Mounsaveng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of data augmentation and mention that they tested their approach on several well-known datasets. This indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten grayscale digits, containing 70,000 samples (60,000 training and 10,000 test samples). They also refer to a reduced dataset of 550 samples.
   
2. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset, consisting of 73,257 training samples and 26,032 test samples, with a reduced dataset of 1,000 training samples used in their experiments.

3. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 color images across 10 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. They mention using a subset of 4,000 training samples for their experiments.

4. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset of grayscale images of fashion articles, also containing 70,000 samples (60,000 training and 10,000 test samples), with a reduced dataset of 550 samples used in their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **MNIST**:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **SVHN**:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, 2011.

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
