To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KDEHatEval at SemEval-2019 Task 5: A Neural Network Model for Detecting Hate Speech in Twitter" by Umme Aymun Siddiqua et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the team's approach to detecting hate speech in tweets defined in the SemEval-2019 Task 5, which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the SemEval-2019 Task 5 and mention that it focuses on hate speech detection in tweets, specifically targeting immigrants and women. This indicates that there is a dataset associated with this task.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments and Evaluations)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset Collection)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that they utilized the English dataset from the HatEval task, which contains 9,000 training tweets, 1,000 validation tweets, and 2,971 test tweets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the HatEval dataset is:

- For the **HatEval dataset**, the citation is:
  > Valerio Basile, Cristina Bosco, Elisabetta Fersini, Debora Nozza, Viviana Patti, Francisco Rangel, Paolo Rosso, and Manuela Sanguinetti. *SemEval-2019 Task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in Twitter*. In Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), pages 365â€“370, 2019. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the required structure.

In conclusion, I have identified the dataset used in the paper, confirmed its details, and retrieved the full citation necessary for proper referencing.
