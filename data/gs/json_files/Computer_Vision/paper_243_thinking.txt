To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HCTI at SemEval-2017 Task 1: Use convolutional neural network to evaluate Semantic Textual Similarity" by Yang Shao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the system and its performance but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task and mentions that it has been evaluated in various SemEval competitions from 2012 to 2017. This indicates that datasets from these competitions may be relevant, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**. Here, the author states that they used datasets from SemEval-2012 to SemEval-2015 and tested their model on the English dataset of SemEval-2016. This gives me the names of the datasets used for training and testing.

I will now look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:

1. For the SemEval-2012 dataset:
   > Eneko Agirre, Mona Diab, Daniel Cer, and Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre. *Semeval-2012 task 6: A pilot on semantic textual similarity*. In Proceedings of the First Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics, pages 385–393, 2012.

2. For the SemEval-2013 dataset:
   > Eneko Agirre, Carmen Banea, Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre, and Rada Mihalcea. *Sem 2013 shared task: Semantic textual similarity*. In Proceedings of the Main Conference and the Shared Task: Semantic Textual Similarity, pages 32–43, 2013.

3. For the SemEval-2014 dataset:
   > Eneko Agirre, Carmen Banea, Claire Cardie, Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre, Rada Mihalcea, German Rigau, and Janyce Wiebe. *Semeval-2014 task 10: Multilingual semantic textual similarity*.

4. For the SemEval-2016 dataset:
   > Eneko Agirre, Mona Diab, Daniel Cer, Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre, and Weiwei Guo. *Semeval-2016 task 1: Semantic textual similarity, monolingual and cross-lingual evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pages 497–511, 2016.

5. For the STS benchmark dataset:
   > Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Eneko Agirre, Inigo Lopez-Gazpio, and Lucia Specia. *Semeval-2017 task 1: Semantic textual similarity multilingual and crosslingual focused evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluations (SemEval-2017), pages 1–14, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and reference.
