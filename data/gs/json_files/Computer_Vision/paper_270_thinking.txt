To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-Memory Neural Network Training: A Technical Report" by Nimit S. Sohoni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating techniques on two deep learning benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training and 10,000 test datapoints, with inputs being 32 x 32 RGB images across 10 classes. The authors reference the original work by Krizhevsky (2009) for this dataset.

2. **IWSLT’14 German to English Translation Task**: This dataset consists of 160,000 sentence pairs used for training. The authors cite the work by Cettolo et al. (2014) for this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report.

- For **IWSLT’14**, the citation is:
  > Cettolo, M., Niehues, J., Stüker, S., Bentivogli, L., & Federico, M. (2014). *Report on the 11th IWSLT evaluation campaign*. In International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT).

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I accurately document each dataset with its respective citation, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for downstream processing or review.
