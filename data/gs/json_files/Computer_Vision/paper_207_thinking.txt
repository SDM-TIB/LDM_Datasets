To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probing the phonetic and phonological knowledge of tones in Mandarin TTS models" by Jian Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that controlled stimuli were used for testing tonal coarticulation and tone sandhi in Mandarin, which suggests that there are specific datasets or stimuli involved in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the **stimuli** subsections (3.1.1 and 3.1.2), where the author describes the controlled stimuli used for the experiments. In section 3.1.1, the author mentions that the stimuli for tonal coarticulation consist of all possible bisyllabic combinations of syllables [ma, mo, mi] with different tones embedded in 6 carrier phrases, resulting in 576 sentences. This indicates a dataset created specifically for this experiment.

In section 3.1.2, the author discusses the stimuli for the Tone-3 sandhi experiment, which includes 38 bisyllabic words, 32 trisyllabic words, and 39 phrases, all of which were in Tone-3. This also constitutes a dataset used for the study.

I will then look for any references to external datasets in the **experiments section** or **acknowledgments** that might provide additional context or citations for the datasets used. However, the primary datasets appear to be the controlled stimuli created for the experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Chinese Standard Mandarin Speech Corpus (CSMSC)**: This dataset is referenced in section 4.1 as the training data for both Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow models. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Data BAKER. *Chinese Standard Mandarin Speech Corpus (CSMSC)*. Available at: https://www.data-baker.com/open_source.html.

2. **Controlled Stimuli for Tonal Coarticulation**: This dataset is created specifically for the study and does not have a formal citation since it is original research. I will note it as:
   > Controlled stimuli for tonal coarticulation: 576 sentences created from bisyllabic combinations of [ma, mo, mi] with different tones.

3. **Controlled Stimuli for Tone-3 Sandhi**: Similar to the previous dataset, this is also original research and does not have a formal citation. I will note it as:
   > Controlled stimuli for Tone-3 sandhi: 38 bisyllabic words, 32 trisyllabic words, and 39 phrases, all in Tone-3.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation or description, ready for further processing or review.
