To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cycle Text-to-Image GAN with BERT" by Trevor Tsue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for experiments. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the text-to-image generation task and its applications, but they do not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **methods section**, particularly **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments.

In section 3, the authors state that they used the **2011 Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset (CUB-200)**, which contains 11,788 images of 200 different types of birds. This dataset is widely recognized as a benchmark for text-to-image generation tasks. They also mention that they have 10 text descriptions downloaded from a GitHub repository that serve as the text descriptions for the generated images.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CUB-200 dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For the **Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset (CUB-200)**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology.

Since the authors do not provide a specific citation for the 10 text descriptions, I will note that they were sourced from a GitHub repository, but I will not include a citation for them as it is not explicitly provided in the paper.

Now, I will summarize the findings for the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring to include the full citation for the CUB-200 dataset.

After compiling this information, I will be ready to present the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
