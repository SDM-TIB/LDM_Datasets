To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Batch Optimization for Deep Learning: Training BERT in 76 Minutes" by Yang You et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved significant speed improvements in training BERT using their proposed optimizer, LAMB, but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of training large models and references existing datasets but does not name them yet.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In **Section 4.1 (BERT Training)**, the authors mention using the **Wikipedia** and **BooksCorpus** datasets for training BERT. They specify that the Wikipedia dataset contains 2.5 billion words and the BooksCorpus contains 800 million words. This is a clear indication of the datasets used for their experiments.

In **Section 4.2 (ImageNet Training with ResNet-50)**, the authors refer to the **ImageNet** dataset, which is a standard benchmark for image classification tasks. They mention that their experiments with the ResNet-50 architecture achieved a top-1 accuracy of 76.4% on this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Wikipedia dataset**, the citation is:
   > "Wikipedia contributors. (2021). Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page"

2. For the **BooksCorpus dataset**, the citation is:
   > Zhu, Y., Yang, Z., Zhang, S., & Wang, C. (2015). *Aligning Books and Movies: Towards Story-like Visual Explanations by Watching Movies and Reading Books*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.06724.

3. For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
