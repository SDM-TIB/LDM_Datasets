To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeSTNet: Densely Fused Spatial Transformer Networks" by Annunziata, Sagonas, and Calì, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three benchmarks: **MNIST, GTSRB, and IDocDB**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4, the authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, with a training set of 60,000 and a test set of 10,000 grayscale images, each of size 28 × 28 pixels.

2. **GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)**: This dataset includes 39,209 training and 12,630 test color images from 43 different traffic signs, taken under various real-world conditions.

3. **IDocDB**: This is a non-public dataset of official identity documents, containing 1,000 training and 500 testing color images collected under in-the-wild conditions. The images vary significantly in size and include real perspective transformations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

- For the **GTSRB dataset**, the citation is:
  > Johannes Stallkamp, Marc Schlipsing, Jan Salmen, and Christian Igel. *The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark: A Multi-Class Classification Competition*. In Proceedings of International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), pages 1453–1460, 2011.

- The **IDocDB** dataset does not have a specific citation in the references, as it is mentioned as a non-public dataset. However, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset used in the study.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for MNIST and GTSRB, while noting the proprietary nature of IDocDB. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
