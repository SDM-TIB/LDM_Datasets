To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep-COVID: Predicting COVID-19 From Chest X-Ray Images Using Deep Transfer Learning" by Shervin Minaee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors prepared a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays, which suggests that this dataset is significant for the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (COVID-Xray-5k Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They mention that the COVID-Xray-5k dataset is composed of images from two sources:

1. **COVID-ChestXray-Dataset**: This dataset contains 250 X-ray images of COVID-19 patients, collected by Joseph Paul Cohen. The authors specify that they used only the anterior-posterior images, resulting in 184 images being retained for their study.

2. **ChexPert Dataset**: This is a large public dataset consisting of 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients, labeled for the presence of 14 sub-categories. The authors used images from the "no-finding" category and other sub-categories to create a balanced dataset for training and testing.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilized the COVID-Xray-5k dataset for their model training and evaluation, which reinforces the importance of this dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**:

- For the **COVID-ChestXray-Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cohen, Joseph Paul, Paul Morrison, and Lan Dao. "COVID-19 image data collection." arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.11597, 2020.

- For the **ChexPert Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Irvin, Jeremy, Pranav Rajpurkar, Michael Ko, Yifan Yu, Silviana Ciurea-Ilcus, Chris Chute, Henrik Marklund et al. "Chexpert: A large chest radiograph dataset with uncertainty labels and expert comparison." In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, vol. 33, pp. 590-597. 2019.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
