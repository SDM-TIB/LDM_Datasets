To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STNReID: Deep Convolutional Networks with Pairwise Spatial Transformer Networks for Partial Person Re-identification" by Hao Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two partial ReID datasets, which suggests that specific datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental settings section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they describe:

1. **Market1501 Dataset**: This is a holistic person ReID dataset that includes 32,668 images of 1,501 person IDs, with a training set consisting of 12,936 images of 751 identities.

2. **Partial-ReID Dataset**: This dataset consists of 600 images of 60 persons, with each person represented by 5 full-body images and 5 partial images. The images were collected in various conditions, including different viewpoints and severe occlusions.

3. **Partial-iLIDS Dataset**: This is a simulated partial dataset based on the iLIDS dataset, containing 119 persons with 238 images captured by multiple non-overlapping cameras.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Market1501 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, L., Shen, L., Tian, L., Wang, S., Wang, J., & Tian, Q. (2015). *Scalable person re-identification: A benchmark*. In Computer Vision, IEEE International Conference.

- For the **Partial-ReID Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, W.-S., Li, X., Xiang, T., Liao, S., Lai, J., & Gong, S. (2015). *Partial person re-identification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision.

- For the **iLIDS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ristani, E., Solera, F., Zou, R., Cucchiara, R., & Tomasi, C. (2016). *Performance measures and a data set for multi-target, multi-camera tracking*. In European Conference on Computer Vision workshop on Benchmarking Multi-Target Tracking.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use.
