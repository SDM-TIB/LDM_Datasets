To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Regression Architecture with Two-Stage Re-initialization for High Performance Facial Landmark Detection" by Jiangjing Lv et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method achieves superior performance on two benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets are used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention two datasets:

1. **300-W Dataset**: This dataset consists of re-annotated images from five existing datasets with 68 landmarks. The authors specify that they used 3,148 images for training and 689 images for testing, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's structure.

2. **AFLW Dataset**: This dataset contains 24,386 faces with a variety of appearances and provides up to 21 landmarks for each face. The authors mention using a training set of 20,000 images and a test set of 4,386 images, which is also important for dataset characterization.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **300-W Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Sagonas, G. Tzimiropoulos, S. Zafeiriou, and M. Pantic. *300 faces in-the-wild challenge: The first facial landmark localization challenge*. In Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, 2013.

- For the **AFLW Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Koestinger, P. Wohlhart, P. M. Roth, and H. Bischof. *Annotated facial landmarks in the wild: A large-scale, real-world database for facial landmark localization*. In Proceedings of IEEE International Workshop on Benchmarking Facial Image Analysis Technologies, 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited.
