To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simple, Distributed, and Accelerated Probabilistic Programming" by Dustin Tran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention applications of their approach to a **model-parallel variational auto-encoder (VAE) on 64x64 ImageNet** and an **Image Transformer on 256x256 CelebA-HQ**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) in detail. Here, the authors provide specific information about the datasets used for their evaluations:

1. **ImageNet Dataset**: The authors refer to a **64x64 ImageNet** dataset, which is used for training a vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VAE). This dataset is known for its extensive collection of images across various categories.

2. **CelebA-HQ Dataset**: The authors also mention the **256x256 CelebA-HQ** dataset, which is utilized for training the Image Transformer model. This dataset is well-known for its high-quality images of celebrity faces and is commonly used in image generation tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **ImageNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

- For the **CelebA-HQ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, and Jaakko Lehtinen. *Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **ImageNet Dataset** - Citation: Olga Russakovsky et al. (2015).
2. **CelebA-HQ Dataset** - Citation: Tero Karras et al. (2018).

This process ensures that I have accurately identified and documented the datasets used in the research, along with their proper citations for reference.
