To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InterBERT: Vision-and-Language Interaction for Multi-modal Pretraining" by Junyang Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions a "large-scale dataset for multi-modal pretraining in Chinese," which indicates that there is at least one dataset to look for.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 3 (Experiments)** and **section 4 (Related Work)**. In section 3, the authors provide details about the datasets used for pretraining and downstream tasks.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Conceptual Caption (CC)**: This dataset consists of 3.3 million image-text pairs used for pretraining. It is designed to provide a large-scale dataset for image captioning tasks.

2. **SBU Captions**: This dataset contains 890,000 image-text pairs and is also used for pretraining. It is known for its diverse set of captions.

3. **COCO Captions**: This dataset includes 587,000 image-text pairs (with 117,000 images) and is widely used in image captioning and visual recognition tasks.

4. **Flickr30K**: This dataset is used for downstream tasks and contains 29,000 images paired with 145,000 captions for training, along with validation and test sets.

5. **Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR)**: This dataset is used for evaluating the model's performance on reasoning tasks and contains 80,000 images and 213,000 questions.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
