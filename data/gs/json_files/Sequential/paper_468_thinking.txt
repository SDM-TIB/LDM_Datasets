To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "NLP@UNED at SMM4H 2019: Neural Networks Applied to Automatic Classifications of Adverse Effects Mentions in Tweets" by Javier Cortes-Tejada et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the system developed for classifying adverse effects in tweets, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for the task. They mention that the dataset is publicly available and contains 24,606 tweets, with specific annotations for adverse drug reactions (ADRs). This section provides essential details about the dataset, including the number of tweets and the binary annotation indicating the presence or absence of ADRs.

I will also note the preprocessing steps mentioned in **section 2.1 (Pre-processing)**, as they provide context on how the dataset was prepared for analysis. However, the primary focus will remain on identifying the dataset itself.

Since the paper does not provide a specific name for the dataset beyond describing it as a collection of tweets, I will need to refer to the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. The authors reference the shared task organized by Weissenbacher et al. (2019), which is crucial for citing the dataset correctly.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Davy Weissenbacher, Abeed Sarker, Arjun Magge, Ashlynn Daughton, Karen Oâ€™Connor, Michael Paul, and Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez. *Overview of the fourth Social Media Mining for Health (SMM4H) shared task at ACL 2019*. In Proceedings of the 2019 ACL Workshop SMM4H: The 4th Social Media Mining for Health Applications Workshop Shared Task.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. The dataset is primarily focused on tweets related to adverse drug reactions, and the citation will be crucial for anyone looking to reference the dataset in future work.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for structured output, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
