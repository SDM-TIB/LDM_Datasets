To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Role Labeling with Pretrained Language Models for Known and Unknown Predicates" by Daniil Larionov et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **FrameBank corpus**, which is a semantically annotated corpus for training models. This is a strong indication that I need to gather more information about this dataset.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **FrameBank corpus** in the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors describe the limitations of the FrameBank corpus, noting that it provides annotations for a limited set of predicates. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their research.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 4.1**, the authors provide details about the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the FrameBank corpus contains annotated text samples with multiple contextual sentences and that they filtered the dataset to retain only predicates with at least 10 examples. The final version of the corpus contains 52,751 examples for 44 unique semantic roles.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FrameBank corpus. The relevant citations are:

- For the FrameBank corpus, the citation is:
  > Olga Lyashevskaya and Egor Kashkin. *FrameBank: A Database of Russian Lexical Constructions*. In International Conference on Analysis of Images, Social Networks and Texts, pages 350â€“360, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the FrameBank corpus, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for review or further processing.
