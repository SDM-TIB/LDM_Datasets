To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection of Social Media Disclosures of Sexual Harassment" by Arijit Ghosh Chowdhury et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a "manually annotated real-world dataset" to test their technique, indicating that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the dataset. In this section, the authors describe the data collection process, stating that they collected **5,117 tweets** containing self-disclosures of sexual abuse from Twitter, specifically from November 2016 to December 2018. This is a clear indication of the dataset they created.

The authors also mention that the dataset was annotated by clinical psychologists and gender studies academics, which adds credibility to the dataset's quality. They specify that **1,126 tweets** were annotated as "Self-Disclosure," which is a key detail about the dataset's composition.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since this dataset is a product of the authors' own research, it may not have an external citation. Instead, I will note that the dataset is publicly available, as mentioned in the paper.

The relevant dataset information I will compile includes:

1. **Dataset Name**: Self-Disclosure of Sexual Harassment on Twitter
   - **Description**: A manually annotated dataset containing tweets that disclose personal experiences of sexual harassment. The dataset consists of 5,117 tweets, with 1,126 annotated as self-disclosure.
   - **Citation**: Ghosh Chowdhury, A., Sawhney, R., Mathur, P., Mahata, D., & Shah, R. R. (2019). Detection of Social Media Disclosures of Sexual Harassment. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Student Research Workshop, pages 136â€“146. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for datasets, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as specified.
