To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Compacted Sensing View of Unsupervised Text Embeddings, Bag-of-n-Grams, and LSTMs" by Sanjeev Arora et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of low-dimensional vector embeddings and mentions empirical results on standard benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention testing on several standard classification tasks, which likely indicates the presence of specific datasets.

Upon reviewing Section 6, I find that the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SST (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification tasks. The authors report performance metrics on both binary and fine-grained sentiment classification tasks.

2. **IMDB (Internet Movie Database)**: This dataset is also used for sentiment classification, and the authors provide performance results on this dataset as well.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**, the citation is:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J. Y., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2013). Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank. In Proceedings of Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

- For the **IMDB dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maas, A. L., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the ACL: Human Language Technologies.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)** - Citation: Socher et al. (2013)
2. **IMDB dataset** - Citation: Maas et al. (2011)

This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for proper attribution.
