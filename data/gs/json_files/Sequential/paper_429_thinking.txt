To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Semantic Parsers from Denotations with Latent Structured Alignments and Abstract Programs" by Bailin Wang, Ivan Titov, and Mirella Lapata, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they achieve state-of-the-art performance on **WIKITABLEQUESTIONS** and **WIKISQL** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors provide specific information about the datasets:

1. **WIKITABLEQUESTIONS**: This dataset contains 2,018 tables and 18,496 utterance-denotation pairs. It is noted for its complexity, as it covers a wide range of domains and involves various operations such as superlatives, comparisons, and aggregation.

2. **WIKISQL**: This dataset consists of 24,241 tables and 80,654 utterance-denotation pairs. The questions in this dataset are described as logically simpler, focusing on aggregation, column selection, and conditions.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **WIKITABLEQUESTIONS**, the citation is:
  > Pasupat, P., & Liang, P. (2015). Compositional semantic parsing on semi-structured tables. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

- For **WIKISQL**, the citation is:
  > Zhong, V., Xiong, C., & Socher, R. (2017). Seq2sql: Generating structured queries from natural language using reinforcement learning. CoRR, abs/1709.00103.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets relevant to the research and their proper citations for any future references or applications.
