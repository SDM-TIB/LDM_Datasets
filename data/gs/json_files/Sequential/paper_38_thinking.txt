To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Alternative Weighting Schemes for ELMo Embeddings" by Nils Reimers and Iryna Gurevych, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of different methods for combining ELMo vectors, which suggests that various datasets may be involved in these evaluations.

Next, I will look into the **methodology and evaluation sections** of the paper, particularly focusing on the **Evaluation of Weighting Schemes** section. Here, the authors describe their experiments and the datasets used for testing the different weighting schemes. They mention several datasets explicitly, which I will need to note down.

From the text, I can identify the following datasets used in their experiments:

1. **Arguments Dataset**: This dataset is used for argument component detection in persuasive essays. The authors mention that it consists of 402 essays, with a development and test set of 80 randomly selected essays each.

2. **ACE Entities/Events Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the ACE 2005 dataset, which includes 599 annotated documents across various domains. The authors used 90 randomly selected documents for both development and test sets.

3. **POS Dataset**: This dataset uses part-of-speech tags from Universal Dependencies v. 1.3 for English, with a reduced training set of the first 500 sentences.

4. **Chunking Dataset**: This dataset is from the CoNLL 2000 shared task on chunking.

5. **NER Dataset**: This dataset is from the CoNLL 2003 shared task on named entity recognition.

6. **GENIA NER Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2000 annotated Medline abstracts for bio-entity recognition, with a development set of 400 abstracts and a test set of 404 abstracts.

7. **WNUT16 Dataset**: This dataset is from the WNUT16 shared task on Named Entity Recognition over Twitter, with training data of 2,394 annotated tweets, development data of 1,000 tweets, and test data of 3,856 tweets.

8. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-5)**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis.

9. **Penn TreeBank**: This dataset is used for constituency parsing.

10. **Stanford Natural Language Inference Corpus (SNLI)**: This dataset is used for natural language inference tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Here are the citations I will include:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
