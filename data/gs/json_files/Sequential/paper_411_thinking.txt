To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SWAP at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Emotion detection in conversations through Tweets, CNN and LSTM deep neural networks" by Marco Polignano et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses emotion detection and mentions the EmoContext task, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with this task.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The EmoContext task at SemEval 2019)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for the task. They mention that the training set consists of **30,000 records** annotated with three main emotions: Happy, Sad, and Angry, along with an 'other' class. This section provides a clear indication of the dataset's structure and its purpose.

In addition, I will look for any references to datasets in the **data processing and experiments sections**. The authors mention using various pre-trained word embeddings, such as Google word embeddings and GloVe, which are not datasets in themselves but are derived from larger datasets. However, they also reference the **Sentiment140 dataset**, which is used to create specific word embeddings for positive and negative tweets.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **EmoContext Dataset**: The dataset used for the EmoContext task is not explicitly cited in the references, but it is associated with the following paper:
   > Ankush Chatterjee, Kedhar Nath Narahari, Meghana Joshi, and Puneet Agrawal. *SemEval-2019 Task 3: EmoContext: Contextual emotion detection in text*. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, June 6–7, 2019.

2. **Sentiment140 Dataset**: The citation for the Sentiment140 dataset is:
   > Alec Go, Richa Bhayani, and Lei Huang. *Twitter Sentiment Classification using Distant Supervision*. In Proceedings of the 2009 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 119–126, 2009. 

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
