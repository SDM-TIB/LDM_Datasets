To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural language understanding for task oriented dialog in the biomedical domain in a low resources context" by Antoine Neuraz et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors are exploring data generation and augmentation methods due to the lack of sharable datasets in the biomedical domain, which suggests that they may have created or utilized specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for a training dataset for natural language understanding (NLU) models, particularly in the biomedical domain. They mention that they collected a set of 178 questions from medical doctors, which serves as a gold standard for their experiments. This indicates that this set of questions is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Data generation and augmentation)**, where the authors describe their methods for generating training and development sets. They mention generating a training dataset using templates and lab mentions, specifically stating that they created 16,000 utterances for the training set and 4,000 for the development set. This suggests that these generated datasets are crucial for their experiments.

In **section 3 (Experiments)**, the authors confirm the split of the question templates and lab mentions into training and development sets, further solidifying the importance of these datasets. They also mention the characteristics of the datasets, including the number of templates and lab mentions.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are generated by the authors and do not correspond to existing datasets, I will note that the primary dataset is the set of 178 questions collected from medical doctors.

The citation for the paper is:
> Antoine Neuraz, Anita Burgun, Leonardo Campillos Llanos, Sophie Rosset. *Natural language understanding for task oriented dialog in the biomedical domain in a low resources context*. In Proceedings of the Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) Workshop at NeurIPS 2018.

I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Generated Training Dataset**: Composed of 16,000 utterances created from templates and lab mentions.
2. **Development Dataset**: Composed of 4,000 utterances created similarly.

Since these datasets are generated and not from external sources, I will note that they are part of the authors' contributions to the field.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
