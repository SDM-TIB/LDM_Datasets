To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer-based Model for Single Documents Neural Summarization" by Elozino Egonmwan and Yllias Chali, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that they evaluate their system on the **CNN/DailyMail** and **Newsroom** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for training and evaluating summarization models. It consists of news articles paired with human-written summaries. The authors reference the original work that introduced this dataset.

2. **Newsroom Dataset**: This is a more recent dataset that contains over 1.3 million news articles along with various metadata, including summaries. The authors also cite the original paper that introduced this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 1693–1701, 2015.

- For the **Newsroom Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Max Grusky, Mor Naaman, and Yoav Artzi. *Newsroom: A dataset of 1.3 million summaries with diverse extractive strategies*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 708–719, 2018.

Now that I have the dataset names and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper references.
