To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IIIT-H at IJCNLP-2017 Task 4: Customer Feedback Analysis using Machine Learning and Neural Network Approaches" by Prathyusha Danda et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and corpus details sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses customer feedback analysis across four languages: English, French, Japanese, and Spanish. This suggests that there may be datasets related to customer feedback in these languages.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Corpus Details)**, which is likely to contain specific information about the datasets used. Here, the authors describe the corpus statistics, mentioning that the customer feedback data is extracted from Microsoft Office customers in the four languages. They also note that the feedback is annotated with six classes: comment, request, bug, complaint, meaningless, and undetermined. This section provides valuable context about the nature of the dataset.

I will also check for any explicit mentions of dataset names or references to where the data can be accessed. If the authors refer to any specific datasets or provide links, I will take note of those.

In the **References section**, I will look for any citations that might pertain to the datasets used in the study. If the authors reference any foundational works or datasets that are relevant to the customer feedback analysis, I will ensure to include those citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. 

For this paper, the datasets are likely to be:

1. **Customer Feedback Dataset**: This dataset consists of customer feedback reviews in English, French, Spanish, and Japanese, annotated with the six classes mentioned earlier.

Since the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset, I will note that it is derived from Microsoft Office customer feedback, but I will also check if there are any external references or publications that describe this dataset in detail.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
