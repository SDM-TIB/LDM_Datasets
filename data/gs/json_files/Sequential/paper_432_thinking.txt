To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Imperial College London Submission to VATEX Video Captioning Task" by Ozan Caglayan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the VATEX video captioning challenge, which suggests that a dataset is involved. The introduction further confirms this by stating that the authors are using the VATEX dataset for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide specific details about the VATEX dataset. They mention that it contains 25,991 training videos, 3,000 validation videos, and 6,000 test videos, each with 10 English and 10 Chinese captions. This section is crucial as it provides the necessary information about the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the VATEX dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **VATEX dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xin Wang, Jiawei Wu, Junkun Chen, Lei Li, Yuan-Fang Wang, and William Yang Wang. *VATEX: A large-scale, high-quality multilingual dataset for video-and-language research*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.03493, 2019.

Since the VATEX dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
