To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STUFIIT at SemEval-2019 Task 5: Multilingual Hate Speech Detection on Twitter with MUSE and ELMo Embeddings" by Michal Bojkovský and Matúš Pikuliak, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their models on a dataset of Twitter messages, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors describe the nature of the dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of collected messages from Twitter in English and Spanish, specifically for the task of hate speech detection. This gives me a clear indication that there are two language components to the dataset.

In the **introduction**, the authors provide specific details about the dataset: 
- The English part contains **10,000 messages**, with **42.1%** labeled as hate speech.
- The Spanish part contains **4,969 messages**, with **41.5%** labeled as hate speech.
This totals **14,969 messages**, with **6,270** categorized as hate speech.

I will also check the **results and conclusion sections** to confirm that this dataset was indeed used for their experiments and to gather any additional insights about its characteristics.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the task definition paper by Basile et al. (2019), which provides the authoritative citation for the dataset used in their study.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Valerio Basile, Cristina Bosco, Elisabetta Fersini, Debora Nozza, Viviana Patti, Francisco Rangel, Paolo Rosso, and Manuela Sanguinetti. *SemEval-2019 Task 5: Multilingual Detection of Hate Speech Against Immigrants and Women in Twitter*. In Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), pages 464–468, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, June 6–7, 2019.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the required structure. The dataset consists of Twitter messages in English and Spanish, specifically designed for hate speech detection, and the full citation is noted for proper attribution.
