To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UNH at SemEval-2019 Task 12: Toponym Resolution in Scientific Papers" by Matthew Magnusson and Laura Dietz, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the task and methods but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction discusses the challenge of toponym detection but does not provide specific dataset names either.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention a **gold standard corpus** composed of 150 full-text journal articles from PubMed Central (PMC). This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized for the task.

The paper also references **Weissenbacher et al. (2017)** for additional information about the corpus development, which suggests that this paper may contain further details about the dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the gold standard corpus. The relevant citation is:

- For the **gold standard corpus**, the citation is:
  > Davy Weissenbacher, Abeed Sarker, Tasnia Tahsin, Matthew Scotch, and Graciela Gonzalez. *SemEval-2019 Task 12: Toponym Resolution in Scientific Papers*. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pages 1308â€“1312, Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019.

Since the dataset is derived from the work of Weissenbacher et al., I will ensure to include this citation when describing the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the name, description, and full citation, into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
