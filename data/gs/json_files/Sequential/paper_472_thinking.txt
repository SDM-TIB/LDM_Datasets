To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Transformer and seq2seq model for Paraphrase Generation" by Elozino Egonmwan and Yllias Chali, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they evaluated their framework on **two datasets - QUORA and MSCOCO**. This indicates that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.3 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **QUORA Dataset**: This dataset contains over 120,000 examples of question pairs, which are used for paraphrase generation. The authors specify that they split this dataset into training and test sets of 80,000 and 40,000 examples, respectively.

2. **MSCOCO Dataset**: This dataset includes human annotations of images and is used for generating paraphrases in free-form text. The authors note that it contains more novel words and syntactic manipulations compared to the QUORA dataset.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **QUORA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Quora. *First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs*. Available at: https://data.quora.com/

- For the **MSCOCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and proper attribution.
