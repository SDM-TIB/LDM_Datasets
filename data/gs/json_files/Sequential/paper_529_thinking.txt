To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CX-ST-RNM at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Fusion of Recurrent Neural Networks Based on Contextualized and Static Word Representations for Contextual Emotion Detection" by Michał Perełkiewicz, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the model and its performance but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **approach** sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the EmoContext task and mentions that it involves classifying textual dialogues into sentiment classes. However, specific dataset names are not provided here.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Approach)**, particularly subsection 2.2, which discusses the handling of unbalanced datasets. The author mentions that the training data consists of about 5000 samples each from 'angry', 'sad', and 'happy' classes, and about 15000 samples from the 'others' class. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find its name.

The author refers to the datasets provided by the task organizers in the EmoContext web page. I will look for any explicit mention of the dataset names in this section or any subsequent sections.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the author does not provide specific names for the datasets used in the experiments. However, it is clear that the datasets are related to the EmoContext task from the SemEval 2019 competition.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers that might describe the datasets used. The author cites a paper by Ankush Chatterjee et al. (2019) that discusses the EmoContext task. This paper likely contains the necessary details about the datasets.

The citation for the EmoContext task paper is:
> Ankush Chatterjee, Kedhar Nath Narahari, Meghana Joshi, and Puneet Agrawal. *SemEval-2019 Task 3: Emocontext: Contextual emotion detection in text*. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2019.

Since the author does not provide specific dataset names in the paper, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **EmoContext Training Dataset**: Contains approximately 5000 samples each for 'angry', 'sad', and 'happy' classes, and about 15000 samples for the 'others' class. The exact name of the dataset is not specified in the paper.

2. **EmoContext Development and Test Datasets**: The author mentions using these datasets but does not provide specific names or details.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with the citations into a structured format for further processing.
