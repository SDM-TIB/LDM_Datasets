To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Word-level Textual Adversarial Attacking as Combinatorial Optimization" by Yuan Zang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **three benchmark datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In **Section 4.1**, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and consists of 25,000 training samples, 2,500 validation samples, and 25,000 test samples. The average sentence length is 234 words.

2. **SST-2 Dataset**: This is another sentiment analysis dataset with 6,920 training samples, 872 validation samples, and 10,000 test samples. The average sentence length is 17 words.

3. **SNLI Dataset**: This dataset is used for natural language inference (NLI) and contains 550,152 training samples, 10,000 validation samples, and 10,000 test samples. The average sentence length is 8 words.

The authors also provide accuracy results for the victim models (BiLSTM and BERT) on these datasets, which confirms their usage in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L Maas, Raymond E Daly, Peter T Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of ACL-HLT, 2011.

- For the **SST-2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of EMNLP, 2013.

- For the **SNLI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Samuel Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of EMNLP, 2015.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help in organizing the extracted data effectively for further processing or review.
