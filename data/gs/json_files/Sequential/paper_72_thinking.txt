To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Literary Event Detection" by Matthew Sims et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a new dataset of literary events, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset's purpose and context, providing a good foundation for understanding its significance.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **data** within the paper, which is often where authors describe their datasets in detail. In this case, I find that the authors mention their dataset in **section 1 (Introduction)**, where they state that they present a new annotated dataset of literary events comprising 210,532 tokens from 100 books. They also provide a link to access the dataset, which is crucial for citation.

In **section 4 (Event annotations)**, the authors describe the annotation process and the characteristics of the dataset, confirming its size and the number of events annotated. They also mention that the dataset is freely available under a Creative Commons ShareAlike 4.0 license, which is important for users who may want to utilize it.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the dataset. The paper states that the dataset is part of LitBank and provides a URL for access. I will format this citation properly:

- **LitBank Dataset**: 
  > Sims, M., Park, J. H., & Bamman, D. (2019). *Literary Event Detection*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 3623â€“3634. Florence, Italy. Available at: https://github.com/dbamman/litbank.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any critical details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
