To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Emotions using an Ensemble" by Wojciech Witon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a system for emotion prediction based on tweets, which suggests that there may be datasets related to tweets or emotions.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Task Description)**, where the authors describe the WASSA 2018 shared task. They mention a specific dataset provided for the competition, which contains around 188,000 tweets annotated with six emotion labels. This is a clear indication of a dataset that I need to document.

In **section 7 (Model Generalization)**, the authors refer to the **Cornell Movie Corpus**, which is used for testing their model's performance on explicit emotion prediction. This section provides additional context about the dataset, including its size and the nature of the annotations.

Now, I will compile the details of the datasets:

1. **WASSA 2018 Emotion Corpus**: This dataset consists of approximately 188,000 tweets, with a balanced distribution of examples across six emotion labels (anger, surprise, joy, sad, fear, disgust). The authors provide a detailed breakdown of the training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Cornell Movie Corpus**: This dataset includes around 300,000 utterances from 600 movies, with a subset of 58,000 lines manually annotated for emotions. The authors use this dataset to evaluate their model's performance on explicit emotion prediction.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **WASSA 2018 Emotion Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Klinger, R., de Clercq, O., Mohammad, S. M., & Balahur, A. (2018). IEST: WASSA-2018 implicit emotions shared task. In Proceedings of the 9th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis, pages 248â€“253. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **Cornell Movie Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, C., & Lee, L. (2011). Chameleons in imagined conversations: A new approach to understanding coordination of linguistic style in dialogs. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics, ACL 2011.

After gathering this information, I will prepare to format the dataset entries according to the specified requirements, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
