To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NSIT@NLP4IF-2019: Propaganda Detection from News Articles using Transfer Learning" by Kartik Aggarwal and Anubhav Sadana, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the task and mentions the use of a dataset provided by the organizers of the NLP4IF workshop, which indicates that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention that the dataset for the Sentence Level Classification (SLC) Task is provided by the organizers and consists of news articles in TXT format. They specify that the dataset is divided into a training set and a development set, with a total of 16,965 examples, including 4,720 labeled as propaganda and 12,245 as non-propaganda.

The authors also discuss the imbalance in the dataset and the technique of class oversampling used to address this issue. This section confirms the existence of a specific dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the paper indicates that the datasets for the tasks are not provided according to the workshop guidelines, which means there may not be a formal citation available for the dataset itself. Instead, I will note that the dataset is associated with the NLP4IF workshop.

Since the dataset is not formally cited in the references, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: NLP4IF 2019 SLC Task Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of news articles in TXT format, used for the Sentence Level Classification task. It contains 16,965 examples, with 4,720 labeled as propaganda and 12,245 as non-propaganda.
   - **Source**: Provided by the organizers of the NLP4IF workshop.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I highlight the lack of a formal citation for the dataset while providing a detailed description of its contents and purpose.
