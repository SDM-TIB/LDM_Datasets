To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can You Tell Me How to Get Past Sesame Street? Sentence-Level Pretraining Beyond Language Modeling" by Alex Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for evaluation or training.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the tasks and datasets used for pretraining and evaluation. In this paper, the authors discuss various pretraining tasks and their corresponding datasets, which are crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

In **Table 1**, the authors list several tasks used for pretraining and their associated datasets. I will extract the relevant datasets from this table, noting their names and any specific details provided about them. The tasks include:

1. **GLUE Tasks**: This includes several datasets such as:
   - **CoLA** (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability)
   - **SST** (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)
   - **MRPC** (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus)
   - **QQP** (Quora Question Pairs)
   - **STS** (Semantic Textual Similarity)
   - **MNLI** (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)
   - **QNLI** (Question Natural Language Inference)
   - **RTE** (Recognizing Textual Entailment)
   - **WNLI** (Winograd NLI)

2. **Outside Tasks**: These include datasets for additional tasks such as:
   - **WikiText-103** (WT)
   - **Billion Word Language Model Benchmark** (BWB)
   - **WMT14 English-German** (Machine Translation)
   - **WMT17 English-Russian** (Machine Translation)
   - **Reddit** (Response prediction)
   - **SkipThought** (Sequence-to-sequence prediction)

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

For example, the citation for the **GLUE benchmark** is:
> Wang, Alex, et al. "GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding." In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2019.

Similarly, I will find citations for the other datasets mentioned, ensuring that I have the correct authors, titles, publication venues, and years.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

This systematic approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing a comprehensive overview for future readers or researchers interested in this work.
