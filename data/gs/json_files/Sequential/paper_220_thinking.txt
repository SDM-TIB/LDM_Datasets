To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Argumentative Link Prediction using Residual Networks and Multi-Objective Learning" by Andrea Galassi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and benchmark sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on a "challenging dataset consisting of user-generated comments collected from an online platform." This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Benchmark)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for evaluation. Here, they mention the **Cornell eRulemaking Corpus (CDCP)**, which consists of 731 user comments from an eRulemaking website, totaling about 4,700 propositions. The authors also describe the argument model and the classification of propositions within the dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CDCP dataset. The authors reference the original work by Niculae et al. (2017), which provides the necessary citation for the dataset.

The citation for the **Cornell eRulemaking Corpus (CDCP)** is:
> Vlad Niculae, Joonsuk Park, and Claire Cardie. *Argument mining with structured SVMs and RNNs*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2017, Vancouver, Canada, July 30 - August 4, Volume 1: Long Papers, pages 985â€“995. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Cornell eRulemaking Corpus (CDCP)**: This dataset consists of 731 user comments from an eRulemaking website, containing approximately 4,700 propositions. The dataset is structured according to an argument model proposed by Park et al. (2015a), with propositions classified into five categories: POLICY, VALUE, FACT, TESTIMONY, and REFERENCE.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
