To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning Techniques for Humor Detection in Hindi-English Code-Mixed Tweets" by Sushmitha Reddy Sane et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors focus on humor detection in code-mixed tweets, which suggests that they likely used a dataset of tweets for their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Results)**, where the authors mention using a benchmark dataset published by Khandelwal et al. (2018) for evaluating their models. This section provides crucial information about the dataset, including its size and the distribution of labels (humorous vs. non-humorous).

The authors specify that the dataset contains **3543 annotated tweets**, with **1755 labeled as humorous** and **1698 as non-humorous**. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the dataset used in the study, the citation is:
  > Ankush Khandelwal, Sahil Swami, Syed S Akhtar, and Manish Shrivastava. *Humor detection in English-Hindi code-mixed social media content: Corpus and baseline system*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.05513, 2018.

Since this dataset is the primary one referenced in the paper, I will ensure to include it in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research.
