To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ELMoLex: Connecting ELMo and Lexicon features for Dependency Parsing" by Ganesh Jawahar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors participated in the CoNLL 2018 Shared Task, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using **82 treebanks provided by the shared task**. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, but I need to find the specific names of these treebanks.

I will check **Table 1**, which lists the treebanks used for training data for delexicalized parsing. This table provides a clear overview of the target treebanks and their corresponding source datasets. The table includes entries like:

- **af_afribooms**
- **da_dadt**
- **el_gdt**
- **fr_sequoia**
- **hu_szeged**
- **sv_lines**
- **tr_imst**
- **zh_gsd**

These entries represent the datasets utilized in their experiments.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the Universal Dependencies (UD) framework, which is the source of the treebanks. The relevant citation for the Universal Dependencies datasets is:

> Joakim Nivre et al. (2016). *Universal Dependencies v1: A multilingual treebank collection*. In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016). European Language Resources Association, Portorož, Slovenia, pages 1659–1666.

Additionally, the authors mention the UDLexicons, which is another dataset they utilized. The citation for this resource is:

> Benoît Sagot. (2018). *A multilingual collection of conll-u-compatible morphological lexicons*. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, LREC 2018. Miyazaki, Japan.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
