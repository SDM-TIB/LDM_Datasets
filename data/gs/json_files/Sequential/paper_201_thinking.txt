To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Language Modeling with Gated Convolutional Networks" by Yann N. Dauphin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving state-of-the-art results on the **WikiText-103 benchmark** and competitive results on the **Google Billion Words benchmark**. This indicates that these datasets are likely significant for their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Google Billion Word dataset**: This dataset is noted for being one of the largest language modeling datasets, containing almost one billion tokens and a vocabulary of over 800,000 words. The authors provide details about the dataset's structure, including that words appearing less than three times are replaced with a special unknown symbol.

2. **WikiText-103**: This dataset is described as having over 100 million tokens and a vocabulary of about 200,000 words. The authors highlight that the sentences in this dataset are consecutive, allowing models to condition on larger contexts rather than single sentences.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Google Billion Word dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chelba, Ciprian, Mikolov, Tomas, Schuster, Mike, Ge, Qi, Brants, Thorsten, Koehn, Philipp, and Robinson, Tony. *One billion word benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.3005, 2013.

- For the **WikiText-103 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., and Socher, R. *Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models*. ArXiv e-prints, September 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
