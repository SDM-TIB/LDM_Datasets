To extract datasets from the technical report titled "FastFusionNet: New State-of-the-Art for DAWNBench SQuAD" by Felix Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that FastFusionNet achieves state-of-the-art results on SQuAD, which indicates that SQuAD is a dataset used in their work. 

In the **introduction**, the authors list several reading comprehension datasets, including **SQuAD**, **SQuAD v2**, **WikiQA**, **TriviaQA**, **SearchQA**, **NarrativeQA**, **CoQA**, **QuAC**, and **Natural Questions**. This section provides a clear indication of the datasets relevant to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their experimental setup. They specifically mention using the **SQuAD dataset**, which contains 87K, 10K, and 10K context-question pairs for training, development, and testing, respectively. This confirms that SQuAD is the primary dataset utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SQuAD dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2016.

Since SQuAD is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the context of their experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
