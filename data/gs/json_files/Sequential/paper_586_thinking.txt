To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Named Entity Recognition - Is there a glass ceiling?" by Tomasz Stanislawek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the results are based on the **CoNLL 2003 dataset** for the English language, which indicates that this is a primary dataset used in their research. I will note this down as it is explicitly mentioned.

Next, I will look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **methodology** or **results** sections. In the methodology, the authors discuss their analysis of errors on the CoNLL 2003 dataset, but they also mention the creation of **new diagnostic datasets** attached in the supplementary materials. I will need to check the supplementary materials for details on these new datasets.

In the **results** section, the authors present findings based on the CoNLL 2003 dataset and the new diagnostic datasets they created. They refer to two specific types of diagnostic datasets: **Document Context Sentences (DCS)** and **Template Sentences (TS)**. I will ensure to include these in my extraction.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **CoNLL 2003 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Erik F. Tjong Kim Sang and Fien De Meulder. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 Shared Task: Language-Independent Named Entity Recognition*. In Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Natural Language Learning at HLT-NAACL 2003.

2. **Document Context Sentences (DCS)** and **Template Sentences (TS)**: Since these are new datasets introduced by the authors, I will check the supplementary materials for their specific citations. If they are not formally published, I will note them as supplementary datasets created by the authors.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
