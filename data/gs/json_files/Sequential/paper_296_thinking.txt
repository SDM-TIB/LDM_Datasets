To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BioFLAIR: Pretrained Pooled Contextualized Embeddings for Biomedical Sequence Labeling Tasks" by Shreyas Sharma and Ron Daniel, Jr., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of FLAIR on various bio NER tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that FLAIR has achieved state-of-the-art results on common NER datasets like CoNLL-03 and Ontonotes. However, I need to find specific datasets related to biomedical NER.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly Table 1, which lists three corpora extracted from PubMed for pretraining:

1. **PubMed (V1)**: A sample of 1,219,734 PubMed abstracts (5% of abstracts until 2015).
2. **PubMed (V2)**: A sample of 261,736 PubMed abstracts (after 2000).
3. **PubMed (V3)**: A sample of 281,394 PubMed abstracts (after 2000).

These corpora are crucial for understanding the pretraining process of the FLAIR model.

Then, I will examine **Table 2** in the method section, which lists the benchmark corpora used for evaluation:

1. **NCBI-disease**: Contains 7,287 sentences focused on disease entities.
2. **BC5CDR-disease**: Contains 15,030 sentences focused on disease entities.
3. **BC5CDR**: Contains 15,030 sentences focused on disease and drug/chemical entities.
4. **JNLPBA**: Contains 24,806 sentences focused on gene/protein entities.
5. **Species-800**: Contains 8,193 sentences focused on species entities.
6. **LINNAEUS**: Contains 23,152 sentences focused on species entities.

These datasets are explicitly mentioned and are essential for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation for clarity and proper attribution.
