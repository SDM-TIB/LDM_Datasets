To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probing the phonetic and phonological knowledge of tones in Mandarin TTS models" by Jian Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments involving controlled stimuli for testing tonal coarticulation and tone sandhi in Mandarin, which suggests that specific datasets or corpora may be used.

Next, I will examine the **methods** section, particularly the **stimuli** subsections, to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. In section 3.1, the author describes the stimuli for tonal coarticulation, which consists of 576 sentences created from bisyllabic combinations of syllables with different tones. However, this does not refer to a formal dataset but rather to the experimental stimuli generated for the study.

In section 4.1, the author mentions the **Chinese Standard Mandarin Speech Corpus (CSMSC)**, which is explicitly stated as the training data for both Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow models. This is a crucial dataset, and I will need to extract its details.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the CSMSC in the references section. The citation is provided as follows:
> Chinese Standard Mandarin Speech Corpus (CSMSC). Available at: https://www.data-baker.com/open_source.html

Since the CSMSC is the only formal dataset mentioned in the paper, I will summarize it as follows:

1. **Chinese Standard Mandarin Speech Corpus (CSMSC)**: This dataset consists of 10,000 recorded sentences read by a female speaker, totaling 12 hours of natural speech with phoneme-level Textgrid annotations and text transcriptions. It is used for training the TTS models in the study.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CSMSC as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
