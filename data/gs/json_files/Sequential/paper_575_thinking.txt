To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Looking for ELMo’s Friends: Sentence-Level Pretraining Beyond Language Modeling," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides an overview of the study's focus on pretraining tasks, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Pretraining Tasks)**, where the authors describe the various pretraining tasks and their corresponding datasets. This section is likely to contain the most relevant information regarding the datasets used in their experiments.

In this section, I will note the following datasets:

1. **GLUE Benchmark**: The authors mention using nine tasks from the GLUE benchmark, which includes datasets like:
   - **CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability)**: Used for acceptability classification.
   - **SST (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: Used for binary sentiment classification.
   - **MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus)**: Used for semantic similarity.
   - **QQP (Quora Question Pairs)**: Another dataset for semantic similarity.
   - **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: Used for textual entailment.
   - **RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment)**: A series of datasets for entailment tasks.
   - **QNLI (Question Natural Language Inference)**: Derived from SQuAD for entailment.
   - **STS-B (Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark)**: For measuring semantic similarity.
   - **WNLI (Winograd NLI)**: A dataset for natural language inference.

2. **WikiText-103**: This dataset is used for language modeling tasks and is mentioned in the context of training language models.

3. **1 Billion Word Language Model Benchmark**: Another dataset used for language modeling.

4. **WMT14 English-German and WMT17 English-Russian**: These datasets are used for machine translation tasks.

5. **Reddit Dataset**: The authors mention using a dataset of approximately 18 million comment-response pairs from Reddit for their response prediction task.

After identifying these datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
