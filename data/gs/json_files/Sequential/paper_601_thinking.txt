To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Structural Probe for Finding Syntax in Word Representations" by John Hewitt and Christopher D. Manning, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their probing methods and the importance of understanding linguistic knowledge in word representations. I will pay attention to any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors describe their approach and the specific datasets they utilized. In this paper, they mention using the **Penn Treebank** for their experiments, which is a well-known dataset in natural language processing.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide more details about the Penn Treebank dataset, such as its structure or the specific splits used (train/dev/test).

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the Penn Treebank, the citation is:

- **Penn Treebank**: 
  > Mitchell P Marcus, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, and Beatrice Santorini. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313â€“330, 1993.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly describes the dataset and includes the full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and ready for further processing or review.
