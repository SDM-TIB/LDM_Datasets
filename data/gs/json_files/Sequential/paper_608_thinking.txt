To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NL-FIIT at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Emotion Detection From Conversational Triplets Using Hierarchical Encoders" by Michal Farkas and Peter Lacko, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the EmoContext task, which suggests that there is a specific dataset associated with this task.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference the EmoContext task (Chatterjee et al., 2019b), which implies that there is a dataset used for emotion detection in conversational triplets. I will need to confirm the details of this dataset in the subsequent sections.

In the **approach section**, I will check if the authors describe the dataset used for training and evaluation. They mention using a preprocessing tool called Ekphrasis, but I need to find specific details about the dataset itself. If the dataset is not explicitly named here, I will look for any references to it in the **evaluation section** or any tables that summarize the results.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the dataset used is indeed the **EmoContext dataset**, which is specifically designed for the emotion detection task in conversational contexts. The authors do not provide extensive details about the dataset in the main text, but they reference the original paper that describes the EmoContext task.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the EmoContext dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **EmoContext dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ankush Chatterjee, Kedhar Nath Narahari, Meghana Joshi, and Puneet Agrawal. *Semeval-2019 task 3: Emocontext: Contextual emotion detection in text*. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2019.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset details, including its name and citation, ensuring that I provide the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that all necessary information is included and accurately represented.
