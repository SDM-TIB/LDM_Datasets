To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AdaBERT: Task-Adaptive BERT Compression with Differentiable Neural Architecture Search" by Daoyuan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors evaluate AdaBERT on several NLP tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction further emphasizes the use of large-scale datasets for training BERT models, indicating that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they state that they evaluate AdaBERT on six datasets from the GLUE benchmark, which includes:

1. **SST-2**: A dataset for sentiment classification, where the goal is to label movie reviews as positive or negative.
2. **MRPC**: A dataset for semantic equivalence classification, consisting of sentence pairs extracted from news sources.
3. **QQP**: Another dataset for semantic equivalence classification, with sentence pairs sourced from online websites.
4. **MNLI**: A dataset for textual entailment recognition, containing premise-hypothesis pairs that vary in domains and scales.
5. **QNLI**: A dataset for textual entailment recognition, similar to MNLI but with a different structure.
6. **RTE**: Another dataset for textual entailment recognition, which also varies in domain and scale.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper references the GLUE benchmark, which is a well-known collection of datasets for evaluating NLP models. The citation for the GLUE benchmark is:

- For GLUE:
  > Alex Wang, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel R. Bowman. *GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding*. In ICLR, 2019.

Since the individual datasets (SST-2, MRPC, QQP, MNLI, QNLI, RTE) are part of the GLUE benchmark, they do not have separate citations in the references. The GLUE paper serves as the authoritative source for these datasets.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the GLUE benchmark as the source for all the datasets mentioned.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness in the representation of each dataset.
