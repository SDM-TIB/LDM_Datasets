To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Distance Relationships without Time Travel: Boosting the Performance of a Sparse Predictive Autoencoder in Sequence Modeling" by Jeremy Gordon et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a "next word prediction task on the Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset," which indicates that this dataset is relevant.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the tasks and datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Stochastic Sequential MNIST (ssMNIST)**: This dataset is used for a partially observable sequence learning task involving higher-order sequences of MNIST digits. The authors provide a detailed description of how this dataset is generated, including the grammar used for creating sequences.

2. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: This dataset is used for language modeling tasks. The authors note that they follow preprocessing steps as per Mikolov et al. for this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Penn Treebank (PTB)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M., Kim, G., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., MacIntyre, R., Bies, A., Ferguson, M., Katz, K., and Schasberger, B. *The Penn Treebank: Annotating Predicate Argument Structure*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Human Language Technology, 1994, Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 114â€“119.

- The **Stochastic Sequential MNIST (ssMNIST)** dataset is based on the original MNIST dataset, which is widely known and does not have a specific citation in this paper. However, the original MNIST dataset citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., and Burges, C. J. C. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
