To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation of Stacked Embeddings for Bulgarian on the Downstream Tasks POS and NERC" by Iva Marinova, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses experiments with different stacks of word embeddings for Bulgarian downstream tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the author mentions the Bulgarian National Research Infrastructure for Language, Culture and History Resources and Tools â€” CLaDA-BG, as a source of data for Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging tasks. This indicates that CLaDA-BG is a dataset relevant to the research.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific datasets used in the experiments. The author describes the BulTreeBank (BTB) dataset, which consists of 14,732 sentences from various genres, and provides details about the training, development, and testing splits. This dataset is crucial for the NERC and POS tagging tasks discussed in the paper.

The author also mentions that the Universal Dependency version of BulTreeBank is used for POS tagging, which can be found at a specific URL. This indicates that there are two datasets to consider: the original BulTreeBank dataset and its Universal Dependency version.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **BulTreeBank (BTB)** dataset, the citation is:
   > Kiril Simov, Petya Osenova, Milena Slavcheva, Sia Kolkovska, Elisaveta Balabanova, Dimitar Doikoff, Krassimira Ivanova, Alexander Simov, and Milen Kouylekov. *Building a linguistically interpreted corpus of Bulgarian: the BulTreeBank*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC), 2002.

2. For the **Universal Dependency version of BulTreeBank**, the citation is:
   > Petya Osenova and Kiril Simov. *Universalizing BulTreeBank: a linguistic tale about globalization*. In The 5th Workshop on Balto-Slavic Natural Language Processing, 2015.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **BulTreeBank (BTB)**: A dataset consisting of 14,732 sentences from various genres, used for NERC and POS tagging tasks.
- **Universal Dependency version of BulTreeBank**: A version of the BTB dataset adapted for Universal Dependency tagging, available for download at the specified URL.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation.
