To extract datasets from the research paper titled "JUSTDeep at NLP4IF 2019 Shared Task: Propaganda Detection using Ensemble Deep Learning Models" by Hani Al-Omari et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their model on a dataset provided by the NLP4IF 2019 challenge, which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset and Extracted Features)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of 350 articles for training and 61 articles for development, totaling 411 articles in plain text format. They also provide information about the number of sentences in the training data, which is 16,975, with 12,244 labeled as non-propaganda and 4,721 as propaganda.

The authors reference the dataset as being provided by the shared task on fine-grained propaganda detection, specifically citing the work of Da San Martino et al. (2019). This is crucial for obtaining the full citation of the dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the complete citation for the dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the NLP4IF 2019 dataset, the citation is:
  > Giovanni Da San Martino, Seunghak Yu, Alberto Barrón-Cedeño, Rostislav Petrov, and Preslav Nakov. *Fine-grained analysis of propaganda in news articles*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019, Hong Kong, China, November 3-7, 2019.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset:

1. **NLP4IF 2019 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 411 articles (350 for training and 61 for development) in plain text format, with sentences labeled as either propaganda or non-propaganda.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with its full citation, ensuring that it is ready for any structured output or further processing.
