To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BERT for Coreference Resolution: Baselines and Analysis" by Mandar Joshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving improvements on the **OntoNotes** and **GAP** benchmarks, indicating that these are datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections to gather more details about these datasets. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their models on the **GAP** dataset and the **OntoNotes** dataset. 

1. **GAP Dataset**: The authors describe it as a human-labeled corpus of ambiguous pronoun-name pairs derived from Wikipedia snippets. This dataset is specifically designed for evaluating coreference resolution models.

2. **OntoNotes Dataset**: This dataset is described as a document-level dataset from the CoNLL-2012 shared task on coreference resolution, consisting of about one million words from various sources including news articles and conversations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **GAP dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kellie Webster, Marta Recasens, Vera Axelrod, and Jason Baldridge. *Mind the GAP: A balanced corpus of gendered ambiguous pronouns*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 6:605–617, 2018.

- For the **OntoNotes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sameer Pradhan, Alessandro Moschitti, Nianwen Xue, Olga Uryupina, and Yuchen Zhang. *CoNLL-2012 shared task: Modeling multilingual unrestricted coreference in OntoNotes*. In Joint Conference on EMNLP and CoNLL - Shared Task, pages 1–40, 2012.

Having gathered this information, I will now prepare to compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further processing or review of the datasets used in the research.
