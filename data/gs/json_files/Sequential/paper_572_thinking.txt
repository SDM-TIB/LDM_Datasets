To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SOURce-Conditional Elmo-style Model for Machine Translation Quality Estimation" by Junpei Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **WMT QE dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their work.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 3) to find detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors provide statistics about the datasets, specifically mentioning the **En-De-SMT**, **En-De-NMT**, and **En-Ru** datasets. They also provide the number of training, development, and test samples for each dataset, which is important for understanding the dataset's scope.

In **Table 1**, the authors summarize the statistics of the parallel data and QE data, which includes:
- **En-De-SMT**: 32.8M parallel sentences, with 26,299 training pairs, 1,000 development pairs, and 1,926 test pairs.
- **En-De-NMT**: 32.8M parallel sentences, with 13,442 training pairs, 1,000 development pairs, and 1,023 test pairs.
- **En-Ru**: 8.0M parallel sentences, with 15,089 training pairs, 1,000 development pairs, and 1,023 test pairs.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors mention that the parallel data is collected from the **WMT-18 translation task**, so I will cite the relevant WMT papers for the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:
- For **WMT-18 En-De-SMT** and **En-De-NMT** datasets, the citation is:
  > Chatterjee, R., Negri, M., Rubino, R., & Turchi, M. (2018). Findings of the WMT 2018 shared task on automatic post-editing. In Proceedings of the Third Conference on Machine Translation: Shared Task Papers (pp. 710-725). Belgium, Brussels.

- For **WMT-19 En-Ru** dataset, the citation is:
  > Chatterjee, R., Negri, M., Rubino, R., & Turchi, M. (2019). Findings of the WMT 2019 shared task on quality estimation. In Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT) (pp. 106-111). Florence, Italy.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
