To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Contextual Representation Learning Without Softmax Layer" by Liunian Harold Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the efficiency of the proposed framework but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments** sections for more details.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that their method is evaluated on various downstream tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, particularly the subsections that detail the experimental setup. Here, the authors describe the models and tasks they evaluated, which often include the datasets used. 

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention several datasets used for evaluation:

1. **SNLI Dataset**: This dataset is used for the textual entailment task. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In EMNLP, 2015.

2. **CoNLL 2012 Dataset**: This dataset is used for coreference resolution tasks. The citation is:
   > Sameer Pradhan, Alessandro Moschitti, and Nianwen Xue, editors. *EMNLP-CoNLL*, 2012.

3. **SST-5 Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis tasks. The citation is:
   > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In EMNLP, 2013.

4. **CoNLL 2003 NER Dataset**: This dataset is used for named entity recognition tasks. The citation is:
   > Erik F. Sang and Fien De Meulder. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the CoNLL, 2003.

5. **Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) Dataset**: This dataset is used for modeling predicate-argument structures. The citation is:
   > Sameer Pradhan, Alessandro Moschitti, Nianwen Xue, Hwee Tou Ng, Anders Bj√∂rkelund, Olga Uryupina, Yuchen Zhang, and Zhi Zhong. *Towards robust linguistic analysis using ontonotes*. In CoNLL, 2013.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile their full citations accurately for future reference.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ready for any further processing or documentation needs.
