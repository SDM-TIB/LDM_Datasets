To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language Modeling Teaches You More Syntax than Translation Does: Lessons Learned Through Auxiliary Task Analysis" by Kelly W. Zhang and Samuel R. Bowman, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The introduction provides context about the research, and the methodology section often details the datasets used for training and evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of understanding how different pretraining objectives affect the linguistic information learned by models. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets here.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors state that they exclusively train on datasets from **WMT 2016** and use the **parallel En-De corpus** for their experiments. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their analysis.

In addition, they mention augmenting the parallel data with a **large monolingual corpus from WMT**. This suggests that both the parallel corpus and the monolingual corpus are significant datasets used in their research.

Moving on to the **results section**, the authors analyze the performance of their models on two specific syntactic evaluation tasks: **part-of-speech (POS) tagging on the Penn Treebank WSJ** and **CCG supertagging on CCG Bank**. This indicates that both the Penn Treebank and CCG Bank datasets are utilized for evaluation.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. For the **WMT 2016 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ondrej Bojar, Rajen Chatterjee, Christian Federmann, Yvette Graham, Barry Haddow, Matthias Huck, Antonio Jimeno Yepes, Philipp Koehn, Varvara Logacheva, Christof Monz, Matteo Negri, Aurelie Neveol, Mariana Neves, Martin Popel, Matt Post, Raphael Rubino, Carolina Scarton, Lucia Specia, Marco Turchi, Karin Verspoor, and Marcos Zampieri. *Findings of the 2016 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT16)*. ACL, 2016.

2. For the **Penn Treebank WSJ**, the citation is:
   > Mitchell P. Marcus, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, and Beatrice Santorini. *Building a Large Annotated Corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313–330, 1993.

3. For the **CCG Bank**, the citation is:
   > Julia Hockenmaier and Mark Steedman. *CCGbank: A Corpus of CCG Derivations and Dependency Structures Extracted from the Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 33(3):355–396, 2007.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
