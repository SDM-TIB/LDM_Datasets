To extract datasets from the research paper titled "YNU DYX at SemEval-2019 Task 5: A Stacked BiGRU Model Based on Capsule Network in Detection of Hate" by Yunxia Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data processing sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates participation in SemEval 2019 Task 5, which suggests that there are specific datasets used for the task.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the nature of hate speech and the relevance of the task, but I need to look for specific dataset details. The **data processing section** is crucial, as it typically contains information about the datasets used in the experiments.

In **section 2.1 (Experimental Data)**, the authors provide a clear breakdown of the datasets used for the task. They mention that the task involves a binary classification of hate speech about immigrants or women, and they specify the following datasets:

1. **Training Set**: Contains 9,000 tweets, with 3,783 labeled as hate speech and 5,217 as non-hate speech.
2. **Development Set**: Contains 1,000 tweets, with 427 labeled as hate speech and 573 as non-hate speech.
3. **Test Set**: Contains 2,971 tweets, with 1,252 labeled as hate speech and 1,719 as non-hate speech.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset used in the SemEval 2019 Task 5. The relevant citation is:

- For the SemEval 2019 Task 5 dataset, the citation is:
  > Valerio Basile, Cristina Bosco, Elisabetta Fersini, Debora Nozza, Viviana Patti, Francisco Rangel, Paolo Rosso, and Manuela Sanguinetti. *SemEval-2019 Task 5: Multilingual Detection of Hate Speech Against Immigrants and Women in Twitter*. In Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their details, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citations are complete and accurate.
