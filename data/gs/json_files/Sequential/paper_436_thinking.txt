To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "DS at SemEval-2019 Task 9: From Suggestion Mining with Neural Networks to Adversarial Cross-Domain Classification" by Tobias Cabanski, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that there are two subtasks related to suggestion mining, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction further elaborates on the tasks and mentions that Subtask A has a training set provided, while Subtask B does not have labeled data.

Next, I will focus on the **Data** section, which is crucial for identifying the datasets used in both subtasks. In this section, the author provides specific details about the datasets:

1. **Subtask A Dataset**: The dataset consists of 8,500 examples, with 2,085 labeled as suggestions and 6,415 as non-suggestions. Additionally, there is a trial dataset with 592 examples (296 for each class). This dataset is explicitly mentioned as being derived from online suggestion forums.

2. **Subtask B Dataset**: For this subtask, only a validation dataset is provided, containing 808 examples (404 for each class). The author notes that this dataset is not allowed to be used for supervised training but is meant for evaluation purposes.

Furthermore, the author mentions the use of an external dataset for Subtask B, specifically the **hotel review dataset** from Wachsmuth et al. (2014), which contains nearly 200,000 examples of hotel reviews without labels. This dataset is crucial for the cross-domain classification approach used in Subtask B.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **hotel review dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wachsmuth, H., Trenkmann, M., Stein, B., Engels, G., & Palakarska, T. (2014). A review corpus for argumentation analysis. In Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics (pp. 115â€“127). Berlin Heidelberg New York: Springer.

Next, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Subtask A Dataset**: 8,500 examples (2,085 suggestions, 6,415 non-suggestions).
2. **Subtask B Validation Dataset**: 808 examples (404 suggestions, 404 non-suggestions).
3. **Hotel Review Dataset**: Nearly 200,000 examples (unlabeled).

I will now prepare to format this information according to the specified requirements.
