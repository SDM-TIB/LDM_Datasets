To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contextual Emotion Detection Using a Combination of Neural Networks and SVM" by Elham Mohammadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper focuses on contextual emotion detection in a dataset of 3-round dialogues, which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors discuss the challenges of emotion detection in dialogues and reference the SemEval 2019 Task 3 (EmoContext), which implies that the dataset used for their experiments is related to this task.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any detailed descriptions of the dataset. The authors mention that they participated in the EmoContext task, which is a clear indication that the dataset they used is the one provided for this shared task. I will confirm this by checking for any specific details about the dataset, such as its size, structure, and the types of dialogues it contains.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional context about the dataset, such as performance metrics or comparisons with other datasets. This can help clarify the dataset's significance in their experiments.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the EmoContext dataset. Since the dataset is associated with a specific task in a conference, I will look for the corresponding paper that describes the dataset in detail.

Based on my findings, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the EmoContext dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the required structure for downstream processing.
