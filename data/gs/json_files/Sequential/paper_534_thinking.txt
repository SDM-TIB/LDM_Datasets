To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Labeled Parsing with Deep Inside-Outside Recursive Autoencoders" by Andrew Drozdov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their approach on two versions of the **Wall Street Journal (WSJ) dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors discuss their methodology and results. In **Section 4.3**, they specifically mention the **WSJ-10 dataset** and the **full WSJ test set** as the datasets used for evaluation. This confirms that the WSJ datasets are central to their research.

Now, I will look for the full citations of these datasets in the **References section**. The WSJ dataset is widely recognized in the field, and its citation is as follows:

- For the **Wall Street Journal (WSJ) dataset**, the citation is:
  > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2015.

Since the authors refer to two versions of the WSJ dataset, I will ensure to note that both the **WSJ-10** and the **full WSJ test set** are derived from the same source.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
