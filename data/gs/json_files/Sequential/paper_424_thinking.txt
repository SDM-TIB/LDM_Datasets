To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLEARumor at SemEval-2019 Task 7: ConvoLving ELMo Against Rumors" by Ipek Baris et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions participation in SemEval-2019 Task 7, which suggests that there is a dataset involved, specifically the RumourEval dataset.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **evaluation** sections. In this case, the introduction references the RumourEval 2019 dataset, which is crucial for both subtasks A and B.

I will then check the **evaluation section** and **table 1**, which summarizes the dataset's structure, including the number of labeled instances for both subtasks, broken down by social media platform (Twitter and Reddit) and dataset splits (train, dev, test). This confirms the dataset's relevance and provides additional details about its composition.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the RumourEval dataset. The paper cites the dataset as follows:

- For the RumourEval 2019 dataset, the citation is:
  > Genevieve Gorrell, Kalina Bontcheva, Leon Derczynski, Elena Kochkina, Maria Liakata, and Arkaitz Zubiaga. *SemEval-2019 Task 7: RumourEval: Determining Rumour Veracity and Support for Rumours*. In SemEval@NAACL-HLT. ACL, 2019.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset:

1. **RumourEval 2019 Dataset**: This dataset consists of labeled threads from Twitter and Reddit, where each source post mentions a rumor. It is used for two subtasks: subtask A (classifying the type of interaction) and subtask B (predicting the veracity of the rumor).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations for the dataset used in the research paper.
