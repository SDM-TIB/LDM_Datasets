To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distilling Knowledge Learned in BERT for Text Generation" by Yen-Chun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on multiple language generation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets they used for machine translation and summarization tasks.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **IWSLT15 English-Vietnamese (En-Vi)**: This dataset contains 113,000 training samples and is used for machine translation tasks. The authors reference the pre-processed dataset provided by Luong and Manning (2015).

2. **IWSLT14 German-English (De-En)**: This dataset consists of 160,000 training samples and is also used for machine translation. The authors follow the pre-processing steps outlined by Wu et al. (2019).

3. **WMT14 English-German (En-De)**: This medium-scale dataset has 4.5 million training samples and is used for machine translation. The authors follow the pre-processing steps in Vaswani et al. (2017).

4. **Gigaword**: This dataset is used for abstractive summarization and has an original split of 3.8 million training samples, 190,000 validation samples, and 2,000 test samples. The authors mention that they sampled from the validation set for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **IWSLT15 English-Vietnamese**, the citation is:
  > Minh-Thang Luong and Christopher D. Manning. *Stanford neural machine translation systems for spoken language domain*. In Proceedings of the IWSLT, 2015.

- For **IWSLT14 German-English**, the citation is:
  > Myle Ott, Sergey Edunov, David Grangier, and Michael Auli. *Scaling neural machine translation*. In Proceedings of the WMT, 2018.

- For **WMT14 English-German**, the citation is:
  > Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N Gomez, Łukasz Kaiser, and Illia Polosukhin. *Attention is all you need*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2017.

- For **Gigaword**, the citation is:
  > Ramesh Nallapati, Bowen Zhou, Caglar Gulcehre, Bing Xiang, et al. *Abstractive text summarization using sequence-to-sequence RNNs and beyond*. In Proceedings of the CoNLL, 2016.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
