To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sentence-Level Propaganda Detection in News Articles with Transfer Learning and BERT-BiLSTM-Capsule Model" by George-Alexandru Vlad et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the NLP4IF-2019 Shared Task for sentence-level propaganda detection, which suggests that there are specific datasets used for this task.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **SLC Dataset**: This dataset contains 350 articles annotated for the presence of propaganda with two labels: propaganda and non-propaganda. This dataset is crucial for training their model.

2. **Emotion Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as a unified collection of several emotion-labeled datasets, which includes the Daily Dialogue dataset and the Semeval-2019 Task 3 dataset. The Daily Dialogue dataset contains 11,318 transcribed dialogues annotated for seven emotions, while the Semeval-2019 dataset contains 15,000 records for three emotion classes and additional records not belonging to any of the specified classes.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Daily Dialogue dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yanran Li, Hui Su, Xiaoyu Shen, Wenjie Li, Ziqiang Cao, and Shuzi Niu. *Dailydialog: A manually labelled multi-turn dialogue dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.03957, 2017.

- For the **Semeval-2019 Task 3 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ankush Chatterjee, Kedhar Nath Narahari, Meghana Joshi, and Puneet Agrawal. *SemEval-2019 Task 3: EmoContext Contextual Emotion Detection in Text*. In Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pages 39–48, 2019.

- For the **SLC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Giovanni Da San Martino, Seunghak Yu, Alberto Barrón-Cedeño, Rostislav Petrov, and Preslav Nakov. *Fine-Grained Analysis of Propaganda in News Articles*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
