To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Medical Text Inference Using Ensemble BERT-BiLSTM-Attention Model" by Lung-Hao Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the MEDIQA challenge, which suggests that specific datasets were used for their experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus** and the **MedNLI dataset**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are relevant to their work. The introduction also provides context about the limitations of the SNLI corpus and the purpose of the MedNLI dataset.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Evaluation)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for the NLI task. They specifically mention that the sentence-pairs for the NLI task were collected from the **MedNLI dataset**. The authors provide details about the training, validation, and test datasets, including the number of sentence-pairs in each set.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **MedNLI Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alexey Romanov, and Chaitanya Shivade. 2018. Lessons from natural language inference in the clinical domain. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1586-1596. https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1187

2. **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus**: The citation is:
   > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. 2015. A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 632-642. https://aclweb.org/anthology/papers/D/D15/D15-1075/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
