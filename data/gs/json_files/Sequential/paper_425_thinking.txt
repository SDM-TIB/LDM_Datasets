To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning for Hindi Text Classification: A Comparison" by Ramchandra Joshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract highlights the use of translated datasets for evaluating models, which suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list and describe the datasets used in their research. Here, I find the following datasets:

1. **TREC Question Dataset**: This dataset is used for classifying question sentences into six types. It consists of 5,452 training samples and 500 testing samples, with a predefined train-test split.

2. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-1 and SST-2)**: 
   - **SST-1** contains one-sentence movie reviews rated on a scale of 1-5, with 8,544 training samples, 2,210 testing samples, and 1,101 validation samples.
   - **SST-2** is a binary version of SST-1 with only two labels (positive and negative), comprising 6,920 training samples, 1,821 testing samples, and 872 validation samples.

The authors mention that the original English versions of these datasets were translated into Hindi using Google Translate, which is an important detail for understanding the context of the datasets.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **TREC Question Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, X., & Roth, D. (2002). *Learning Question Classifiers*. In Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pages 424-431.

- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**, the citation is:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2013). *Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1631-1642.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset.
