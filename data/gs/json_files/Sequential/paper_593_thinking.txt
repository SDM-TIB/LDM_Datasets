To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spot the Odd Man Out: Exploring the Associative Power of Lexical Resources" by Gabriel Stanovsky and Mark Hopkins, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the Odd-Man-Out task and hints at the creation of datasets for evaluation, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Odd Man Out Datasets)**, where the authors describe the creation of several datasets. Here, they mention two main types of datasets:

1. **ANOMIACOMMON**: This dataset consists of 404 odd-man-out puzzles created from categories in the card game Anomia. The authors explain that they divided this dataset into development and test sets, specifically **ANOMIACOMMONDEV** (202 puzzles for development) and **ANOMIACOMMONTEST** (202 puzzles for testing).

2. **ANOMIAPROPER**: Similar to ANOMIACOMMON, this dataset consists of puzzles based on proper nouns, also divided into development and test sets, namely **ANOMIAPROPERDEV** (202 puzzles for development) and **ANOMIAPROPERTEST** (202 puzzles for testing).

Additionally, the authors mention a crowdsourced dataset called **CROWDSOURCED843**, which contains 843 puzzles validated through a crowdsourcing protocol. This dataset is significant as it was created to ensure high agreement among annotators.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are created by the authors themselves, they may not have external citations. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper:

- **ANOMIACOMMON** and **ANOMIAPROPER** datasets are derived from the card game Anomia, and the authors created them through expert annotation and crowdsourcing.

- **CROWDSOURCED843** is also created by the authors using a crowdsourcing protocol, and it is validated for accuracy.

Since these datasets are original contributions of the authors, I will summarize their details without external citations, as they are not available.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the names and descriptions of each dataset clearly.
