To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Training Deeper Neural Machine Translation Models with Transparent Attention" by Ankur Bapna et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors report results on the **WMT’14 English-German** and **WMT’15 Czech-English** tasks, suggesting that these datasets are used in their experiments.

Next, I will look closely at **section 2.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe their training process. They mention that they train their models on the **WMT’14 En→De dataset** and also evaluate on the **WMT’15 Cs→En dataset**. This confirms that these two datasets are central to their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The WMT datasets are commonly referenced in the field, so I will look for the appropriate citations:

- For the **WMT’14 English-German dataset**, the citation is:
  > Philipp Koehn, Christof Monz, and others. *The 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation: Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-12, 2014.

- For the **WMT’15 Czech-English dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ondřej Bojar, Rajen Chatterjee, Christian Buck, and others. *The 2015 Conference on Machine Translation: Proceedings of the Tenth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT), pages 1-12, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **WMT’14 English-German dataset**
2. **WMT’15 Czech-English dataset**

I will ensure to include the full citations for both datasets as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.
