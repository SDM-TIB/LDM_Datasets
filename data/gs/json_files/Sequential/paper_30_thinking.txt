To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Asking without Telling: Exploring Latent Ontologies in Contextual Representations" by Julian Michael et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experimental setup**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup in **Section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where they outline the tasks and encoders used. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets.

In **Section 4.1 (Tasks)**, the authors mention using the **English Web Treebank part of Universal Dependencies 2.2** for dependencies and the **English portion of Ontonotes 5.0** for other tasks. This indicates that these two datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **English Web Treebank**, the citation is:
   > Silveira, N., Dozat, T., de Marneffe, M.-C., Bowman, S., Connor, M., & Manning, C. D. (2014). A gold standard dependency corpus for English. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’14), pages 2897–2904. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

2. For **Ontonotes 5.0**, the citation is:
   > Weischedel, R., Palmer, M., Marcus, M., Hovy, E., Pradhan, S., Ramshaw, L., & Xue, N. (2013). OntoNotes 5.0: The Linguistic Data Consortium, LDC2013T19. Philadelphia, PA.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
