To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Subword ELMo" by Jiangtong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and references sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss enhancing four benchmark NLP tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) to identify any datasets explicitly mentioned. In section 4.1, the authors state that they evaluate their model on the **One Billion Word dataset**. This is a significant dataset for language modeling, and I need to gather more details about it.

In section 4.2, the authors mention applying their model to four benchmark NLP tasks, but they do not specify additional datasets here. However, they do reference the **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus** for the textual entailment task, which is another important dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **One Billion Word dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ciprian Chelba, Tomas Mikolov, Mike Schuster, Qi Ge, Thorsten Brants, Phillipp Koehn, and Tony Robinson. *One Billion Word Benchmark for Measuring Progress in Statistical Language Modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.3005, 2013.

2. For the **SNLI corpus**, the citation is:
   > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A Large Annotated Corpus for Learning Natural Language Inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2015).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.
