To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Unsupervised Pre-Training and Automated Feature Engineering for Low-Resource Hate Speech Detection in Polish" by Renard Korzeniowski et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses contributions to PolEval 2019 Task 6, which suggests that datasets related to hate speech detection are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention their participation in PolEval 2019 Task 6. I will look for specific mentions of datasets used for training and evaluation. The introduction may provide context about the datasets, but I need to find explicit names and details.

In the **methodology section**, particularly under the subsections discussing ULMFiT and BERT, I will look for any references to datasets used for training language models or for classification tasks. The authors mention using a "huge unlabelled corpus" for training a Polish language model and a "smaller one for classification fine-tuning." I need to identify these datasets clearly.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the PolEval 2018 dataset for language modeling, which is crucial for my extraction.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **PolEval 2018 Dataset**: This dataset was used for training the language model. It is essential for understanding the context of the Polish language model used in their experiments.

2. **PolEval 2019 Task 6 Dataset**: This dataset is the training set provided by the competition organizers for the hate speech detection task. It is crucial for the classification fine-tuning mentioned in the paper.

Next, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets from the references section:

- For the **PolEval 2018 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ogrodniczuk, M., & Kobyliński, Ł. (2018). Proceedings of the PolEval 2018 Workshop, Warsaw, Poland. Institute of Computer Science, Polish Academy of Sciences.

- For the **PolEval 2019 Task 6 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > PolEval 2019 Task 6: Hate Speech and Bullying Detection. Retrieved from http://poleval.pl/tasks/task6.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
