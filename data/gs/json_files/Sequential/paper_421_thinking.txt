To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Team Bertha von Suttner at SemEval-2019 Task 4: Hyperpartisan News Detection using ELMo Sentence Representation Convolutional Network" by Ye Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses participation in a task that involves hyperpartisan news detection, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention two types of datasets: the **by-publisher corpus** and the **by-article corpus**. They provide some details about these datasets, including their sizes and how they were used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** where the authors provide specific details about the datasets. They describe the **by-publisher corpus** as containing 750,000 articles, split into a training set of 600,000 articles and a validation set of 150,000 articles. The **by-article corpus** is mentioned as containing 645 manually labeled articles, and the evaluation was conducted on a separate dataset of 628 manually labeled articles.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the SemEval-2019 Task 4 paper by Kiesel et al. (2019), which provides context for the datasets used in the hyperpartisan news detection task.

The full citation for the datasets is as follows:

- **By-Publisher Corpus**: 
  > Kiesel, J., Mestre, M., Shukla, R., Vincent, E., Adineh, P., Corney, D., Stein, B., & Potthast, M. (2019). SemEval-2019 Task 4: Hyperpartisan News Detection. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2019). Association for Computational Linguistics.

- **By-Article Corpus**: 
  > Kiesel, J., Mestre, M., Shukla, R., Vincent, E., Adineh, P., Corney, D., Stein, B., & Potthast, M. (2019). SemEval-2019 Task 4: Hyperpartisan News Detection. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2019). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Both datasets are part of the same task and thus share the same citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
