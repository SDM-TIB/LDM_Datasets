To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relating Simple Sentence Representations in Deep Neural Networks and the Brain" by Sharmistha Jat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors used MEG brain recording data and a Simple Sentence Corpus, which suggests that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, which is specifically dedicated to describing the datasets used in the study. This section is likely to provide detailed information about each dataset, including their names, purposes, and any relevant characteristics.

In **subsection 2.1 (MEG Dataset)**, the authors describe the MEG datasets used for their experiments. They mention three datasets: 
1. **PassAct1**: Contains 32 sentences with passive and active voice, used for MEG recordings.
2. **PassAct2**: Similar structure with 32 sentences, also focusing on voice.
3. **Act3**: Contains 120 sentences, used for a different aspect of the study.

In **subsection 2.2 (Simple Sentence Corpus)**, the authors describe the Simple Sentence Corpus (SSC), which consists of 256,145 sentences generated from Wikipedia and NELL triples. This dataset is crucial for training deep neural networks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For the **MEG datasets**, the authors reference:
   > Raﬁdi, L. (2014). The role of syntax in semantic processing: A study of active and passive sentences. [Online; accessed 2-March-2019].

2. For the **NELL SVO triples**, the citation is:
   > Talukdar, P. P., Wijaya, D., & Mitchell, T. M. (2012). Acquiring temporal constraints between relations. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM '12), pages 992–1001.

3. The **Wikipedia dataset** does not have a specific citation as it is a publicly available resource, but I will note that it is derived from the 2009 Wikipedia dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
