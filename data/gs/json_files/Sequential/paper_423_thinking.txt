To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TUPA at MRP 2019: A Multi-Task Baseline System" by Daniel Hershcovich and Ofir Arviv, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the TUPA system and its purpose in the shared task on Cross-Framework Meaning Representation Parsing (MRP) at the 2019 CoNLL conference. It does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the TUPA system's capabilities and its performance in various tasks. They reference the UCCA framework and other frameworks but do not provide specific dataset names. I will continue to the methodology and experimental sections for more detailed information.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention that TUPA was trained on multiple frameworks, including UCCA, AMR, DM, PSD, and EDS. However, they do not provide specific dataset names in this section either.

To ensure I capture all relevant datasets, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might indicate datasets used in the experiments. The references may include foundational papers that describe the datasets or provide additional context.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **UCCA (Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation)**: This dataset is referenced in the context of the TUPA system's development and evaluation. The citation for UCCA is:
   > Abend, O., & Rappoport, A. (2013). Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA). In Proceedings of ACL, pages 228–238.

2. **AMR (Abstract Meaning Representation)**: This dataset is also referenced as part of the frameworks supported by TUPA. The citation for AMR is:
   > Banarescu, L., Bonial, C., Cai, S., Georgescu, M., Grifﬁtt, K., Hermjakob, U., Knight, K., Palmer, M., & Schneider, N. (2013). Abstract Meaning Representation for semantic banking. In Proceedings of the Linguistic Annotation Workshop.

3. **DM (DeepBank)**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of the TUPA system's capabilities. The citation for DM is:
   > Flickinger, D., Zhang, Y., & Kordoni, V. (2012). DeepBank: A dynamically annotated treebank of the Wall Street Journal. In Proceedings of Workshop on Treebanks and Linguistic Theories, pages 85–96.

4. **PSD (Prague Semantic Dependencies)**: This dataset is referenced in relation to the frameworks supported by TUPA. The citation for PSD is:
   > Hajic, J., Hajicová, E., Panevová, J., Sgall, P., Bojar, O., Cinková, S., Fucíková, E., Mikulová, M., Pajas, P., & Popelka, J. (2012). Announcing Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0. In LREC, pages 3153–3160.

5. **EDS (Elementary Dependency Structures)**: This dataset is also mentioned in the context of the TUPA system. The citation for EDS is:
   > Oepen, S., & Lønning, J. T. (2006). Discriminant-based MRS banking. In LREC, pages 1250–1255.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and full citation to ensure clarity and proper attribution.
