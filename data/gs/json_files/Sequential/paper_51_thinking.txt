To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Learning with Contextual Embeddings for Zero-resource Cross-lingual Classification and NER" by Phillip Keung et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions improvements on the **multilingual MLDoc text classification** and **CoNLL 2002/2003 named entity recognition tasks**, indicating that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors refer to the **XNLI dataset** as a multilingual dataset used for zero-resource cross-lingual classification. This is a clear indication that I need to gather more information about this dataset.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experiments in detail. They mention using the **MLDoc corpus** for text classification, specifically the **english.train.1000** dataset, which contains 1000 labeled documents. They also refer to the **CoNLL 2002/2003 NER corpus** for named entity recognition tasks.

In the **results section**, they provide performance metrics for both the MLDoc and CoNLL datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. For the **MLDoc dataset**, the citation is:
   > Holger Schwenk and Xian Li. *A corpus for multilingual document classification in eight languages*. In Proceedings of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC), 2018.

2. For the **CoNLL 2002/2003 NER corpus**, the citation is:
   > Erik F. Sang and Fien De Meulder. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), 2003.

3. For the **XNLI dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alexis Conneau, Guillaume Lample, Ruty Rinott, Adina Williams, Samuel R. Bowman, Holger Schwenk, and Veselin Stoyanov. *XNLI: Evaluating cross-lingual sentence representations*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2018.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
