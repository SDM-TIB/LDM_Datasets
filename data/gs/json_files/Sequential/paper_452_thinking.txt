To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CRNN: A Joint Neural Network for Redundancy Detection" by Xinyu Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors compare their framework against state-of-the-art text classification algorithms on four popular benchmarking corpuses, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Evaluation)**, particularly **subsection 4.2 (Data and Pre-processing)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **Google-news**: A small portion of excerpts from the Google news channel.
2. **Twenty-news-groups**: A dataset originating from the publishers of the newspaper "twenty-news-groups."
3. **Brown Corpus**: A standard corpus of American English texts created by Francis and Kucera in the 1960s.
4. **Question Classification**: A dataset created by Li and Roth containing 50 classes of texts.

In this section, the authors provide a brief description of each dataset, including its characteristics and size, which is essential for understanding their context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Google-news**, the citation is:
  > M. Karkali, F. Rousseau, A. Ntoulas, and M. Vazirgiannis. "Using temporal idf for efficient novelty detection in text streams." arXiv preprint arXiv:1401.1456, 2014.

- For **Twenty-news-groups**, the citation is:
  > K. Lang. "Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews." In Proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference on Machine Learning, 1995, pp. 331–339.

- For **Brown Corpus**, the citation is:
  > W. N. Francis and H. Kucera. "The brown corpus: A standard corpus of present-day edited American English." Providence, RI: Department of Linguistics, Brown University [producer and distributor], 1979.

- For **Question Classification**, the citation is:
  > X. Li and D. Roth. "Learning question classifiers." In Proceedings of the 19th international conference on Computational linguistics-Volume 1. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2002, pp. 1–7.

With this information gathered, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their full citations, and prepare to format them according to the required structure for further processing.
