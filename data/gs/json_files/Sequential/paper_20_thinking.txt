To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Question Generation from Paragraphs: A Tale of Two Hierarchical Models" by Vishwajeet Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting empirical evaluation on the **SQuAD** and **MS MARCO** datasets, which indicates that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, they state that:

1. **SQuAD Dataset**: This dataset contains 536 Wikipedia articles and over 100,000 questions posed about these articles by crowd-workers. The authors mention splitting the SQuAD train set into a training and development set for evaluation purposes.

2. **MS MARCO Dataset**: This dataset consists of passages retrieved from web documents, with questions that are anonymized versions of BING queries. The authors specify that they used a subset of the MS MARCO v1.1 dataset containing questions answerable from at least one paragraph, and they also describe their method of splitting the dataset into training and development sets.

To ensure accuracy, I will check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets:

- For the **SQuAD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383â€“2392, 2016.

- For the **MS MARCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.09268, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
