To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HumorHawk at SemEval-2017 Task 6: Mixing Meaning and Sound for Humor Recognition" by David Donahue, Alexey Romanov, and Anna Rumshisky, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the system utilizes tweets from the @midnight show #HashtagWars, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the #HashtagWars dataset. They mention that this dataset is used for humor detection and that it is large in size, making it suitable for deep learning techniques. This is a strong indication that I need to extract details about this dataset.

In the **system description section**, the authors provide more context about the dataset used for their experiments. They specifically mention that they participated in subtask A of SemEval-2017 Task 6, which involved tweets from the #HashtagWars segment. This confirms the dataset's relevance to their work.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors refer to the dataset in the context of their model evaluations. However, the primary dataset appears to be the #HashtagWars dataset.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the #HashtagWars dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the #HashtagWars dataset, the citation is:
  > Peter Potash, Alexey Romanov, and Anna Rumshisky. *#HashtagWars: Learning a Sense of Humor*. In Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2017), pages 98â€“102, Vancouver, Canada, August 3 - 4, 2017. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for output, ensuring it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
