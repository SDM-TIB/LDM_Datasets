To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Sentence Representations for Propaganda Detection: From Handcrafted Features to Word Embeddings" by André Ferreira Cruz et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the **NLP4IF shared task on propaganda detection**, which indicates that they likely used a specific dataset for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to data sources.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (System Description)**, particularly the **data pre-processing and feature selection** subsections. Here, the authors mention that the provided train dataset consists of **350 articles** with a total of **16,965 sentences**, including **4,720 labeled as propaganda** and **12,245 labeled as non-propaganda**. This dataset is crucial for understanding their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset used in the NLP4IF shared task. The authors cite the work by Da San Martino et al. (2019), which is likely the source of the dataset they utilized.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Giovanni Da San Martino, Seunghak Yu, Alberto Barrón-Cedeño, Rostislav Petrov, and Preslav Nakov. *Fine-grained analysis of propaganda in news articles*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019, Hong Kong, China.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Dataset Name**: NLP4IF Shared Task Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of 350 articles with a total of 16,965 sentences, where 4,720 sentences are labeled as propaganda and 12,245 as non-propaganda.
   - **Citation**: Giovanni Da San Martino, Seunghak Yu, Alberto Barrón-Cedeño, Rostislav Petrov, and Preslav Nakov. *Fine-grained analysis of propaganda in news articles*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019, Hong Kong, China.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
