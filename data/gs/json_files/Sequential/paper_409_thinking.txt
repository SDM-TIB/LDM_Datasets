To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Retrofitting Contextualized Word Embeddings with Paraphrases" by Weijia Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments that show improvements on various tasks, which suggests that datasets were used, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus)**: This dataset contains 2,753 paraphrase pairs and is used for paraphrase identification tasks.

2. **Sampled Quora**: This dataset consists of 20,000 randomly sampled paraphrased question pairs, which is referenced as being from Iyer et al. (2017).

3. **PAN (Paraphrase and Non-Paraphrase Dataset)**: This dataset includes 5,000 paraphrase pairs and is cited from Madnani et al. (2012).

I will also check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MRPC**, the citation is:
  > Bill Dolan, Chris Quirk, and Chris Brockett. *Unsupervised construction of large paraphrase corpora: Exploiting massively parallel news sources*. In COLING, 2004.

- For **Sampled Quora**, the citation is:
  > Shankar Iyer, Nikhil Dandekar, and KornÃ©l Csernai. *First quora dataset release: Question pairs*. data.quora.com, 2017.

- For **PAN**, the citation is:
  > Nitin Madnani, Joel Tetreault, and Martin Chodorow. *Re-examining machine translation metrics for paraphrase identification*. In NAACL, 2012.

After collecting this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset names, descriptions, and their respective citations. This will allow me to compile a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the paper, which can be formatted for further processing or review.
