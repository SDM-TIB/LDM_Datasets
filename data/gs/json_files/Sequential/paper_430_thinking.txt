To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Feasibility of Embedding Based Automatic Evaluation for Single Document Summarization" by Simeng Sun and Ani Nenkova, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on using distributed representations for evaluating summarizers, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors mention validating their method on three different test sets with human evaluation. This indicates that specific datasets are used for their experiments.

In the **Evaluation on DUC2001/2002 section**, the authors explicitly mention using the **Document Understanding Conferences (DUC) 2001 and 2002** datasets. They describe these datasets as benchmark datasets that provide human evaluation over multiple submitted systems. 

Additionally, in the **Evaluation on Newsroom section**, the authors refer to the **Newsroom dataset**, which consists of 1.3 million summaries with diverse extractive strategies. This dataset is crucial for their experiments on contemporary data and systems.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **DUC2001** and **DUC2002**, the citation is:
   > Lin, C.-Y., & Hovy, E. (2003). Automatic evaluation of summaries using n-gram co-occurrence statistics. In Proceedings of the Human Language Technology Conference of the NAACL, Main Conference, pages 403-410.

2. For the **Newsroom dataset**, the citation is:
   > Grusky, M., Naaman, M., & Artzi, Y. (2018). Newsroom: A dataset of 1.3 million summaries with diverse extractive strategies. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 708-719. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
