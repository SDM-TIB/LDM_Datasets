To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NL-FIIT at IEST-2018: Emotion Recognition utilizing Neural Networks and Multi-level Preprocessing" by Samuel Pecar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a shared task on implicit emotion recognition, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide specific details about the dataset used for the emotion recognition task. Here, they describe the dataset as consisting of tweets with the emotion word removed, categorized into six different emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise. They mention that the training dataset contains approximately 150,000 tweets and the test dataset contains over 30,000 tweets. This section confirms the existence of a dataset relevant to their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to the main paper of the shared task for detailed information about the dataset, which is authored by Klinger et al. (2018). Therefore, I will extract the citation for this reference.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Klinger, R., de Clercq, O., Mohammad, S. M., & Balahur, A. (2018). IEST: WASSA-2018 implicit emotions shared task. In Proceedings of the 9th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, I have identified the dataset used in the paper, described its contents, and retrieved the necessary citation. This will allow me to present the dataset information clearly and accurately.
