To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Evaluating Coherence in Dialogue Systems using Entailment" by Nouha Dziri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and I will look for any references to datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Inference Corpus for Dialogues)**, where the authors describe the construction of their synthesized dataset. Here, they mention the **Persona-Chat corpus** as the foundational dataset for creating their inference data. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and how it was utilized in their research.

In this section, the authors also introduce their own dataset called **InferConvAI**, which is synthesized from the Persona-Chat corpus. I will extract the relevant details about InferConvAI, including its size and the types of labels it contains (entailment, contradiction, neutral).

After gathering information about the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both the Persona-Chat corpus and the MultiNLI corpus, which is also mentioned in the context of constructing contradictory instances for the InferConvAI dataset.

The citations I need to retrieve are:

1. For the **Persona-Chat corpus**:
   > Zhang, S., Dinan, E., Urbanek, J., Szlam, A., Kiela, D., & Weston, J. (2018). *Personalizing dialogue agents: I have a dog, do you have pets too?* arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.07243.

2. For the **MultiNLI corpus**:
   > Williams, A., Nangia, N., & Bowman, S. (2018). *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1112â€“1122.

Now, I will compile the extracted information about each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow me to present a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
