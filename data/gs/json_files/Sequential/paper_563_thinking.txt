To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lexical Substitution for Evaluating Compositional Distributional Models" by Maja Buljan, Sebastian Padó, and Jan Šnajder, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a lexical substitution dataset for evaluating Compositional Distributional Semantic Models (CDSMs), which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (The ANVAN-LS Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset is constructed from the English CoInCo corpus, which consists of roughly 2,500 sentences with manually annotated lexical substitutes. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's structure and purpose.

The authors specify that the ANVAN-LS dataset maintains an adjective-noun-verb-adjective-noun (ANVAN) format and includes 165 phrases with an average of 4.4 target words per phrase. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance and utility for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CoInCo corpus, as it is the source of the ANVAN-LS dataset. The citation for the CoInCo corpus is:
> Kremer, K., Erk, K., Padó, S., & Thater, S. (2014). What substitutes tell us: analysis of an “all-words” lexical substitution corpus. In Proceedings of EACL (pp. 540–549).

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

The dataset entry will include:
1. **Dataset Name**: ANVAN-LS
2. **Description**: A lexical substitution dataset constructed from the CoInCo corpus, featuring 165 phrases in an ANVAN format with annotated lexical substitutes.
3. **Citation**: Kremer, K., Erk, K., Padó, S., & Thater, S. (2014). What substitutes tell us: analysis of an “all-words” lexical substitution corpus. In Proceedings of EACL (pp. 540–549).

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
