To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation of vector embedding models in clustering of text documents" by Tomasz Walkowiak and Mateusz Gniewkowski, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors performed experiments on two corpora of texts in Polish, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention two specific collections:

1. **Press Corpus**: This dataset comprises Polish press news, categorized into five subject categories, with a total of approximately 6,500 documents. The authors reference a previous study that reported a 95.5% accuracy on this dataset in supervised classification.

2. **Reviews Corpus**: This dataset consists of reviews of scientific works from 21 different science areas, containing around 10,500 documents. The authors note that fastText achieved a 90.7% accuracy on this dataset in supervised classification.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or models mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are not attributed to specific papers but rather described in the context of the authors' experiments.

Since the datasets are not formally published in the same way as traditional datasets, I will still provide a clear description of each dataset along with the citation for the paper itself, as it is the source of the dataset information.

The full citation for the paper is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with the necessary details and citations for further processing.
