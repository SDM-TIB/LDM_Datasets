To extract datasets from the research paper titled "YUN-HPCC at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Multi-Step Ensemble Neural Network for Sentiment Analysis in Textual Conversation" by Dawei Li, Jin Wang, and Xuejie Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a multi-step ensemble strategy for emotion detection in Twitter conversations, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors reference "SemEval 2019 Task 3, EmoContext: Contextual Emotion Detection in Text" and discuss the challenges of data imbalance. This indicates that they are likely using a specific dataset related to this task.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any explicit mention of datasets. The authors state that datasets were provided by SemEval 2019 Task 3, and they specify the number of training and development sets: 30,160 for training and 2,755 for development. They also mention the emotion categories: happy, sad, angry, and others. This section is crucial as it confirms the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the dataset used in this paper is:

- For the **EmoContext dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ankush Chatterjee, Kedhar Nath Narahari, Meghana Joshi, and Puneet Agrawal. *SemEval-2019 Task 3: EmoContext: Contextual Emotion Detection in Text*. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and accurate.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
