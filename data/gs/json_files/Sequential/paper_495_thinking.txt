To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What Does This Word Mean? Explaining Contextualized Embeddings with Natural Language Definition" by Ting-Yun Chang and Yun-Nung Chen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyze contextualized word embeddings and mention using the **online Oxford dictionary dataset** released by Chang et al. (2018). This suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss their focus on whether contextualized embeddings can indicate corresponding sense definitions. They mention training and evaluating their model on the Oxford dictionary dataset, which confirms its relevance.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their approach to mapping contextualized embeddings to definitions, but they do not introduce any new datasets here. Instead, they reiterate the use of the Oxford dictionary dataset.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail their evaluation tasks, including the **Seen** and **Unseen** tasks, but they do not introduce any additional datasets. They primarily focus on the performance of their model using the Oxford dictionary dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Oxford dictionary dataset mentioned. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Oxford dictionary dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ting-Yun Chang, Ta-Chung Chi, Shang-Chi Tsai, and Yun-Nung Chen. *xSense: Learning sense-separated sparse representations and textual definitions for explainable word sense networks*. arXiv preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03348, 2018.

Since the paper primarily discusses the use of this single dataset, I will summarize it as follows:

1. **Oxford Dictionary Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluating the model to analyze whether contextualized embeddings can indicate corresponding sense definitions.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
