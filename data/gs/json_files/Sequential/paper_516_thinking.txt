To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural Language Generation for Effective Knowledge Distillation" by Raphael Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their approach on **four datasets in sentiment classification, sentence similarity, and linguistic acceptability**, which suggests that specific datasets will be listed.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four datasets:

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank-2 (SST-2)**: This dataset is described as a binary polarity dataset of single-sentence movie reviews.
   
2. **Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA)**: This dataset is a single-sentence grammaticality task with expertly annotated binary judgments.

3. **Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B)**: This dataset comprises sentence pairs labeled with real-valued similarity scores between 1 and 5.

4. **Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC)**: This dataset contains sentence pairs with binary labels denoting semantic equivalence.

The authors also mention that they selected these datasets from the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark, which provides additional context for their selection.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Stanford Sentiment Treebank-2 (SST-2)**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2013.

- For **Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA)**, the citation is:
  > Alex Warstadt, Amanpreet Singh, and Samuel R. Bowman. *Neural network acceptability judgments*. arXiv:1805.12471, 2018.

- For **Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B)**, the citation is:

  > William B. Dolan and Chris Brockett. *Automatically constructing a corpus of sentential paraphrases*. In Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Paraphrasing (IWP2005), 2005.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
