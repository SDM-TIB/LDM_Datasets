To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEx BiST: A Multi-Source Trainable Parser with Deep Contextualized Lexical Representations" by KyungTae Lim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the parser was developed for the CoNLL 2018 Shared Task, which suggests that datasets related to this task might be included.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss multilingual parsing and reference the CoNLL shared tasks, which typically involve various annotated corpora. This is a good indication that datasets are present.

In the **implementation details and results sections**, I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that list the corpora used for training and evaluation. The paper mentions training on Universal Dependency 2.2 corpora, which is a significant dataset in the field of dependency parsing.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors may refer to specific papers or resources that describe the datasets they used.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Universal Dependencies 2.2**: This dataset is used for training the parser and is crucial for multilingual dependency parsing. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Zeman, Daniel, Filip Ginter, Jan Hajič, Joakim Nivre, Martin Popel, Milan Straka, and et al. *CoNLL 2018 Shared Task: Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies*. In Proceedings of the CoNLL 2018 Shared Task: Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies, pages 1–20, 2018.

2. **CoNLL 2018 Shared Task Data**: This dataset includes various corpora used in the shared task. The citation is:
   > Zeman, Daniel, Jan Hajič, Martin Popel, Martin Potthast, Milan Straka, Filip Ginter, Joakim Nivre, and Slav Petrov. *CoNLL 2018 Shared Task: Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies*. In Proceedings of the CoNLL 2018 Shared Task: Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies, Association for Computational Linguistics, Brussels, Belgium, pages 1–20, 2018.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
