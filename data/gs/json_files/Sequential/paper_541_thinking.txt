To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Jiangnan at SemEval-2018 Task 11: Deep Neural Network with Attention Method for Machine Comprehension Task" by Jiangnan Xia, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a deep neural network model for a machine comprehension task, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

In the **introduction**, the author references several MRC datasets, specifically mentioning the **Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)** and the **Microsoft MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset (MS-MARCO)**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to the research.

Next, I will look at **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the author provides statistics about the datasets used. The paper states that there are official training, development, and test datasets, but it does not specify their names in this section. However, since the introduction already mentioned SQuAD and MS-MARCO, I will assume these are the datasets being referred to.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For **Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)**, the citation is:
   > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.05250, 2016.

2. For **Microsoft MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset (MS-MARCO)**, the citation is:
   > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.09268, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
