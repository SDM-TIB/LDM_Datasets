To extract datasets from the research paper titled "context2vec: Learning Generic Context Embedding with Bidirectional LSTM" by Oren Melamud et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the context representations and mentions that the authors release their code and pretrained models, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **evaluation settings** section, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for different tasks:

1. **Microsoft Sentence Completion Challenge (MSCC)**: This dataset is used for the sentence completion task. The authors state that it includes 1,040 items, each with a sentence containing a gap to fill. They also mention the learning corpus associated with this dataset.

2. **Lexical Substitution Datasets**: The authors refer to two datasets for the lexical substitution task:
   - **SemEval 2007 Lexical Substitution Dataset (LST-07)**: This dataset consists of 300 development sentences and 1,710 test sentences.
   - **All-Words Lexical Substitution Dataset (LST-14)**: This dataset contains over 15,000 target word instances, with a predefined 35%/65% split for development and testing.

3. **Senseval-3 Lexical Sample Dataset (SE-3)**: This dataset is used for supervised word sense disambiguation tasks, containing 7,860 training instances and 3,944 test instances.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for are:
- For the **Microsoft Sentence Completion Challenge (MSCC)**, I will refer to the technical report by Zweig and Burges (2011).
- For the **SemEval 2007 Lexical Substitution Dataset (LST-07)**, I will look for the paper by McCarthy and Navigli (2007).
- For the **All-Words Lexical Substitution Dataset (LST-14)**, I will find the paper by Kremer et al. (2014).
- For the **Senseval-3 Lexical Sample Dataset (SE-3)**, I will refer to the paper by Mihalcea et al. (2004).

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
