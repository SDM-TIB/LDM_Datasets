To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Sentiment of Polish Language Short Texts" by Aleksander Wawer and Julita Sobiczewska, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors use various Polish language datasets for sentiment analysis, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data Sets)**, which is explicitly dedicated to describing the datasets used in the experiments. This section is likely to contain the most comprehensive information about each dataset, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about their usage.

In **subsection 2.1 (Polish Sentiment Treebank)**, the authors describe the Polish Sentiment Treebank (TW) and its versions. They mention that it is a dependency treebank with sentiment annotations, and they provide details about its initial and updated versions. I will note the specifics of both versions, including their intended use and the types of sentences included.

In **subsection 2.2 (Twitter Data)**, the authors describe a dataset of Polish tweets that were manually labeled for sentiment. I will extract the key details about this dataset, including its size and the context of the tweets.

In **subsection 2.3 (Movie Reviews)**, the authors discuss a dataset of movie reviews collected from a Polish website. I will capture the characteristics of this dataset, including the number of reviews and how the sentiment labels were assigned.

After gathering the necessary information from these sections, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The citations I will look for include:

1. For the **Polish Sentiment Treebank (TW)**, I will find the original paper or source that describes the dataset.
2. For the **Twitter Data**, I will check if there is a specific reference to the TrendMiner project or any related publication.
3. For the **Movie Reviews**, I will look for the source that details the dataset collection from the filmweb.pl website.

Once I have all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset descriptions, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

This structured approach will help me systematically extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, ensuring that I do not miss any important details or citations.
