To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Syntactic and Semantic Information in Word Embeddings using Graph Convolutional Networks" by Shikhar Vashishth et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed methods on various tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors mention using the **Wikipedia corpus** for training their models. This is a significant dataset, and I will note its details. Additionally, they refer to several intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, which may involve other datasets.

I will also check the **evaluation method section** for any specific datasets used for the intrinsic tasks, such as:

1. **Simlex-999**: A dataset for evaluating semantic similarity.
2. **WS353**: A dataset for word similarity tasks.
3. **AP**: A dataset for concept categorization.
4. **MSR**: A dataset for word analogy tasks.
5. **CoNLL-2003**: A dataset for named entity recognition.
6. **SQuAD**: A dataset for question answering.
7. **Penn Treebank**: A dataset for part-of-speech tagging.
8. **CoNLL-2012**: A dataset for coreference resolution.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

For example, I will look for citations like:
- For **Simlex-999**, the citation is:
  > Hill, F., Reichart, R., & Korhonen, A. (2015). Simlex-999: Evaluating semantic models with genuine similarity estimation. *Computational Linguistics*, 41(4), 665-695.

- For **WS353**, the citation is:
  > Finkelstein, L., Gabrilovich, E., Matias, Y., Rivlin, E., Solan, Z., Wolfman, G., & Ruppin, E. (2001). Placing search in context: The concept revisited. In *Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on World Wide Web* (WWW '01), 406-414.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
