To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Attentive Sentence-Pair Modeling via Distilled Sentence Embedding" by Oren Barkan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on five GLUE sentence-pair tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup and Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they list the following datasets from the GLUE benchmark:

1. **MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus)**: This dataset is used for paraphrase identification and consists of sentence pairs labeled as paraphrases or not. The citation for MRPC is:
   > Dolan, W. B., & Brockett, C. (2005). Automatically constructing a corpus of sentential paraphrases. In IWP@IJCNLP.

2. **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is a natural language inference benchmark that includes sentence pairs labeled as entailment, contradiction, or neutral. The citation for MNLI is:
   > Williams, A., Nangia, N., & Bowman, S. R. (2017). A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.05426.

3. **QQP (Quora Question Pairs)**: This dataset consists of pairs of questions from Quora, labeled as duplicates or not. The citation for QQP is:
   > Wang, A., Singh, A., Michael, J., Hill, F., Levy, O., & Bowman, S. R. (2018). Glue: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.07461.

4. **QNLI (Question Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is derived from the SQuAD dataset and is used for question answering tasks. The citation for QNLI is:
   > Wang, A., Singh, A., Michael, J., Hill, F., Levy, O., & Bowman, S. R. (2018). Glue: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.07461.

5. **STS-B (Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark)**: This dataset is used for evaluating the semantic similarity of sentence pairs. The citation for STS-B is:
   > Cer, D., Diab, M., Agirre, E., Lopez-Gazpio, I., & Lucia, S. (2017). SemEval-2017 task 1: Semantic textual similarity multilingual and crosslingual focused evaluation. In Proceedings of SemEval-2017, pages 1â€“14.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their respective citations accurately as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for further processing or review.
