To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Opinion Mining with Deep Contextualized Embeddings" by Wen-Bin Han and Noriko Kando, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses opinion expression detection and mentions the use of different datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Data Sets)**, where the author explicitly lists the datasets used in the experiments. Here, I find two datasets mentioned:

1. **MPQA 1.2**: This dataset is used for opinion expression detection and includes two types of opinion expressions: direct subjective expressions (DSEs) and expressive subjective expressions (ESEs). The paper states that it was processed and provided by Irsoy and Cardie (2014).

2. **NTCIR7-MOAT**: This dataset is related to opinion expression and is organized by NTCIR, as referenced by Seki et al. (2008).

In this section, the author provides a brief description of each dataset, including the number of sentences for each type of expression in MPQA 1.2 and the total number of sentences in the NTCIR7-MOAT dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MPQA 1.2**, the citation is:
  > Omer Irsoy and Claire Cardie. *Opinion mining with deep recurrent neural networks*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 720â€“728, 2014.

- For **NTCIR7-MOAT**, the citation is:
  > Yohei Seki, David Kirk Evans, Lun-Wei Ku, Le Sun, Hsin-Hsi Chen, and Noriko Kando. *Overview of multilingual opinion analysis task at ntcir-7*. Proceedings of The IEEE - PIEEE, 2008.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
