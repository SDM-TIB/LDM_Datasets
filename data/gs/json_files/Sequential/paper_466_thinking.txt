To extract datasets from the research paper titled "YNU Deep at SemEval-2018 Task 11: An Ensemble of Attention-based BiLSTM Models for Machine Comprehension" by Peng Ding and Xiaobing Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in a task related to machine comprehension, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for their experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of machine comprehension and reference various models and datasets used in the field. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe their data processing methods and mention that the organizers provided training, development, and test sets containing 9837, 1417, and 2797 questions, respectively. This indicates that they used a specific dataset for their experiments, but the name of the dataset is not provided in this section.

To find the dataset's name, I will look for any references to external datasets in the **references section**. The authors mention the CNN/Daily Mail dataset in the introduction, which is a well-known dataset for machine comprehension tasks. 

Now, I will retrieve the full citation for the CNN/Daily Mail dataset from the references section:

- For the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**, the citation is:
  > Danqi Chen, Jason Bolton, and Christopher D Manning. *The CNN/Daily Mail Reading Comprehension Task*. In Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), volume 1, pages 2358â€“2367, 2016.

Additionally, the authors mention using GloVe and Word2Vec for word embeddings, but these are not datasets in the traditional sense; they are tools for generating word representations.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
