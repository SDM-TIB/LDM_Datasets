To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse Victory â€“ A Large Scale Systematic Comparison of Count-Based and Prediction-Based Vectorizers for Text Classification" by Rupak Chakraborty et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors studied the performance of several text vectorization algorithms on a collection of **73 publicly available datasets**, which suggests that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **Data & Model Details section** (Section 2), where the authors describe the datasets they collected. They mention that the datasets are grouped into **8 categories**: emotion, sentiment, reviews, medical, general classification, news, spam-fake-hate-ironic, and other. This categorization provides a structured way to identify the datasets.

The authors also provide a **table (Table 1)** that summarizes the number of datasets in each category, which confirms the presence of multiple datasets. However, I need to find the specific names and details of these datasets.

I will look for any links or references to the datasets in the paper. The authors mention a link to the datasets: **http://tinyurl.com/yyofx77r**. I will assume this link leads to a repository or a list of the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any specific datasets are cited. However, the paper primarily discusses the datasets in a general sense without providing individual citations for each dataset. Since the authors have curated and standardized these datasets, they may not have specific citations for each one.

Given that the paper emphasizes the collection of datasets from various online sources like Kaggle, Crowdflower, and UCI repository, I will note that these sources may contain the datasets referenced in the study.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets, including the categories and the total number of datasets in each category, but I will not be able to provide full citations for individual datasets since they are not explicitly listed in the paper.

In summary, I will extract the following information:

1. **Total number of datasets**: 73
2. **Categories of datasets**:
   - Sentiment: 16 datasets
   - Emotion: 2 datasets
   - Reviews: 7 datasets
   - Medical: 10 datasets
   - General Classification: 17 datasets
   - News: 8 datasets
   - Spam-Fake-Hate-Ironic: 6 datasets
   - Other: 7 datasets

I will note that while the paper does not provide specific citations for each dataset, it does indicate that the datasets are publicly available and can be accessed through the provided link. This will be important for anyone looking to reproduce the results or further explore the datasets used in this study.
