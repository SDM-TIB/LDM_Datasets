To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fermi at SemEval-2019 Task 6: Identifying and Categorizing Offensive Language in Social Media using Sentence Embeddings" by Vijayasaradhi Indurthi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions participation in "all the three sub-tasks within Task 6," which suggests that there are datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of identifying offensive language in social media, but I need to look for specific dataset names. The **methodology section** provides insights into the techniques used, but I will focus on the **dataset section** for explicit mentions.

In **section 4 (Dataset)**, the authors describe the dataset used for the OffensEval task. They mention that the dataset consists of 14,100 posts and is divided into three sub-tasks:

1. **Sub-task A**: Offensive language detection, classifying posts as offensive (OFF) vs. not offensive (NOT).
2. **Sub-task B**: Categorization of offensive language into targeted (TIN) and untargeted (UNT).
3. **Sub-task C**: Offensive language target identification, categorizing targets as individual (IND), group (GRP), and other (OTH).

The dataset is referenced as being described in the work of Zampieri et al. (2019), which indicates that I need to look for the full citation of this dataset in the **References section**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the complete citation for the dataset:

- For the dataset used in OffensEval, the citation is:
  > Marcos Zampieri, Shervin Malmasi, Preslav Nakov, Sara Rosenthal, Noura Farra, and Ritesh Kumar. *Predicting the Type and Target of Offensive Posts in Social Media*. In Proceedings of NAACL, 2019.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as required. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
