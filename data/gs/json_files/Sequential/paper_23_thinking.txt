To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Context is Key: Grammatical Error Detection with Contextual Word Representations" by Samuel Bell et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors perform a systematic comparison on a range of public GED datasets, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference several previous works that utilized specific datasets for grammatical error detection (GED). However, I need to find the exact datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets they used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **First Certificate in English (FCE) dataset**: This dataset consists of essays written by non-native learners of English, annotated with spans of language errors, types of errors, and suggested corrections. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Yannakoudakis, H., Andersen, Ø. E., Geranpayeh, A., Briscoe, T., & Nicholls, D. (2011). A new dataset and method for automatically grading ESOL texts. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 180–189.

2. **CoNLL 2014 shared task dataset**: This dataset includes English essays written by advanced undergraduate students at the National University of Singapore, annotated by two experienced annotators. The citation is:
   > Ng, H. T., Wu, S. M., Briscoe, T., Hadiwinoto, C., Susanto, R. H., & Bryant, C. (2014). The CoNLL-2014 shared task on grammatical error correction. In Proceedings of the Eighteenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning: Shared Task, pages 1–14.

3. **JFLEG dataset**: The Johns Hopkins University FLuency-Extended GUG Corpus contains essays written by English learners, annotated with fluency and grammar edits by four annotators. The citation is:
   > Napoles, C., Sakaguchi, K., & Tetreault, J. (2017). JFLEG: A fluency corpus and benchmark for grammatical error correction. In Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 229–234.

4. **Cambridge English Write & Improve (W&I) corpus**: This dataset consists of texts written by learners of English submitted for assessment to the Write & Improve system. The citation is:
   > Yannakoudakis, H., Felice, M., & Briscoe, T. (2018). Developing an automated writing placement system for ESL learners. Applied Measurement in Education, 31(3), 251–267.

5. **LOCNESS corpus**: This corpus comprises essays written by native English students, originally compiled at the Centre for English Corpus Linguistics. The citation is:
   > Granger, S. (1998). The computer learner corpus: A versatile new source of data for SLA research. In Learner English on Computer, pages 3–18. Addison Wesley Longman: London & New York.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile their full citations accurately as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy access and review.
