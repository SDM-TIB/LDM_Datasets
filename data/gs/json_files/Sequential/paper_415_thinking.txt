To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Code Completion using Neural Attention and Byte Pair Encoding" by Youri Arkesteijn et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data acquisition sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction discusses the context and importance of code completion, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Data Acquisition and Generation)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention using the **SRI labâ€™s 150k Python Dataset** as the basis for their prediction task. This is a clear indication that a specific dataset is being utilized.

I will then look for any additional details about the dataset in this section. The authors describe how they processed the Python files from the dataset, which confirms its relevance to their experiments. They also provide a link to the dataset, which is useful for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **150k Python Dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> SRI International. *150k Python Dataset*. Available at: https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/py150.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review, ensuring that it is clear and complete, ready for any downstream processing or documentation needs.
