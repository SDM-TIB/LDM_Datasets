To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Detection of Adverse Drug Reaction mentions in tweets using ELMo" by Sarah Sarabadani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the author refers to the use of tweets for detecting Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, in the **introduction**, the author states that they were provided with **25,672 tweets** (2,374 positive and 23,298 negative) for task 1, and a subset of **2,367 tweets** (1,212 positive and 1,155 negative) for task 2. This indicates that these tweets form the basis of the dataset used in their experiments.

In the **methods section**, the author elaborates on the preprocessing and modeling techniques applied to these tweets, but does not introduce any additional datasets. The focus remains on the provided tweets.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset of tweets used. Instead, it references other works that discuss mining Twitter for drug-related adverse events, which may not be direct citations for the dataset itself.

The relevant references that mention Twitter mining and could be associated with the dataset are:

Since the paper does not provide a formal dataset citation, I will note the number of tweets and their classification as the dataset description.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, including the number of tweets and their classification, along with the relevant citations from the references section. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
