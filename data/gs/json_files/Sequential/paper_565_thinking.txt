To extract datasets from the research paper titled "JU ETCE 17 21 at SemEval-2019 Task 6: Efficient Machine Learning and Neural Network Approaches for Identifying and Categorizing Offensive Language in Tweets" by Mainak Pal et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates participation in the SemEval 2019 shared task, which suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find specific details.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Methodology and Data)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention that the organizers provided a dataset of **13,240 tweets** annotated with categories for offensive language identification, categorization of offense types, and offense target identification. This is a clear indication of the dataset being utilized.

I will also look for any references to the dataset's source or citation. The authors refer to the data collection methods used in OffensEval, which is described in Zampieri et al. (2019a). This is crucial as it points to the original source of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the OffensEval dataset is:
> Marcos Zampieri, Shervin Malmasi, Preslav Nakov, Sara Rosenthal, Noura Farra, and Ritesh Kumar. *Predicting the Type and Target of Offensive Posts in Social Media*. In Proceedings of NAACL, 2019.

Additionally, I will note that the paper mentions the use of various machine learning and deep learning approaches, but the dataset itself is primarily the one provided by the organizers for the shared task.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent analysis or processing of the dataset.
