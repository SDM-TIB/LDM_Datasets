To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent Variable Sentiment Grammar" by Liwen Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research. The introduction may provide additional context or details about the dataset's significance in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** within the paper. In this case, I find that **section 5 (Experiments)** explicitly states that the authors used the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)** for their experiments. This section will likely contain details about how the dataset was utilized, including any specific configurations or splits used for training and testing.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the SST dataset, noting that it contains manually assigned sentiment polarities for each constituent node in a phrase-structured tree. They mention that the dataset is used for both binary classification (SST-2) and fine-grained classification (SST-5). This information is essential for understanding the dataset's application in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Stanford Sentiment Treebank. The citation is as follows:
> Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631â€“1642, 2013.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification tasks, containing sentiment labels for phrases in a tree structure.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or analysis.
