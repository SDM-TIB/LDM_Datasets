To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Figure Eight at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Ensemble of Transfer Learning Methods for Contextual Emotion Detection" by Joan Xiao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and task overview sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods used, but I need to look for specific dataset details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of contextual emotion detection and reference previous SemEval tasks, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. 

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Task Overview)**, particularly **subsection 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset provided by the organizers. They mention that the dataset consists of a training, development, and test set, with each entry being a 3-turn conversation. They also provide a distribution of labels across these sets, which is crucial information.

The dataset is categorized into four emotion labels: "Happy," "Sad," "Angry," and "Others," with specific counts for training, development, and test sets. This section confirms that the dataset is indeed used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The dataset used in this paper is part of the SemEval-2019 Task 3, and the relevant citation is:

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: SemEval-2019 Task 3 Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of 3-turn conversations labeled with emotions: "Happy," "Sad," "Angry," and "Others." It includes training, development, and test sets with specific counts for each label.
   - **Citation**: Ankush Chatterjee, Kedhar Nath Narahari, Meghana Joshi, and Puneet Agrawal. 2019. SemEval-2019 Task 3: Emocontext: Contextual emotion detection in text.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
