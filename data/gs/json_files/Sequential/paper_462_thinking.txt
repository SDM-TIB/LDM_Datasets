To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quasi Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Word Sense Disambiguation" by Michele Bevilacqua and Roberto Navigli, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have trained a WSD system that outperforms previous methods on various evaluation datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look closely at **section 5 (Evaluation tasks)**, where the authors describe their experiments. In **subsection 5.1 (Word Sense Disambiguation)**, they mention using the **SemCor** dataset for training and the **WordNet’s Tagged Glosses (WTG)** for additional training data. They also specify that they evaluate their model on several benchmark datasets, including **Senseval-2**, **Senseval-3**, **SemEval-07**, **SemEval-13**, and **SemEval-15**.

In **subsection 5.2 (Word-in-Context)**, the authors refer to the **Word-in-Context (WiC)** dataset, which is used to evaluate the performance of their model in a binary classification task.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their proper citations from the paper.
