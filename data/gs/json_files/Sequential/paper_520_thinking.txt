To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Role of Protected Class Word Lists in Bias Identification of Contextualized Word Representations" by JoÃ£o Sedoc and Lyle Ungar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of contextualized word embeddings and mentions the need for target word lists, which suggests that datasets related to these lists may be present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Target Word Lists)**, where the authors describe the specific word lists used for debiasing. They mention using a list of gendered or racially marked terms, which indicates that these lists are crucial datasets for their experiments. The authors specifically reference the pronouns used by Caliskan et al. (2017) and a more comprehensive list of gender-specific words, which are essential for understanding the context of their research.

In this section, I will note the following datasets:

1. **Gender Pronouns List**: This list includes pronouns specific to gender, such as "he/she" and "himself/herself." The authors reference Caliskan et al. (2017) for this dataset.

2. **Comprehensive Gender-Specific Words List**: This dataset includes gender-specific terms related to occupations and relationships, such as "brother/sister" and "host/hostess." The authors do not provide a specific citation for this list, but it is mentioned as a critical component of their methodology.

3. **Names List**: The authors also mention testing with male and female names, such as "Aaron/Alice" and "Chris/Clary." They provide links to various sources for these names, which can be considered datasets for their analysis.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets mentioned. The citation for the gender pronouns list is:

- For the **gender pronouns list**:
  > Caliskan, A., Bryson, J. J., & Narayanan, A. (2017). Semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases. *Science*, 356(6334), 183-186.

The comprehensive gender-specific words list does not have a specific citation provided in the paper, but it is essential to note that it is derived from the authors' own compilation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that full citations are included where applicable. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
