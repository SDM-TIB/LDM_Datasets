To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BERT-AL: BERT for Arbitrarily Long Document Understanding," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention demonstrating the effectiveness of their model on the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset** for text summarization. This indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In **section 4.1**, they explicitly describe the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**, stating that it contains news articles and associated highlights, with specific statistics on the training, validation, and test splits. This section provides valuable information about the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. The authors reference the original work that introduced this dataset, which is:

> Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 1693â€“1701, 2015.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and complete, ready for any further processing or review.
