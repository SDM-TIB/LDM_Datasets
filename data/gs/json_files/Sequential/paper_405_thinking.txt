To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLP at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Multi-Encoder in Hierarchical Attention Networks for Contextual Emotion Detection" by Changjie Li and Yun Xing, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the task and mentions the use of a deep learning architecture for emotion detection, but it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of emotion detection in text and reference the SemEval-2019 Task 3. This task involves classifying emotions in user utterances, but again, no specific datasets are named.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for any mention of datasets used for training, validation, or testing. In this section, the authors describe the data preparation process, indicating that the organizers provided **30,160 conversations for training**, **2,755 for development**, and **5,509 for testing**. However, they do not provide a specific name for the dataset, as it is derived from the SemEval-2019 Task 3.

I will also check the **tables** presented in the paper, particularly **Table 1**, which outlines the emotion distribution across different datasets (original, cleaned, and augmented). This table provides insight into the dataset's structure but does not offer a formal citation.

Since the dataset is associated with the SemEval-2019 Task 3, I will look for the official citation for this task in the **references section**. The relevant citation for the SemEval-2019 Task 3 is:

> Ankush Chatterjee, Kedhar Nath Narahari, Meghana Joshi, and Puneet Agrawal. *SemEval-2019 Task 3: Emocontext: Contextual Emotion Detection in Text*. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, June 6–7, 2019.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: SemEval-2019 Task 3 Dataset
   - **Description**: Contains 30,160 conversations for training, 2,755 for development, and 5,509 for testing, focusing on contextual emotion detection in text.
   - **Citation**: Ankush Chatterjee, Kedhar Nath Narahari, Meghana Joshi, and Puneet Agrawal. *SemEval-2019 Task 3: Emocontext: Contextual Emotion Detection in Text*. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, June 6–7, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry according to the required format for further processing.
