To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Semantic Role Labeling with Cross-View Training" by Rui Cai and Mirella Lapata, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **CoNLL-2009 benchmark dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely to be one of the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, such as a dedicated **Datasets** or **Experiments** section. In this paper, the **Experiments** section (section 3) provides insights into the datasets utilized. The authors explicitly mention using the **CoNLL-2009 benchmark dataset** for their experiments on semantic role labeling.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **CoNLL-2009 benchmark dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> H. Surdeanu, J. H. Martin, and C. D. Manning. *The CoNLL-2009 Shared Task: Syntactic and Semantic Dependencies in the CoNLL-2009 Shared Task*. In Proceedings of the 2009 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1–10, Singapore, 2009.

Additionally, the authors mention using several unlabeled datasets for training, including the **1 Billion Word Language Model Benchmark**, **Sougou News Data** for Chinese, **NEGRA corpus** for German, and the **Spanish Language News Corpus**. I will extract these datasets as well.

For each of these datasets, I will also look for their full citations in the references section:

1. **1 Billion Word Language Model Benchmark**:
   > C. Chelba, T. Mikolov, M. Schuster, Q. Ge, T. Brants, P. Koehn, and T. Robinson. *One billion word benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.3005, 2013.

2. **Sougou News Data**:
   > Sougou Labs. *Sogou News Data*. Available at: www.sogou.com/labs/resource/ca.php.

3. **NEGRA corpus**:
   > A. Björkelund, B. Bohnet, L. Hafdell, and P. Nugues. *A high-performance syntactic and semantic dependency parser*. In Coling 2010: Demonstrations, pages 33–36, Beijing, China.

4. **Spanish Language News Corpus**:
   > Available at: catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99T41.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
