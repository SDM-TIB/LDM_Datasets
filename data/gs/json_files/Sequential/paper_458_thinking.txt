To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Deep contextualized word representations for detecting sarcasm and irony" by Suzana Ilić et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their model on **7 different datasets derived from 3 different data sources**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of sarcasm and irony detection in NLP, hinting at the datasets used for this purpose.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe the datasets in detail. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **SemEval-2018 Dataset**: This dataset is used for irony detection in English tweets and is referenced from the work of Van Hee et al. (2018). It includes 3,834 total samples, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing.

2. **Riloff Dataset**: This dataset is manually annotated for sarcasm and is cited from Riloff et al. (2013). It contains 68,582 samples.

3. **Ptáček Dataset**: This dataset consists of user self-annotated tweets with the #sarcasm hashtag, referenced from Ptáček et al. (2014), totaling 1,897 samples.

4. **SARC 2.0 Dataset**: Collected by Khodak et al. (2017), this dataset comprises 321,748 sarcastic comments from Reddit.

5. **SARC 2.0 pol Dataset**: A political subset of the SARC dataset, also from Khodak et al. (2017), containing 17,074 samples.

6. **Sarcasm Corpus V1 (SC-V1)**: This dataset is part of the Internet Argument Corpus and is referenced from Oraby et al. (2016), with 1,995 samples.

7. **Sarcasm Corpus V2 (SC-V2)**: Another subset of the Internet Argument Corpus, also from Oraby et al. (2016), containing 4,692 samples.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to ensure I have the full citations for each dataset:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
