To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Relational Features and Learning under Distant Supervision for Information Extraction Tasks" by Ajay Nagesh, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the body of the paper for specific dataset information.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Learning for Relation Extraction)**, where the author discusses the use of distant supervision for relation extraction. Here, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation purposes. The author mentions the use of a "large unlabeled corpus" and aligns facts from a database to sentences in this corpus, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced.

In **section 3.1 (Constrained Distant Supervision)**, the author refers to the "at least one" heuristic and discusses alignment strategies, but I need to confirm if any specific datasets are named. If the author cites any datasets or provides references to previous works that utilized specific datasets, I will note those down.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the author refers to datasets from other studies, I will ensure to extract the complete citation for those datasets as well.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. If no specific datasets are mentioned, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
