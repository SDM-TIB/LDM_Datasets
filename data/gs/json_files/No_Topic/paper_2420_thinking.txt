To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Document Representations for Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval in Low-Resource Settings" by Mahsa Yarmohammadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors performed experiments on three challenging collections consisting of Somali, Swahili, and Tagalog speech/text documents. This suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) and mention the use of low-resource languages, which aligns with the datasets mentioned in the abstract.

In the **methods section**, particularly in **section 5 (Data)**, the authors provide detailed statistics about the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three low-resource test collections from the IARPA MATERIAL project, specifically:

1. **Somali Dataset**: This dataset includes speech and text documents, with a total of 838 documents and 442 queries.
2. **Swahili Dataset**: This dataset consists of 813 documents and 547 queries.
3. **Tagalog Dataset**: This dataset has 844 documents and 537 queries.

The authors also provide statistics on the number of text and speech documents for each language, confirming the datasets' relevance to their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. The paper mentions that the data is provided in the BUILD package of the MATERIAL project, which is publicly available. However, it does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves. Instead, I will note that the datasets are part of the IARPA MATERIAL project and provide the citation for the project as follows:

- **IARPA MATERIAL Project**: 
  > IARPA. *OpenCLIR Evaluation*. 2018. Available at: https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/openclir-evaluation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details and citations for each dataset. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
