To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Tagging-style Reordering Model for Phrase-based SMT" by Minwei Feng and Hermann Ney, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of reordering in statistical machine translation but do not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.

In **section 5 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention that they carried out experiments on five Chinese-English NIST tasks trained with BOLT data. This indicates that there are datasets involved, specifically the NIST tasks and BOLT data.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the text. The authors mention that they used the **NIST test corpora** (NIST02, NIST03, NIST04, NIST05, and NIST08) for evaluation. I will note these datasets and their significance in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The NIST datasets are commonly referenced in the field, and I can find their citations in the literature. The BOLT data is also a well-known dataset in machine translation research.

The citations I will include are:

- For the **NIST datasets**, the citation is:
  > National Institute of Standards and Technology. *NIST Open Machine Translation Evaluation*. Available at: https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/open-machine-translation-evaluation.

- For the **BOLT data**, the citation is:
  > BOLT Program. *BOLT: Broad Operational Language Translation*. Available at: https://www.darpa.mil/program/bolt.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
