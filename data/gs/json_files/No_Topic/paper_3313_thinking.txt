To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Replicating and Extending 'Because Their Treebanks Leak': Graph Isomorphism, Covariants, and Parser Performance" by Mark Anderson et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a replication study and mentions the use of treebanks, which suggests that datasets related to treebanks are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors refer to the original study by Søgaard (2020) that utilized specific treebanks for their analysis. I will look for explicit mentions of datasets or treebanks that were used in both the original and the replication study.

In the **analysis and results section**, the authors mention using **33 Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks** and refer to the parser performance metrics derived from these datasets. This indicates that the datasets are related to Universal Dependencies, which is a well-known collection of treebanks.

I will then check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations for the datasets used in the paper are:

1. **Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks**: 
   > Zeman, Daniel, et al. "Universal Dependencies 2.5." LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ digital library at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (UFAL), Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, 2019.

2. **CoNLL 2018 Shared Task datasets**: 
   > Zeman, Daniel, et al. "CoNLL 2018 shared task: Multilingual parsing from raw text to Universal Dependencies." In Proceedings of the CoNLL 2018 Shared Task: Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies, pages 1–21, Brussels, Belgium, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited according to the references provided in the paper. This will ensure that the extraction is thorough and adheres to academic standards for citation.
