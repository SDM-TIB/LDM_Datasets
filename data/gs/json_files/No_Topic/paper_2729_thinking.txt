To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Psycholinguistic Diagnosis of Language Models’ Commonsense Reasoning" by Yan Cong, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper uses psycholinguistic datasets to probe language models’ commonsense reasoning, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where the author describes the methodologies used. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets utilized in the experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

In **Study 1**, the author references the work of Singh et al. (2016) and states that they extracted 82 items from their human experiments. This indicates that the dataset used is derived from Singh et al. (2016), which I will need to cite fully.

In **Study 2**, the author mentions extracting 168 items from Nieuwland et al. (2010). This is another dataset that I need to document and cite.

Additionally, the paper discusses fine-tuning DistillBERT with the **ImpPress dataset** from Jeretic et al. (2020), which is also crucial to include.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each of these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the dataset derived from Singh et al. (2016):
   > Raj Singh, Evelina Fedorenko, Kyle Mahowald, and Edward Gibson. *Accommodating presuppositions is inappropriate in implausible contexts*. Cognitive Science, 40:607–634, 2016.

2. For the dataset from Nieuwland et al. (2010):
   > Mante S. Nieuwland, Tali Ditman, and Gina R. Kuperberg. *On the incrementality of pragmatic processing: An ERP investigation of informativeness and pragmatic abilities*. Journal of Memory and Language, 63:324–346, 2010.

3. For the ImpPress dataset from Jeretic et al. (2020):
   > Paloma Jeretic, Alex Warstadt, Suvrat Bhooshan, and Adina Williams. *Are natural language inference models IMPPRESsive? Learning IMPlicature and PRESupposition*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 8690–8705, Online, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured the relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
