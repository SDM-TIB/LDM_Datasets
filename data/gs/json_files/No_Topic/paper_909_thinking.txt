To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tools for Digital Humanities: Enabling Access to the Old Occitan Romance of Flamenca" by Olga Scrivner and Sandra Kübler, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions a **multi-dimensional parallel Old Occitan-English corpus**, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Parallel Occitan-English Corpus)**, where the authors describe the compilation of the corpus. They mention that the corpus consists of the **Romance of Flamenca**, an Old Occitan poem, along with its English translation. This section will provide details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

In this section, the authors also discuss the **word alignment** and the methodology used to create the parallel corpus. They highlight the challenges faced in aligning the Old Occitan text with its English translation, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and usability.

I will also look for any references to other datasets or resources used in the paper. For instance, the authors mention using the **NRC emotion lexicon** for emotion annotation, which is another dataset relevant to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Romance of Flamenca**: The citation is:
   > E.D. Blodgett. *The Romance of Flamenca*. Garland, New York, 1995.

2. **NRC Emotion Lexicon**: The citation is:
   > Saif Mohammad and Tony Yang. "Tracking sentiment in mail: How genders differ on emotional axes." In Proceedings of the ACL Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis (WASSA), pages 70–79, Portland, OR, 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
