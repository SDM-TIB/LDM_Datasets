To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Correlational Gaussian Processes for Cross-domain Visual Recognition" by Chengjiang Long and Gang Hua, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on "four challenging image collections," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using three image collections: **E-Album**, **G-Album**, and **VP dataset**. I will take note of these names as potential datasets.

In the **experiments subsection** (5.1), the authors provide details about the E-Album and G-Album, including the number of photos and the domains involved (people, location, and event). They also mention the features used for each domain, which helps to understand the context of the datasets.

In **subsection 5.2**, they discuss the VP dataset, providing details about the number of images and the domains (people, gesture, and scene). This section confirms that the VP dataset is indeed a dataset used in their experiments.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- For the **E-Album**:
  > J. Cui et al. *Easyalbum: an interactive photo annotation system based on face clustering and re-ranking*. In SIGCHI, 2007.

- For the **G-Album**:
  > J. Cui et al. *Easyalbum: an interactive photo annotation system based on face clustering and re-ranking*. In SIGCHI, 2007.

- For the **VP dataset**:
  > J. Joo et al. *Visual persuasion: Inferring communicative intents of images*. In CVPR, 2014.

- For the **SUN 09 dataset**:
  > M. J. Choi et al. *Exploiting hierarchical context on a large database of object categories*. In CVPR, 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
