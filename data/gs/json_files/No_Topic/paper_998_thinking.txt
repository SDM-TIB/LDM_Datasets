To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing the topology of diachronic word embeddings" by Yuri Bizzoni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data/methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper focuses on the Royal Society Corpus (RSC), which is a diachronic corpus of scientific writing. This suggests that the RSC is a primary dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Data and Methods)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they explicitly mention using **v4.0 of the Royal Society Corpus (RSC)**, which contains publications from the Philosophical Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of London from 1665 to 1869, comprising approximately 32 million tokens and 10,000 documents. This section confirms that the RSC is the main dataset utilized for their analysis.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Royal Society Corpus. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Hannah Kermes, Stefania Degaetano-Ortlieb, Ashraf Khamis, Jörg Knappen, and Elke Teich. *The Royal Society Corpus: From Uncharted Data to Corpus*. In Proceedings of the 10th LREC, Portorož, Slovenia. ELRA, 2016.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the RSC, I will note that this is the only dataset mentioned. 

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. 

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in this research paper, ready for further processing or review.
