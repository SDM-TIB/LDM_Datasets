To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Assessment of the Accuracy of Automatic Evaluation in Summarization" by Karolina Owczarzak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions an assessment of automatic evaluations used for multi-document summarization of news, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors discuss the evaluation metrics and the datasets used for their analyses. They specifically mention using data from the **Text Analysis Conference (TAC) 2008-2011**. This indicates that the TAC datasets are central to their research.

In **section 4.1 (Which is the best ROUGE variant)**, the authors provide a detailed overview of the datasets used, specifically mentioning the **TAC 2008-2011 datasets**. They describe the number of topics and participants for each year, which is crucial information for dataset documentation.

The paper outlines the following details about the datasets:

1. **TAC 2008 Dataset**: Contains 48 topics, with 58 automatic summarizers and 8 human summarizers, each providing 4 reference summaries.
2. **TAC 2009 Dataset**: Contains 44 topics, with 55 automatic summarizers and 8 human summarizers, each providing 4 reference summaries.
3. **TAC 2010 Dataset**: Contains 46 topics, with 43 automatic summarizers and 8 human summarizers, each providing 4 reference summaries.
4. **TAC 2011 Dataset**: Contains 44 topics, with 50 automatic summarizers and 8 human summarizers, each providing 4 reference summaries.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The authors reference the TAC datasets and the relevant papers associated with them. The citation for the TAC datasets is:

- For **TAC 2008-2011**, the citation is:
  > Paul Over, Hoa Dang, and Donna Harman. *DUC in context*. Information Processing & Management, 43(6), 1506â€“1520, 2007.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
