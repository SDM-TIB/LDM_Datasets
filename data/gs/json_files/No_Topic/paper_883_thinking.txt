To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Argument-Level Interactions for Persuasion Comments Evaluation using Co-attention Model" by Lu Ji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a "publicly available dataset," which suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the context of their research. They mention that their datasets are collected from an online forum, specifically referencing the **/r/ChangeMyView subreddit (CMV)**. This is a strong indication that this subreddit is the primary source of their dataset.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more details about the dataset. They state that the dataset consists of 3,456 training instances and 807 testing instances, with each instance including an original post along with a positive and a negative reply. This further confirms the dataset's structure and its relevance to their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as being used in previous work by Tan et al. (2016). Therefore, I will look up the citation for that paper to provide the authoritative reference for the dataset.

The citation for the dataset used in this paper is:
> Tan, C., Niculae, V., Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, C., & Lee, L. (2016). Winning arguments: Interaction dynamics and persuasion strategies in good-faith online discussions. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pages 613–624.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: ChangeMyView Dataset
   - **Description**: Collected from the /r/ChangeMyView subreddit, this dataset consists of 3,456 training instances and 807 testing instances, where each instance includes an original post with one positive and one negative reply.
   - **Citation**: Tan, C., Niculae, V., Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, C., & Lee, L. (2016). Winning arguments: Interaction dynamics and persuasion strategies in good-faith online discussions. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pages 613–624.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into the required format for further processing or review.
