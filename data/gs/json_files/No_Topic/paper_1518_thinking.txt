To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CANE: Context-Aware Network Embedding for Relation Modeling" by Cunchao Tu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **three real-world datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **Cora**: A citation network of machine learning papers, consisting of 2,277 vertices and 5,214 edges, categorized into 7 labels. The authors reference the original construction of this dataset by McCallum et al. (2000).

2. **HepTh**: A citation network from arXiv, specifically for High Energy Physics Theory papers. It contains 1,038 vertices and 1,990 edges. The authors cite Leskovec et al. (2005) for this dataset.

3. **Zhihu**: A dataset derived from the Zhihu Q&A platform, consisting of 10,000 active users and 43,894 edges. The authors mention that they crawled this data randomly from the platform.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Andrew McCallum, Kamal Nigam, Jason Rennie, and Kristie Seymore. *Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning*. Information Retrieval Journal, 3:127–163, 2000.

- For **HepTh**, the citation is:
  > Jure Leskovec, Jon Kleinberg, and Christos Faloutsos. *Graphs over time: densiﬁcation laws, shrinking diameters and possible explanations*. In Proceedings of KDD, pages 177–187, 2005.

- For **Zhihu**, the authors do not provide a formal citation in the references, but they mention that the data was crawled from the Zhihu platform.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further analysis.
