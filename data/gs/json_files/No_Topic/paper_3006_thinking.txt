To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalizing A Person Retrieval Model Hetero- and Homogeneously" by Zhun Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors report new state-of-the-art UDA accuracy on three datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **Market-1501**: This dataset contains 32,668 labeled images of 1,501 identities collected from 6 cameras. It is used for training and evaluation, with specific splits for training and testing.

2. **DukeMTMC-reID**: This dataset has 36,411 labeled images belonging to 1,404 identities captured by 8 cameras. Similar to Market-1501, it has designated training and testing splits.

3. **CUHK03**: This dataset consists of 14,096 images of 1,467 identities, with each identity captured from two cameras. The authors specify that they use the detected bounding boxes for a more challenging evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilize these datasets for their experiments, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Market-1501**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, L., Shen, L., Tian, L., Wang, S., Wang, J., & Tian, Q. (2015). *Scalable person re-identification: A benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2156–2163.

- For **DukeMTMC-reID**, the citation is:
  > Ristani, E., Solera, F., Zou, R., Cucchiara, R., & Tomasi, C. (2016). *Performance measures and a data set for multi-target, multi-camera tracking*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ECCVW), pages 1–14.

- For **CUHK03**, the citation is:
  > Li, W., Zhao, R., Xiao, T., & Wang, X. (2014). *DeepReid: Deep filter pairing neural network for person re-identification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 152–159.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
