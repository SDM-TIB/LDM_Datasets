To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Learning with a Controlled Degree of Task-Adaptive Conditioning," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive simulations based on the **miniImageNet** and **tieredImageNet** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4, the authors clearly state that they evaluated their method using **miniImageNet** and **tieredImageNet**. They describe how they split the datasets into labeled and unlabeled sets for their semi-supervised learning experiments, which provides additional context about how these datasets were utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources of the datasets.

1. For **miniImageNet**, the citation is:
   > Oriol Vinyals, Charles Blundell, Timothy Lillicrap, Koray Kavukcuoglu, and Daan Wierstra. *Matching Networks for One Shot Learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), pp. 3630â€“3638, 2016.

2. For **tieredImageNet**, the citation is:
   > Mengye Ren, Sachin Ravi, Eleni Triantafillou, Jake Snell, Kevin Swersky, Josh B. Tenenbaum, Hugo Larochelle, and Richard S. Zemel. *Meta-learning for Semi-supervised Few-shot Classification*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2018.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **miniImageNet**: A dataset used for few-shot learning, consisting of 60,000 images across 100 classes. It is commonly used for evaluating few-shot learning algorithms.

- **tieredImageNet**: A larger dataset derived from ImageNet, designed for few-shot learning, containing 608 classes split into 34 categories, with a total of 779,165 images.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for structured output or further processing.
