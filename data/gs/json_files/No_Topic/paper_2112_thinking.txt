To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3PointTM: Faster Measurement of High-Dimensional Transmission Matrices" by Yujun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the measurement of transmission matrices (TMs) and mentions validation on real and simulated data, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experimental Results)** or any dedicated **Datasets** section. In these sections, the authors may describe the datasets used for validation or experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I will note any datasets explicitly mentioned, including their characteristics, such as size, type, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial as I need to provide complete citations for each dataset. I will look for any papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for their experiments, I will ensure to find the original source of that dataset and document it properly.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
