To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Exact Penalty Method for Locally Convergent Maximum Consensus" by Huu Le, Tat-Jun Chin, and David Suter, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in previous work or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention testing their method on various parameter estimation problems, which suggests that specific datasets are involved.

I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **results section**. The authors provide quantitative results for different methods, and they mention datasets like the **VGG dataset** for fundamental matrix estimation and **NotreDame dataset** for triangulation. These are key indicators that I need to note.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations will provide the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

1. **VGG dataset**: The citation is:
   > Andrew Vedaldi and Brian Fulkerson. *VLFeat: An open and portable library of computer vision algorithms*. In Proceedings of the 18th ACM international conference on Multimedia, pages 1469–1472, 2010.

2. **NotreDame dataset**: The citation is:
   > Noah Snavely, Steven M. Seitz, and Richard Szeliski. *Photo tourism: exploring photo collections in 3D*. In ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), volume 25, pages 835–846, 2006.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will ensure that the extracted datasets are well-documented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
