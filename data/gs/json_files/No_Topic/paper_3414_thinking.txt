To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ARShadowGAN: Shadow Generative Adversarial Network for Augmented Reality in Single Light Scenes" by Daquan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a dataset for training and evaluating their proposed ARShadowGAN, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Shadow-AR Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they constructed. They describe the dataset as containing 3,000 quintuples, each consisting of a synthetic image without the virtual object shadow, its corresponding image with the virtual object shadow, a mask of the virtual object, a labeled real-world shadow matting, and its corresponding labeled occluder. This section is crucial as it outlines the dataset's structure and purpose.

The authors also mention that the dataset includes images taken with a Logitech C920 camera and that they used models from public datasets like ShapeNet. This indicates that the Shadow-AR dataset is built upon existing resources, which is important for citation purposes.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used the Shadow-AR dataset for their evaluations, reinforcing its significance in their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the following datasets:

1. **Shadow-AR Dataset**: This is the primary dataset constructed by the authors. Since it is newly created, it does not have a citation in the traditional sense, but I will note its details as described in the paper.

2. **ShapeNet**: The authors mention using models from this dataset. The citation for ShapeNet is:
   > Angel X Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

3. **SBU Dataset**: The authors reference this dataset as a comparison point. The citation is:
   > Jifeng Wang, Xiang Li, and Jian Yang. *Stacked conditional generative adversarial networks for jointly learning shadow detection and shadow removal*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1788–1797, 2018.

4. **ISTD Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned in the context of existing shadow datasets. The citation is:
   > Liangqiong Qu, Jiandong Tian, Shengfeng He, Yandong Tang, and Rynson WH Lau. *Deshadownet: A multi-context embedding deep network for shadow removal*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4067–4075, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the referenced datasets and a description of the Shadow-AR dataset as constructed by the authors. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
