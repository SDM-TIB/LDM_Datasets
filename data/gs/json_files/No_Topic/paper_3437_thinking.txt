To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Figurative Language in Swedish Clinical Texts" by Dimitrios Kokkinakis, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if the author mentions any datasets or data sources used in the study. The abstract discusses the challenges of processing clinical texts and mentions the use of empirical clinical data, but does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experimental setting** section, as this is where the author is likely to describe the data collection process and any datasets used. In this section, the author mentions that the study is based on interactions between patients and healthcare providers, specifically focusing on 16 patients who contacted their primary healthcare center. The data consists of 75,000 tokens, but the author does not provide a formal dataset name or reference.

I will also look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **results** section. Here, the author discusses the identification of figurative expressions in the clinical data but does not refer to any established datasets. Instead, the focus is on the analysis of the data collected from patient interactions and electronic health records.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets or provide formal citations for them, I will note that the data used in this study is derived from a specific set of patient interactions rather than a named dataset. 

Finally, I will check the **references section** to see if there are any citations that might refer to datasets or resources used for idiomatic expressions or figurative language analysis. However, the references primarily cite previous research and theoretical frameworks rather than specific datasets.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses the data collected from patient interactions, it does not provide formal names or citations for any datasets. Therefore, I will document this finding, noting that the data is based on a specific study involving 16 patients and their interactions with healthcare providers, but no formal dataset citations are available.

I will summarize my findings as follows:
- No formal datasets were identified in the paper.
- The data used is based on patient interactions and electronic health records from a specific study involving 16 patients.
- No citations for datasets were provided in the references.

This will help in understanding the context of the research and the limitations regarding dataset availability in this study.
