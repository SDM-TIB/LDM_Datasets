To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MaCoCu: Massive collection and curation of monolingual and bilingual data: focus on under-resourced languages" by Marta Bañón et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the project's goals and the types of datasets being discussed. The abstract indicates that the project aims to build monolingual and parallel corpora for under-resourced European languages, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Outcomes of the project)**, particularly **subsection 2.1 (Corpora)**, where the authors describe the corpora being produced. They mention that the project targets ten languages, including Maltese, Bulgarian, Slovenian, Croatian, and Icelandic, and that they will produce both monolingual and parallel corpora. The details provided in this section will help me identify the specific datasets.

The authors provide a table (Table 1) that outlines the sizes of the monolingual and parallel corpora for each of the targeted languages. This table includes information about the number of documents and words for both types of corpora, which is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope.

Now, I will look for any references to existing datasets or initiatives that are related to the corpora being developed. The authors mention existing initiatives like **Paracrawl** and **Oscar**, which may have their own datasets that could be relevant to cite.

I will then check the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations for the existing initiatives are particularly important, as they provide context and credibility to the datasets being discussed.

The relevant citations I will extract are:

1. For **Paracrawl**:
   > Bañón, Marta, Pinzhen Chen, Barry Haddow, Kenneth Heafield, Hieu Hoang, Miquel Esplà-Gomis, Mikel L. Forcada, Amir Kamran, Faheem Kirefu, Philipp Koehn, Sergio Ortiz Rojas, Leopoldo Pla Sempere, Gema Ramírez-Sánchez, Elsa Sarrías, Marek Strelec, Brian Thompson, William Waites, Dion Wiggins, and Jaume Zaragoza. 2020. *ParaCrawl: Web-scale acquisition of parallel corpora*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 4555–4567, Online, July.

2. For **Oscar**:
   > Abadji, Julien, Pedro Ortiz Suarez, Laurent Romary, and Benoît Sagot. 2022. *Towards a Cleaner Document-Oriented Multilingual Crawled Corpus*. arXiv e-prints, page arXiv:2201.06642, January.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described, and include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets associated with the MaCoCu project, ready for further processing or review.
