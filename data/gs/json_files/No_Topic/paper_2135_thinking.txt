To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PTB Graph Parsing with Tree Approximation" by Yoshihide Kato and Shigeki Matsubara, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **Penn Treebank (PTB)**, which indicates that this is a dataset relevant to the research. The introduction further elaborates on the PTB, confirming its significance in the context of the study.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors discuss their experimental setup and refer to the PTB as the dataset used for training and evaluation. This is a crucial step, as it confirms the dataset's application in their research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Penn Treebank dataset. The citation for the PTB is as follows:
> Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: the Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 310-330.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the PTB dataset and does not mention any additional datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Penn Treebank dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. 

After completing this process, I will have a clear and structured entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for any further processing or review.
