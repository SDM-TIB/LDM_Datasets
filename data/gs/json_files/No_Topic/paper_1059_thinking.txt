To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Clause Attention based on Signal Words Division," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of long sentence translation and mention that they compile human translation techniques into natural language processing. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In **section 4 (Experiment)**, the authors mention evaluating their method on specific datasets. They state that they evaluate the Clause Attention (CA) model mainly on **CoNLL-2003 for Named Entity Recognition (NER) task** and **NiuTrans English-Chinese for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) task**. Additionally, they provide results on **WMT16 English-German** and **WMT15 English-Vietnamese** tasks.

Now, I will gather detailed information about each dataset:

1. **CoNLL-2003**: This dataset is widely used for named entity recognition tasks. It includes annotations for four entity types: LOC (locations), ORG (organizations), PER (persons), and MISC (miscellaneous). The authors mention that it supports 5,598 tags, including 2,752 LOC, 1,257 ORG, 1,349 PER, and 694 MISC.

2. **NiuTrans English-Chinese**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks. The authors provide a breakdown of the sentence pairs used for training, validation, and testing, which includes 80,000 training pairs, 10,000 validation pairs, and 10,000 test pairs.

3. **WMT16 English-German**: This dataset is part of the WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation) series and is used for evaluating machine translation systems. The authors do not provide specific details about the number of sentence pairs in this paper.

4. **WMT15 English-Vietnamese**: Similar to WMT16, this dataset is also part of the WMT series for machine translation evaluation. Again, specific details about the dataset are not provided in the paper.

Next, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
