To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Propbank Generation for Turkish" by Koray Ak and Olcay Taner Yıldız, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of an automatic Turkish PropBank using parallel data from English PropBank, indicating that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (PropBank)**, where the authors discuss the English PropBank and its relevance. They mention that the English PropBank is a commonly used semantic resource that includes predicate-argument structures. This section provides context but does not explicitly name datasets.

In **section 4 (Methods)**, the authors describe their approach to generating the Turkish PropBank. They specifically mention using the **Original English PropBank corpus** (Palmer et al., 2004) as a resource for their work. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

Additionally, in **section 4.2**, the authors refer to a dataset constructed by Ak et al. (2018), which is another important dataset for the Turkish PropBank. They state that this dataset contains 9,560 of 17,000 translated sentences annotated with semantic roles.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Original English PropBank**, the citation is:
   > Palmer, M., Kingsbury, P., Babko-Malaya, O., Cotton, S., & Snyder, B. (2004). *Proposition bank i*. Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium. LDC2004T14.

2. For the **Turkish Proposition Bank** constructed by Ak et al. (2018), the citation is:
   > Ak, K., Yıldız, O. T., Esgel, V., & Toprak, C. (2018). Construction of a Turkish proposition bank. *Turkish Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science*, 26, 570–581.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
