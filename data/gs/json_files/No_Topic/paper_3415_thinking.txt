To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiway Attention Networks for Modeling Sentence Pairs" by Chuanqi Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several tasks using four standard benchmark datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed present, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **Quora Question Pairs**: This dataset consists of over 400,000 question pairs, annotated with binary values indicating whether the questions are paraphrases. The authors specify that they selected 5,000 paraphrases and 5,000 non-paraphrases for the development and test sets.

2. **SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset contains 570,152 sentence pairs labeled with relationships such as entailment, contradiction, and neutral. The authors note that they used 549,367 pairs for training and provide details about the development and test sets.

3. **MultiNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset includes 392,702 pairs for training, with separate matched and mismatched pairs for development and testing. The authors reference the original paper for this dataset.

4. **SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)**: This reading comprehension dataset requires answers to be spans of text from corresponding passages. The authors describe how they split the development set for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Quora Question Pairs**, the citation is:
  > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel R. Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.05426, 2017.

- For **SNLI**, the citation is:
  > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In EMNLP, 2015.

- For **MultiNLI**, the citation is:
  > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel R. Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.05426, 2017.

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In EMNLP, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
