To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AIR-JPMC@SMM4H’22: BERT + Ensembling = Too Cool: Using Multiple BERT Models Together for Various COVID-19 Tweet Identification Tasks" by Leung Wai Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the tasks, but the **datasets section** is where I will find specific details about the datasets used.

In **section 2 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **DeepADEMiner Dataset (Version 2)**: This dataset is referenced for Task 1, which involves classifying tweets related to Adverse Drug Events (ADEs). The authors cite Magge et al. (2021b) as the source of this dataset.

2. **Stance Detection Dataset**: This dataset is used for Task 2, which involves stance detection related to health mandates. The authors cite Davydova and Tutubalina (2022) as the source for this dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **DeepADEMiner Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Arjun Magge, Elena Tutubalina, Zulfat Miftahutdinov, Ilseyar Alimova, Anne Dirkson, Suzan Verberne, Davy Weissenbacher, and Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez. *DeepADEMiner: a deep learning pharmacovigilance pipeline for extraction and normalization of adverse drug event mentions on Twitter*. In Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, pages 2184–2192. American Medical Informatics Association, 2021.

- For the **Stance Detection Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Vera Davydova and Elena Tutubalina. *SMM4H 2022 Task 2: Dataset for stance and premise detection in tweets about health mandates related to COVID-19*. In Proceedings of the Seventh Social Media Mining for Health (#SMM4H) Workshop and Shared Task, pages –. 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its respective citation, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work.
