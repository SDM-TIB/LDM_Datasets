To extract datasets from the research paper titled "T3-Vis: a visual analytic framework for Training and fine-Tuning Transformers in NLP" by Raymond Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the framework's application in assisting researchers, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses various Transformer models and their training but does not explicitly mention datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **case studies** section, as this is where the authors are likely to provide practical examples of their framework's application. In the case studies, the authors refer to two datasets:

1. **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**: This dataset is used for the extractive summarization task. The authors mention that it is a popular benchmark for summarization tasks.

2. **Yahoo Answers dataset**: This dataset is utilized for topic classification, containing 10 topic classes.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, volume 28, pages 1693–1701. Curran Associates, Inc., 2015.

- For the **Yahoo Answers dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, volume 28, pages 649–657, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**: A widely used dataset for extractive summarization tasks, providing a benchmark for evaluating summarization models.
2. **Yahoo Answers dataset**: A dataset containing 10 topic classes, used for training and evaluating topic classification models.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
