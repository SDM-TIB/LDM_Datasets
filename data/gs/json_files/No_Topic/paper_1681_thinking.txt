To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Micro blogs Oriented Word Segmentation System" by Yijia Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors used a combination of annotated micro blogs and the People Daily corpus as training data. This indicates that these two datasets are significant for the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In this case, the **experiments section** (section 3) provides insights into the data preparation. The authors state that they crawled 1 million micro blog entries and manually annotated 1,442 entries for segmentation. This gives me the first dataset:

1. **Annotated Micro Blog Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,442 manually annotated micro blog entries used for training the segmentation model.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **People Daily corpus** as part of their labeled data. This corpus is referenced in the experiments section as well, confirming its use in the study.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

- For the **Annotated Micro Blog Dataset**, since it is a dataset created by the authors, I will note it as:
  > Liu, Y., Zhang, M., Che, W., Liu, T., & Deng, Y. (2012). *Micro blogs Oriented Word Segmentation System*. In Proceedings of the Second CIPS-SIGHAN Joint Conference on Chinese Language Processing, pages 85–89, Tianjin, China, 20-21 DEC. 2012.

- For the **People Daily corpus**, the citation is:
  > Che, W., Li, Z., & Liu, T. (2010). Ltp: A Chinese language technology platform. In Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Demonstrations, pages 13–16. Association for Computational Linguistics.

With these datasets identified and their citations noted, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations as required.
