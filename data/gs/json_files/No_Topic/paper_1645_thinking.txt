To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images based on modified DarkCovidNet model" by Dawit Kiros Redie et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves using chest X-ray images for diagnosing COVID-19, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention that they have obtained over 10,000 X-ray images from various sources, which is a significant clue about the datasets.

The authors specify three main sources for their dataset:

1. **COVID-19 X-ray Image Database by Cohen JP**: This database contains 468 X-ray images diagnosed with COVID-19.
2. **COVID-19 Radiography Database**: This source provides 1200 COVID-19 positive X-ray images, 1341 normal X-ray images, and 1345 pneumonia X-ray images.
3. **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)**: This dataset includes 1583 X-ray images of pneumonia cases.

I will now look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **COVID-19 Image Data Collection by Cohen JP**, the citation is:
  > Cohen JP. *COVID-19 Image Data Collection*. GitHub repository. https://github.com/ieee8023/COVID-chestxray-dataset.

- For the **COVID-19 Radiography Database**, the citation is:
  > Chowdhury MEH, Rahman T, Khandakar A, et al. *Can AI help in screening Viral and COVID-19 pneumonia?* arXiv preprint, 29 March 2020. https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database.

- For the **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)**, the citation is:
  > Wang X, Peng Y, Lu L, et al. *ChestX-ray8: Hospital scale chest x-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases*. In: Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp 2097â€“2106, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
