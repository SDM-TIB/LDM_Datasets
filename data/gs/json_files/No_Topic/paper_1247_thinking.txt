To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CTAP for Italian: Integrating Components for the Analysis of Italian into a Multilingual Linguistic Complexity Analysis Tool" by Nadezda Okinina et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the CTAP tool and its capabilities, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Linguistic Complexity Measurement Tools for Italian)**, where the authors discuss existing tools for measuring linguistic complexity in Italian. They mention three tools: **READ-IT**, **Coease**, and **Tint 2.0**. However, I need to find specific datasets associated with these tools.

In **section 4 (CTAP and Its Extension to Italian)**, the authors describe the features of CTAP and its architecture. They mention that CTAP integrates various linguistic complexity measures but do not specify datasets used for training or evaluation.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations that might refer to datasets. The references include various studies and tools, but I need to identify which ones are datasets.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors refer to several important resources:

1. **SUBTLEX-IT**: A dataset providing subtitle-based word frequency estimates for Italian.
   - Citation: Crepaldi, D., Amenta, S., Mandera, P., Keuleers, E., Brysbaert, M. (2015). *SUBTLEX-IT. Subtitle-based Word Frequency Estimates for Italian*. Annual Meeting of the Italian Association for Experimental Psychology, Rovereto, 10-12 September 2015.

2. **De Mauro Dictionary**: A reference for basic Italian vocabulary.
   - Citation: De Mauro, T., a cura di (2016). *Il Nuovo vocabolario di base della lingua italiana*. 23 dicembre 2016. https://dizionario.internazionale.it/nuovovocabolariodibase

3. **Google Books 2012**: A dataset used for various lexical features.
   - Citation: Lin, Y., Michel, J.-B., Aiden, E. L., Orwant, J., Brockman, W., Petrov, S. (2012). *Syntactic Annotations for the Google Books Ngram Corpus*. Proceedings of the 50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Jeju, Republic of Korea, 8-14 July 2012, pp. 169â€“174.

After identifying these datasets, I will compile the information, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for future reference.
