To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Atypical Inputs in Educational Applications" by Su-Youn Yoon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses automated scoring systems and mentions the evaluation of filtering models, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention a case study involving a low-stakes English proficiency practice test, which indicates that there is a dataset associated with this study.

In the **case study section**, the authors specify that they collected **6,000 responses from 1,000 test takers**, and these responses were scored by expert human raters. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in their research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this paper, the authors do not provide a separate dataset citation; instead, they describe the dataset they created for their study. Therefore, I will document the dataset based on the information provided in the text.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Low-Stakes English Proficiency Practice Test Responses
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of 6,000 responses collected from 1,000 test takers, where each response was scored on a scale of 1 to 4 by expert human raters. The dataset includes annotations for non-scorable responses, which were identified during the evaluation process.
   - **Citation**: Since this dataset is created by the authors for their study, it does not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. However, I will reference the paper itself as the source of this dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review. The key points to remember are the dataset name, description, and the citation of the paper as the source of the dataset.
