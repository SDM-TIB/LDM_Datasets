To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Preliminary Experiments on Crowdsourced Evaluation of Feedback Granularity" by Nitin Madnani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a crowdsourced study on Amazon Mechanical Turk, which suggests that there may be datasets related to the writing feedback provided to participants.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the design of their crowdsourcing experiment. Here, they mention using the **CLC-FCE corpus** (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011), which has been manually annotated for preposition errors. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in their study.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the **results and analysis sections**. However, the primary dataset appears to be the CLC-FCE corpus, as it is central to their experimental design.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the CLC-FCE corpus from the **References section**:

- For the **CLC-FCE corpus**, the citation is:
  > Helen Yannakoudakis, Ted Briscoe, and Ben Medlock. *A New Dataset and Method for Automatically Grading ESOL Texts*. In Proceedings of the ACL: HLT, pages 180â€“189, Portland, OR, USA, 2011.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information regarding the CLC-FCE corpus into a structured format that highlights its significance in the study.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and includes the full citation, ready for any further processing or review.
