To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mental Health Surveillance over Social Media with Digital Cohorts" by Silvio Amir, Mark Dredze, and John W. Ayers, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a cohort of US-based Twitter users to measure the prevalence of depression and PTSD, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled **"Mental Health Classifiers."** Here, the authors mention using self-reported datasets created for CLPsych 2015, which are crucial for understanding the mental health conditions they are analyzing. They specify that these datasets derive from users who have publicly disclosed a diagnosis of depression (327 users) or PTSD (246 users), along with an equal number of demographically matched controls.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:

1. For the **CLPsych 2015 shared task datasets**:
   > Glen Coppersmith, Margaret Mitchell, and Kristy Hollingshead, editors. *Proceedings of the Workshop on Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology: From Linguistic Signal to Clinical Reality*. North American Association for Computational Linguistics, Denver, Colorado, USA, 2015.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention using a demographic inference pipeline to annotate Twitter users with key demographic attributes, but this does not constitute a separate dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. The key dataset extracted from the paper is the CLPsych 2015 shared task datasets, which are essential for their analysis of mental health conditions.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
