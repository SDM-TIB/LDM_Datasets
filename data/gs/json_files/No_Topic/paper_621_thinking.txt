To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Noisy Correspondence Learning with Equivariant Similarity Consistency" by Yuchen Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three widely used datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the relevant information is found in **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail.

The paper lists three datasets:
1. **Flickr30K**: This dataset contains 31,014 images, each with five captions. The authors specify that they used 1,014 images for validation, 1,000 for testing, and 29,000 for training.
2. **MS-COCO**: This dataset includes 123,287 images, with each image associated with five captions. The authors used 5,000 images for validation, 5,000 for testing, and 113,287 for training.
3. **Conceptual Captions**: This dataset consists of approximately 3,334,173 images, each with a single caption. The authors used a smaller version called CC152K, which includes 150,000 images for training, 1,000 for validation, and 1,000 for testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Flickr30K**, the citation is:
  > Peter Young, Alice Lai, Micah Hodosh, and Julia Hockenmaier. *From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2:67–78, 2014.

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > T. Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollar, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. 2014.

- For **Conceptual Captions**, the citation is:
  > Piyush Sharma, Nan Ding, Sebastian Goodman, and Radu Soricut. *Conceptual captions: A cleaned, hypernymed, image alt-text dataset for automatic image captioning*. In ACL, pages 2556–2565, 2018.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing.
