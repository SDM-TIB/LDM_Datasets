To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Interpretable Model with Transformation Equivariant Interpretation" by Yipei Wang and Xiaoqian Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics, the number of samples, and any relevant splits or transformations applied during the experiments.

In the experiments on MNIST, the authors state that they implemented their model on the MNIST dataset, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification. They mention that the dataset consists of images of digits and that their model does not sacrifice prediction power for interpretability.

For the CIFAR-10 dataset, the authors describe how their model was applied to this dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. They highlight that their model successfully highlights the main parts of objects in the images and preserves good transformation equivariance.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
