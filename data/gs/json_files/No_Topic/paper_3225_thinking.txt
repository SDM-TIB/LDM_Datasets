To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CHRF deconstructed: β parameters and n-gram weights" by Maja Popović, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves comparing CHRF scores with WORDF scores across various translation outputs from the WMT14 and WMT15 shared tasks. This suggests that datasets from these tasks are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the author discusses the experiments conducted. The paper mentions that CHRF and WORDF scores were calculated for all available translation outputs from the **WMT14** and **WMT15** shared tasks. This is a clear indication that these two datasets are central to the research.

In the **experiments section**, the author describes the datasets used for evaluation. Specifically, the paper refers to translation outputs from the WMT14 and WMT15 shared tasks, which include various target languages such as English, French, German, Czech, Russian, Hindi, and Finnish. However, the paper does not provide detailed descriptions of these datasets, so I will need to refer to the references section for full citations.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **WMT14 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ondrej Bojar, Christian Buck, Christian Federmann, Barry Haddow, Philipp Koehn, Johannes Leveling, Christof Monz, Pavel Pecina, Matt Post, Herve Saint-Amand, Radu Soricut, Lucia Specia, and Aleš Tamchyna. *Findings of the 2014 workshop on statistical machine translation*. In Proceedings of the 9th Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT-14), pages 12–58, Baltimore, Maryland, USA, June 2014.

2. For the **WMT15 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ondřej Bojar, Rajen Chatterjee, Christian Federmann, Barry Haddow, Matthias Huck, Chris Hokamp, Philipp Koehn, Varvara Logacheva, Christof Monz, Matteo Negri, Matt Post, Carolina Scarton, Lucia Specia, and Marco Turchi. *Findings of the 2015 workshop on statistical machine translation*. In Proceedings of the 10th Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT-15), pages 1–46, Lisbon, Portugal, September 2015.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **WMT14 Dataset**: Contains translation outputs from the 2014 statistical machine translation shared task, evaluated across multiple languages.
- **WMT15 Dataset**: Contains translation outputs from the 2015 statistical machine translation shared task, also evaluated across multiple languages.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and completeness.
