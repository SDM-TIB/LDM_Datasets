To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Theory of Self-Supervised Framework for Few-Shot Learning," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of self-supervised learning (SSL) to few-shot learning (FSL) but does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction mentions that the experiments were conducted on two FSL benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the datasets are described in the **Experiments** section, where the authors state that they evaluate their method on two benchmark datasets: **Omniglot** and **miniImageNet**.

1. **Omniglot Dataset**: The paper describes Omniglot as a character image dataset containing 1623 handwritten characters from 50 alphabets. Each character has 20 gray images drawn by different writers, and the dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **miniImageNet Dataset**: This dataset is described as a downsampled image subset of the large-scale ImageNet dataset. It consists of 100 classes with 600 RGB images of size 84 Ã— 84 per class, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Omniglot Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lake, B. M., Salakhutdinov, R., & Tenenbaum, J. B. (2015). Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction. *Science*, 350(6266), 1332-1338.

- For the **miniImageNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., Wierstra, D., et al. (2016). Matching networks for one shot learning. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* (NIPS), 29.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that all relevant details are documented accurately. This structured approach will help in extracting and presenting the datasets effectively.
