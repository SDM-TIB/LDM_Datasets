To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Number agreement, dependency length, and word order in Finnish traditional dialects" by Kaius Sinnemäki and Akira Takaki, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used data from **The Finnish Dialect Syntax Archive**, which is a strong lead for a dataset.

Next, in the **introduction**, the authors discuss the variation in number agreement in Finnish traditional dialects and mention the use of corpus data. This reinforces the idea that the Finnish Dialect Syntax Archive is the primary dataset of interest.

In **section 2 (Data and methods)**, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They specify that the data comes from **The Finnish Dialect Syntax Archive**, which contains recorded spoken data from over 100 interviewees, totaling roughly one million lemmas. This section also describes the criteria for data extraction, confirming that this dataset is indeed the one used for their analysis.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The citation for **The Finnish Dialect Syntax Archive** is as follows:
> University of Turku, School of Languages and Translation Studies and Institute for the Languages of Finland. 1985. *The Finnish Dialect Syntax Archive’s Helsinki Korp Version*.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the full citation, as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work or analysis.
