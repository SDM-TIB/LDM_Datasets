To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transition-Based Parsing for Deep Dependency Structures" by Xun Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are foundational to their research. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of specific datasets or benchmarks.

Then, I will examine the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. This section is crucial as it usually lists the datasets explicitly, along with descriptions of their characteristics, such as the number of samples, types of annotations, and any relevant splits (e.g., training, validation, test).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

In this paper, I expect to find references to datasets such as:

1. **CCGBank**: A corpus of CCG derivations and dependency structures extracted from the Penn Treebank.
2. **DeepBank**: A dynamically annotated treebank of the Wall Street Journal.
3. **EnjuBank**: A corpus for semantic dependency parsing.

I will ensure to extract the full citations for these datasets, which may look like this:

- For **CCGBank**:
  > Hockenmaier, Julia and Mark Steedman. *CCGBank: A corpus of CCG derivations and dependency structures extracted from the Penn treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 33(3):355–396, 2007.

- For **DeepBank**:
  > Flickinger, Dan, Yi Zhang, and Valia Kordoni. *Deepbank: A dynamically annotated treebank of the Wall Street journal*. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Workshop on Treebanks and Linguistic Theories, pages 85–96, 2012.

- For **EnjuBank**:
  > Miyao, Yusuke and Jun’ichi Tsujii. *Feature forest models for probabilistic HPSG parsing*. Computational Linguistics, 34(1):35–80, 2008.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications.
