To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lingua: Addressing Scenarios for Live Interpretation and Automatic Dubbing" by Nathan J. Anderson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the Lingua application but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **section 3 (Speech-to-Speech Pipeline)**, where the authors discuss the components of their system.

In the **introduction**, the authors describe the application and its capabilities but do not specify any datasets. Moving to **section 3**, they mention that the ASR component has been customized with "50+ hours of audio from Church speeches and their aligned human transcriptions." This indicates that there is a dataset related to Church speeches, but I need to find more details.

Next, I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **evaluation section** (section 4.2). Here, the authors state that they developed a test set containing "62 minutes of speech that has been hand-annotated with time stamps and gold-standard labels." This test set includes recordings from "6 different speakers, representing multiple age ranges, genders, and nationalities." This is another dataset that I need to document.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used (like the Church speeches or the test set). Therefore, I will note that these datasets are derived from the authors' own work and do not have external citations.

To summarize, I have identified two datasets:
1. **Church Speech Dataset**: Contains 50+ hours of audio from Church speeches with aligned human transcriptions.
2. **Fuzzy Matching Test Set**: A test set with 62 minutes of hand-annotated speech from 6 speakers.

Since these datasets do not have formal citations from external sources, I will note them as internal datasets created by the authors.

Finally, I will compile the information about these datasets into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I clearly indicate the lack of external citations for these specific datasets.
