To extract datasets from the research paper titled "(Re)ranking Meets Morphosyntax: State-of-the-art Results from the SPMRL 2013 Shared Task" by Anders Björkelund et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the authors' contributions to the SPMRL 2013 Shared Task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, especially since they mention achieving state-of-the-art results.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of parsing morphologically rich languages (MRLs) and their approach to the shared task. They mention the use of high-quality preprocessing and (re)ranking, which implies that they utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

I will then look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or experiments sections. In this paper, the authors describe their preprocessing steps and the various languages they worked with, which indicates that they likely used multiple datasets corresponding to these languages.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors reference several treebanks for different languages, which are crucial datasets for their experiments. The specific datasets mentioned include:

1. **Penn Arabic Treebank**: This dataset is used for Arabic language parsing and is referenced multiple times throughout the paper.
2. **Basque Dependency Treebank**: This dataset is used for parsing the Basque language.
3. **French Treebank**: This dataset is utilized for parsing French.
4. **Hebrew Treebank**: This dataset is referenced for Hebrew language parsing.
5. **German Treebank**: This dataset is mentioned for parsing German.
6. **Hungarian Dependency Treebank**: This dataset is used for Hungarian.
7. **Korean Treebank**: This dataset is referenced for Korean language parsing.
8. **Polish Treebank**: This dataset is mentioned for Polish.
9. **Swedish Treebank**: This dataset is used for parsing Swedish.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to gather the full citations for each of these datasets. This is crucial for ensuring that I provide accurate and complete information.

The citations I find are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
