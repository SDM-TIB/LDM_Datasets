To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A multi-Teraﬂop Constituency Parser using GPUs" by John Canny, David Hall, and Dan Klein, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the parser's performance but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the challenges of constituency parsing and references the **Penn Treebank**, which is a well-known dataset in the field of natural language processing.

Next, I will look for any specific sections that might detail datasets used in the experiments. In this case, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 7) to see if the authors mention any datasets used for testing their parser. Here, they refer to the **Penn Treebank test set**, indicating that this dataset was used for evaluating their parser's performance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Penn Treebank** dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- **Penn Treebank**: 
  > Mitchell P. Marcus, Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313–330, 1993.

Since the paper primarily discusses the Penn Treebank dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Penn Treebank, ensuring that it is clear and complete, ready for any further processing or review.
