To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dependent Dirichlet Process Spike Sorting" by Jan Gasthaus et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their model using results from two publicly available neural data recordings, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the spike sorting problem and reference previous works, but they do not explicitly name any datasets. However, they mention that their work builds on existing Bayesian approaches, which may lead to datasets being referenced later in the paper.

I will then focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention that they performed experiments on a subset of a publicly available dataset consisting of simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings of cells in the hippocampus of anesthetized rats. This is a crucial point as it indicates the datasets used.

The authors provide a link to the dataset: "http://crcns.org/data-sets/hc/hc-1/", which is essential for citation purposes. They also mention that the recordings consist of two recordings from different animals, which I will note down.

In **subsection 4.2 (Results)**, the authors discuss the performance of their algorithm on the two datasets, confirming that they are indeed using two specific recordings. They provide details about the number of spikes and the characteristics of the recordings, which will help in describing the datasets.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to the dataset in [12] and [13], which are:

- **Henze et al. (2000)**: 
  > D. A. Henze, Z. Borhegyi, J. Csicsvari, A. Mamiya, K. D. Harris, and G. Buzsáki. *Intracellular features predicted by extracellular recordings in the hippocampus in vivo*. Journal of Neurophysiology, 84(1):390–400, 2000.

- **Harris et al. (2000)**: 
  > K. D. Harris, D. A. Henze, J. Csicsvari, H. Hirase, and G. Buzsáki. *Accuracy of tetrode spike separation as determined by simultaneous intracellular and extracellular measurements*. Journal of Neurophysiology, 81(1):401–414, 2000.

Although the authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, the references to these papers indicate the source of the data used in their experiments.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Dataset 1**: A recording from an extracellular tetrode and an intracellular electrode in the hippocampus of anesthetized rats, containing 3187 spikes, with 831 originating from the identified neuron.
2. **Dataset 2**: Another recording from a different animal, containing 3502 spikes, with 553 originating from the identified neuron.

I will ensure to include the relevant citations for the datasets in my final output. This structured approach allows me to comprehensively extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
