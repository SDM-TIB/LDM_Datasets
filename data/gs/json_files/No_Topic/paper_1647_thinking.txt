To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VolTAGE: Volatility Forecasting via Text Audio Fusion with Graph Convolution Networks for Earnings Calls" by Ramit Sawhney et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions the use of earnings call transcripts and audio recordings, which suggests that these may be part of the dataset.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **S&P 500 2017 Earnings Conference Calls dataset**, which consists of 559 earnings call audio recordings and their transcripts for 277 public companies in the S&P 500 index. This is a key dataset for their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- **S&P 500 2017 Earnings Conference Calls dataset**:
  > Qin, Y., & Yang, Y. (2019). What you say and how you say it matters: Predicting stock volatility using verbal and vocal cues. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 390â€“401). Florence, Italy: Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **S&P 500 2017 Earnings Conference Calls dataset**: This dataset includes 559 audio recordings of earnings calls and their corresponding transcripts for 277 companies listed in the S&P 500 index. Each call is segmented into audio clips aligned with the text spoken by the CEO.

With this information, I will prepare to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
