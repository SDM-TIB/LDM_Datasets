To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReVal: A Simple and Effective Machine Translation Evaluation Metric Based on Recurrent Neural Networks" by Rohit Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a new metric for machine translation evaluation and mention using training data derived from WMT rankings, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Computing Similarity Scores from WMT Rankings)**, where the authors describe how they derived their training data. They specifically mention using the **WMT-13 ranks corpus** to automatically generate similarity scores between reference translations and their corresponding translations. This is a key dataset for their evaluation metric.

In **Table 2**, the authors provide statistics for four different datasets derived from WMT-13:

1. **Set L**: Contains 9,559 training pairs, filtered based on variance.
2. **Set LNF**: Contains 17,855 training pairs, without variance filtering.
3. **Set L+Sick**: Contains 14,059 training pairs, augmented with 4,500 sentence pairs from the SICK training set.
4. **Set XL+Sick**: Contains 21,356 training pairs, including pairs ranked three times in addition to those in Set L+Sick.

These datasets are crucial for understanding the performance of the proposed metric.

Now, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. The WMT-13 ranks corpus is cited as follows:

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
