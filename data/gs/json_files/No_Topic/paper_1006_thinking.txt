To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Taxy.io@FinTOC-2020: Multilingual Document Structure Extraction using Transfer Learning" by Frederic Haase and Steffen Kirchhoff, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the FinTOC-2020 shared task, which suggests that there is a specific dataset related to financial document structure extraction.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors describe the training data for the FinTOC-2020 shared task. They mention that the training data consists of **52 English and 47 French financial PDF documents**, which are annotated with text and depth for each title. This section provides key details about the dataset, including the number of documents and their characteristics.

The authors also discuss the **heterogeneity of the financial documents**, noting that the number of pages ranges from 3 to 285, and the number of titles varies from 20 to 1039. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's complexity and diversity.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset used in the FinTOC-2020 shared task. The relevant citation is:

- For the FinTOC-2020 shared task dataset:
  > Najah-Imane Bentabet, Rémi Juge, Ismail El Maarouf, Virginie Mouilleron, Dialekti Valsamou-Stanislawski, and Mahmoud El-Haj. *The Financial Document Structure Extraction Shared task (FinToc 2020)*. In The 1st Joint Workshop on Financial Narrative Processing and MultiLing Financial Summarisation, pages 163–168, Barcelona, Spain (Online), December 12, 2020.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the specified requirements.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation for the FinTOC-2020 dataset, which is essential for proper attribution and reference.
