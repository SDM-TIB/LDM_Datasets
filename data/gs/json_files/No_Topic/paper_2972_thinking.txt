To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Interpreting Deep Classification Models with Bayesian Inference," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments with two popular deep convolutional classifiers trained on the **MNIST dataset** and the **CIFAR10 dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the experiments discussed in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4 (Experiment Setup), the authors explicitly state that they used the **MNIST dataset** and the **CIFAR10 dataset** for their experiments. They describe the structure of the classifiers trained on these datasets, which confirms their relevance.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **CIFAR10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

After confirming the datasets and their citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
