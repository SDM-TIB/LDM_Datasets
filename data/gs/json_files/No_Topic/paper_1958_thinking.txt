To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Graph Evolution: Towards Efficient Automatic Robot Design" by Tingwu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about their use in the experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 4, I find that the authors mention using environments such as **Fish Env** and **Walker Env** for their experiments. However, they do not provide specific dataset names but rather describe the environments in which their robotic designs were tested.

To ensure I have captured all relevant datasets, I will also check the **References section** for any cited works that may correspond to datasets or benchmarks used in the paper. This may include foundational works or datasets that are commonly used in the field of robotic design and reinforcement learning.

After identifying the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset or environment mentioned in the paper. For example, if the authors refer to the **MuJoCo** physics engine, I will include its citation:

- **MuJoCo**: 
  > Yuval Tassa, Tom Erez, and Emanuel Todorov. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on, pp. 5026â€“5033, 2012.

If there are any other datasets or environments mentioned, I will ensure to document their full citations as well.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
