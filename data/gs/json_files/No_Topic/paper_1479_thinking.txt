To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Energy Disaggregation via Discriminative Sparse Coding" by J. Zico Kolter and Siddarth Batra, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "large scale energy disaggregation task" and hints at the use of a dataset, which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 3), where the authors describe their methodology and the data they used. Here, they explicitly mention using a dataset provided by **Plugwise**, which contains hourly energy readings from **10,165 different devices in 590 homes** over a period of more than two years. This is a crucial piece of information that indicates the dataset's size and scope.

In this section, the authors also categorize the devices into **ten broad categories** (lighting, TV, computer, etc.), which provides additional context about the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **acknowledgments section** to find any specific mentions of the dataset. The authors express gratitude to Plugwise for providing the data, confirming its significance in their research.

Finally, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is proprietary and provided by Plugwise, it may not have a formal citation like academic datasets. Instead, I will note the source as follows:

- **Plugwise Energy Data Set**: Contains hourly energy readings from 10,165 devices in 590 homes, collected over more than two years.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as accurately as possible, even if it is not a traditional academic reference.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
