To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Unsupervised Continual Learning and Self-Taught Associative Memory Hierarchies" by James Smith et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract introduces the concept of Unsupervised Continual Learning (UCL) and hints at using datasets for evaluation, but I need to look for specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the UCL problem and mention the use of labeled instances for classification. However, they do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section** where they describe their methodology in detail.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they evaluate their architecture using the **MNIST dataset**. They mention that the data stream includes unlabeled examples from the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:

- **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, Nov 1998.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the MNIST dataset is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be ready for any structured output or further processing.
