To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Embed Multi-Modal Contexts for Situated Conversational Agents," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "Situated Interactive Multi-Modal Conversations (SIMMC) 2.0," which suggests that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (SIMMC 2.0 Description)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the SIMMC 2.0 dataset. Here, they explain that it consists of 11,244 dialogs split into various sets (train, dev, devtest, and teststd) and describe the structure of the dialogs, including the multi-modal context and object attributes.

In this section, I will note the following details about the SIMMC 2.0 dataset:
- It is designed for multi-modal task-oriented dialog systems.
- It includes various attributes such as user utterances, system responses, and object metadata.
- The dataset is publicly available at a specified GitHub link.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SIMMC 2.0 dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Kottur, S., Moon, S., Geramifard, A., & Damavandi, B. (2021). SIMMC 2.0: A task-oriented dialog dataset for immersive multimodal conversations. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2021), Virtual Event / Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, 7-11 November, pages 4903â€“4912. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for SIMMC 2.0, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
