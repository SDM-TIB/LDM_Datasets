To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Grammatical markers and grammatical relations in the simple clause in Old French" by Nicolas Mazziotta, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper.

Next, I will examine the **theoretical grounds and major relations sections** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the analyses or examples provided. I will pay attention to any citations or references that may indicate the use of specific datasets or corpora.

As I read through the paper, I will look for any **tables, figures, or references** that might indicate the presence of datasets. If the author discusses any linguistic data or examples, I will note whether these are drawn from a specific dataset or corpus.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will check the **References section** for any citations that could correspond to datasets. This is crucial, as the full citation for each dataset is necessary for proper attribution.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract the following information for each:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains or its purpose.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as listed in the References section of the paper.

If no datasets are explicitly mentioned, I will conclude that the paper does not utilize any specific datasets for its analyses.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its full citation.
