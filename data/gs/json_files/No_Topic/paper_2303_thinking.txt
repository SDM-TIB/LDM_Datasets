To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Bilinear Learning for RGB-D Action Recognition" by Jian-Fang Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method is tested on "two public datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets used in their experiments. This is a good starting point for identifying the datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the provided text, the authors explicitly mention using the **NTU RGB+D Dataset** and the **SYSU 3D HOI dataset** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial as the citations provide the necessary attribution for the datasets used in the research. 

1. **NTU RGB+D Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Shahroudy, A., Liu, J., Ng, T.T., Wang, G. (2016). *NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1604.02808.

2. **SYSU 3D HOI Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Hu, J.F., Zheng, W.S., Ma, L., Wang, G., Lai, J. (2016). *Real-time RGB-D activity prediction by soft regression*. In: European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 280â€“296.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the key details about each dataset, such as their purpose, the types of actions they contain, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
