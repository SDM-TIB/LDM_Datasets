To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Lexical and Syntactic Features for Language Variety Identification" by Chris van der Lee and Antal van den Bosch, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on distinguishing between Netherlandic and Flemish Dutch, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to these language varieties.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Method)**, where the authors describe the collection of the corpus. They mention the **SUBTIEL corpus**, which contains over 500,000 subtitles in Dutch and English. This corpus is crucial for their experiments, as it is used to train and test the classifiers for language variety identification.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide specific statistics about the documents and tokens in the SUBTIEL corpus, indicating that it consists of 110,278 documents with a total of 148,415,312 tokens. This detailed information confirms the significance of the SUBTIEL corpus in their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SUBTIEL corpus. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the corpus itself, but it mentions that the subtitles were produced by a professional studio operating in the Netherlands and Belgium. Therefore, I will note that the corpus is derived from professional subtitles but may not have a formal citation.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **SUBTIEL Corpus**: A collection of over 500,000 subtitles in Dutch and English, used for language variety identification experiments. It contains 110,278 documents and 148,415,312 tokens.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the SUBTIEL corpus, I will note that it is derived from professional subtitles without a specific reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I clearly indicate the dataset's significance and details as described in the paper.
