To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LRE Map, a Song of Resources and Evaluation" by Riccardo Del Gratta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the paper's objectives and the context in which datasets are discussed. The abstract indicates that the paper revisits the LRE Map of Language Resources and mentions the analysis of approximately 7500 resources, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 1 (The LRE Map and its data)**, particularly subsection 1.2, where the authors provide a general overview of the data collected. They mention that the LRE Map contains information about 7453 language resources (LRs) collected from various conferences. This section is crucial as it outlines the types of resources included in the dataset.

I will then look for specific **tables and figures** that detail the datasets. For instance, the tables provide insights into the distribution of LR types, modalities, availability, and usage. I will note down the relevant tables that summarize the characteristics of the datasets.

In **section 1.3 (Metadata values and their normalization)**, the authors discuss the metadata used to describe each language resource. This section is important for understanding how the datasets are categorized and what information is available for each resource.

After gathering information from these sections, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper references the LRE Map and other related works, which may provide authoritative citations for the datasets.

The key datasets I will extract include:

1. **LRE Map Data**: This dataset includes metadata for 7453 language resources collected from various conferences. The citation for the LRE Map is:
   > Nicoletta Calzolari, Claudia Soria, Riccardo Del Gratta, Sara Goggi, Valeria Quochi, Irene Russo, Khalid Choukri, Joseph Mariani, and Stelios Piperidis. (2010). *The LRE Map*. ELRA/ILC.

2. **Conference Data**: The paper mentions data collected from 17 different conferences, which is part of the LRE Map dataset. The citation for the conference data is included in the citation for the LRE Map.

3. **Metadata for Language Resources**: The paper discusses the types of metadata used to describe language resources, which is part of the overall dataset. This is also covered under the citation for the LRE Map.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as outlined above. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets extracted from the paper, ready for further processing or review.
