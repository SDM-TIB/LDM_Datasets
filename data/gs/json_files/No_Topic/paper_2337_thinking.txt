To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building OCR/NER Test Collections" by Dawn Lawrie, James Mayfield, and David Etter, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper presents a collection of Chinese OCR-NER data, which suggests that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of evaluating NER when the input is corrupted and mention the need for a test collection. This section may provide insights into the specific datasets used or created.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the process for building the OCR-NER collection. They mention that the collection is based on the Chinese newspaper **Renmin Ribao** and consists of 427,885 tokens, 10,364 sentences, and 16,065 entities. This section is crucial as it provides details about the dataset's composition and its intended use.

The paper also includes a **dedicated section (Section 3)** titled "The Renmin OCR/NER Collection," which outlines the specifics of the dataset, including its size, the number of entities, and the types of annotations provided. This section confirms that the Renmin collection is the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors provide a link to the dataset, which is hosted on GitHub. The citation for the dataset is as follows:

- **Renmin OCR-NER Collection**:

European Language Resources Association (ELRA). Available at: https://github.com/hltcoe/cmn-renmin-ocr-ner-dataset.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. The Renmin OCR-NER collection is the primary dataset extracted from this paper, and I will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately.
