To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Transfer Learning and Domain Data Selection for the Bio-medical translation" by Noor-e-Hira et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used various corpora for their experiments, which suggests that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the corpora used. In this section, they mention both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, which are crucial for understanding their methodology.

The paper lists several datasets:

1. **EMEA Corpus**: This is an in-domain corpus used for training, specifically for biomedical translations.
2. **Scielo Corpus**: Another in-domain corpus that contributes to the training data.
3. **Medline Abstracts**: This corpus is also in-domain and is used for training purposes.
4. **Medline Titles**: This dataset is used as a test set.
5. **Books Corpus**: This is an out-of-domain corpus utilized in the experiments.
6. **News Commentary Corpus**: This general domain corpus is used for information retrieval to select relevant sentences.

In **Table 1**, the authors summarize the details of their training, development, and test sets, which provides additional context about the size and structure of these datasets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **EMEA Corpus**, the citation is:

- For the **Scielo Corpus**, the citation is:

In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016), Paris, France. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

- For the **Medline Abstracts**, the citation is:
  > Yepes, A. J., Név´eol, A., & Verspoor, K. (2017). Findings of the WMT 2017 biomedical translation shared task. In Proceedings of the Second Conference on Machine Translation, pages 234–247.

- For the **Books Corpus**, the citation is:
  > No specific citation is provided in the paper, but it is commonly referenced in the context of language modeling and machine translation.

- For the **News Commentary Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Tiedemann, J. (2012). Parallel data, tools and interfaces in opus. In Proceedings of the Eight International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’12), Istanbul, Turkey. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the study.
