To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Discourse Sense Classification from Scratch using Focused RNNs" by Gregor Weiss and Marko Bajec, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a system evaluated on English and Chinese datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention the CoNLL 2016 Shared Task, which is based on the English Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) and the Chinese Discourse TreeBank (CDTB). This gives me the names of the datasets I need to extract.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention that the training dataset for English consists of 1756 documents with 15246 discourse relations categorized into 15 different senses, sourced from the PDTB. For Chinese, they mention that the training dataset from CDTB consists of 455 documents with 2445 discourse relations categorized into 10 different senses. This confirms the datasets and their characteristics.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB)**, the citation is:
   > Rashmi Prasad, Nikhil Dinesh, Alan Lee, Eleni Miltsakaki, Livio Robaldo, Aravind Joshi, and Bonnie Webber. *The Penn Discourse TreeBank 2.0*. In Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC), pages 2961–2968, 2008.

2. For the **Chinese Discourse TreeBank (CDTB)**, the citation is:
   > Yuping Zhou and Nianwen Xue. *PDTB-style Discourse Annotation of Chinese Text*. In Proceedings of the 50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 69–77, 2012.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations. I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
