To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Other Learner Corpora in the 2013 NLI Shared Task" by Julian Brooke and Graeme Hirst, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss the methodology and results**. The abstract mentions the use of external corpora for training data, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the TOEFL-11 corpus, which is a key dataset for their work. I will note this down as it is likely to be one of the primary datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (External Corpora)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets they utilized for the open-training tasks. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **Lang-8**: A website where language learners write journal entries in their L2, which has been shown to be useful for NLI. The authors collected a total of 212k entries for this task.

2. **International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE)**: A collection of college student essays from 15 L1 backgrounds, which is noted as a close match in genre and proficiency to the TOEFL-11.

3. **First Certificate in English (FCE)**: A small sample of the Cambridge Learner Corpus, which consists of short answers in various formats, representing 16 different L1 backgrounds.

4. **International Corpus of Crosslinguistic Interlanguage (ICCI)**: An essay corpus focused on young learners, which includes descriptive and argumentative essays.

5. **International Corpus Network of Asian Learners of English (ICANLE)**: A collection of essays from college students in 10 Asian countries.

6. **Indian Corpora**: This includes datasets collected from Indian news articles, tweets, and blogs, specifically targeting Hindi and Telugu speakers.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations I need to extract include:

- For **TOEFL-11**:
  > Daniel Blanchard, Joel Tetreault, Derrick Higgins, Aoife Cahill, and Martin Chodorow. 2013. *TOEFL11: A corpus of non-native English*. Technical report, Educational Testing Service.

- For **Lang-8**:
  > Julian Brooke and Graeme Hirst. 2012b. *Robust, lexicalized native language identification*. In Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING ’12).

  > Yukio Tono, Yuji Kawaguchi, and Makoto Minegishi, editors. 2012. *Developmental and Cross-linguistic Perspectives in Learner Corpus Research*. John Benjamins, Amsterdam/Philadelphia.

- For **ICANLE**:
  > Shin’ichiro Ishikawa. 2011. *A new horizon in learner corpus studies: The aim of the ICNALE project*, pages 3–11. University of Strathclyde Press, Glasgow, UK.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their full citations as required.
