To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the LREC 2020 4th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Code Switching," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research focus and may mention specific datasets used in the studies presented. I will look for any explicit references to datasets or corpora related to code-switching.

Next, I will examine the **individual papers listed in the table of contents**. Each paper may introduce its own dataset or resource. I will read through the titles and abstracts of these papers to identify any that specifically mention datasets. For example, the paper titled "A New Dataset for Natural Language Inference from Code-mixed Conversations" likely contains information about a dataset that I need to extract.

Once I identify potential datasets, I will delve into the **main body of each relevant paper**. I will focus on sections that typically describe datasets, such as the **methodology or experiments sections**. Here, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their size, structure, and any unique characteristics.

For each dataset identified, I will also check the **references section** of the respective papers to find the full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if I find that the paper "A New Dataset for Natural Language Inference from Code-mixed Conversations" introduces a dataset, I will summarize its key features and then locate its citation in the references.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as part of my final output. This will ensure that the datasets are properly credited and can be easily referenced by others.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information in a clear and structured manner, ready for any further processing or presentation.
