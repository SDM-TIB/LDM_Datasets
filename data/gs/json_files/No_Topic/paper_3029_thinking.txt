To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Self-Training through Spaced Repetition" by Hadi Amiri, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of self-training algorithms on publicly available datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the author explicitly mentions the datasets used for evaluation. The section outlines two datasets:

1. **IMDb Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification, containing 50,000 labeled movie reviews. The paper specifies that for their experiments, they randomly sample instances to create training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Churn Dataset**: This dataset consists of over 5,000 tweets about three telecommunication brands, developed for churn prediction tasks. The paper mentions that they also crawled an additional 100,000 tweets for unlabeled data.

In the **statistics table (Table 3)**, the author provides detailed information about the distribution of labeled and unlabeled data for both datasets, which further confirms their usage in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **IMDb Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L Maas, Raymond E Daly, Peter T Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics: Human language technologies-volume 1, pages 142–150, 2011. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **Churn Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hadi Amiri and Hal Daumé III. *Target-dependent churn classification in microblogs*. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pages 2361–2367, 2015. AAAI Press.

With this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured output for further processing or review.
