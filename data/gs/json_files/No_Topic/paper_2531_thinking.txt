To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-Parametric Structure-Based Calibration of Radially Symmetric Cameras" by Federico Camposeco et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses the context and importance of wide field of view (WFOV) cameras but does not specify datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their methods. In this section, they mention conducting experiments with both **synthetic data** and **real data**. 

1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors describe using synthetic data to evaluate their method, specifically mentioning that they populated the scene with 320 data points distributed randomly. However, they do not provide a formal dataset citation for this synthetic data, as it is generated for the purpose of the experiments.

2. **Real Data**: The authors tested their method on several different cameras and lenses, including:
   - **Nikon D300 with fisheye lens**
   - **360One VR catadioptric lens**
   - **Spherical catadioptric lens**
   - **iPhone 4 with GoPano catadioptric attachment**

While they describe the types of cameras used, they do not provide specific datasets or citations for the real data collected. They mention that the SfM model used consists of a large-scale reconstruction obtained in an outdoor location, but again, no formal dataset citation is provided.

After reviewing the **References section**, I will note that the authors reference various works related to camera calibration and structure-from-motion, but they do not cite any specific datasets. The references primarily consist of papers that discuss methodologies and tools rather than datasets.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses the use of synthetic and real data for experiments, it does not provide specific datasets with formal citations. Therefore, I will document the findings as follows:

- **Synthetic Data**: No formal citation available; data generated for experiments.
- **Real Data**: Various cameras used, but no specific dataset citations provided.

Since no formal datasets with citations are available in the paper, I will summarize the findings without creating structured dataset entries.
