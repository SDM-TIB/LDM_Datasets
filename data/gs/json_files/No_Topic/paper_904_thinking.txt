To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Protecting Proprietary Data: Poisoning for Secure Dataset Release," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on **ImageNet classification** and **facial recognition**, which suggests that these datasets are relevant to their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experimental results** sections. In section 3 (Experimental Results), the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: The paper states that ImageNet consists of over 1 million images from 1000 classes. This dataset is used to test the proposed method on an industrial scale.

2. **CIFAR-10**: The authors describe CIFAR-10 as containing 50,000 images from 10 classes, which is also used for baseline comparisons in their experiments.

Additionally, in section 4 (Facial Recognition), the authors discuss the **CelebA dataset**, which contains 10,177 identities and is used for facial recognition tasks. They also mention other datasets used for verification, including **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)**, **Celebrities in Frontal-Profile (CPF)**, **AgeDB**, and **VGGFace2**.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., Berg, A. C., and Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, December 2015. doi: 10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:

- For **AgeDB**, the citation is:
  > Moschoglou, S., Papaioannou, A., Sagonas, C., Deng, J., Kotsia, I., and Zafeiriou, S. *AgeDB: The First Manually Collected, In-the-Wild Age Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pp. 51–59, 2017.

- For **VGGFace2**, the citation is:
  > Cao, Q., Shen, L., Xie, W., Parkhi, O. M., and Zisserman, A. *VGGFace2: A Dataset for Recognising Faces Across Pose and Age*. In 2018 13th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition (FG 2018), pp. 67–74, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing or review.
