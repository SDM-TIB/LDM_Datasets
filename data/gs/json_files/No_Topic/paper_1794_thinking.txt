To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Impact du franÃ§ais inclusif sur les outils du TAL" by Cyril Grouin, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on the performance of NLP tools on language productions in French Inclusive language, but it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the linguistic aspects of French Inclusive language but does not mention specific datasets either.

Moving on to the **methods section**, I will look for any details about the corpus used in the study. In section 3.2, the author describes the corpus, which consists of short excerpts from political speeches published on the Vie publique website and content from French government sites. The corpus is composed of 21 files, and the author notes that the final corpus includes 1313 words and 56 portions of text in French Inclusive language.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if there are any additional details about the datasets used. However, the focus remains on the performance of NLP tools rather than on specific datasets.

Finally, I will refer to the **references section** to find any citations related to the corpus. The author mentions that the corpus is available at a specific GitHub repository: https://github.com/grouin/corpus-francais-inclusif.git. This link serves as the citation for the dataset used in the study.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as follows:

- **Corpus of French Inclusive Language**: This dataset consists of excerpts from political speeches and government publications, specifically designed to evaluate NLP tools on French Inclusive language. The dataset is available at:
  > Grouin, C. (2022). *Corpus of French Inclusive Language*. Available at: https://github.com/grouin/corpus-francais-inclusif.git

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
