To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Name-aware Machine Translation" by Haibo Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a new MT metric and experiments on Chinese-English translation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using a large Chinese-English MT training corpus collected from various sources, including newswire, web text, and broadcast conversations. This indicates that there is a significant dataset involved, but I need to extract specific names and details.

In Section 5.1, the authors provide more details about the datasets. They mention that the training corpus includes **1,686,458 sentence pairs** and that the data was collected or made available by the LDC for various programs, including TIDES, GALE, and BOLT. However, they do not provide specific names for individual datasets, which is crucial for citation.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any specific datasets are cited. The authors refer to several works that may have used these datasets, but they do not provide a formal citation for the datasets themselves. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are derived from LDC resources but will not be able to provide specific citations for them.

Next, I will summarize the findings:
1. **Chinese-English MT Training Corpus**: This dataset is derived from various sources, including newswire, web text, and broadcast conversations. It consists of **1,686,458 sentence pairs**. However, specific citations for this dataset are not provided in the paper.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets, I will note that the datasets are associated with LDC programs but will not be able to provide full citations as required.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the lack of specific citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper.
