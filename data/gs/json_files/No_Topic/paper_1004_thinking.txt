To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inducing Latent Semantic Relations for Structured Distributional Semantics" by Sujay Kumar Jauhar and Eduard Hovy, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention two specific tasks: a word-pair similarity scoring task and a synonym selection task. I will look for the datasets associated with these tasks.

In **section 4.1 (Word-Pair Similarity Scoring Task)**, the authors refer to the **WS-353 dataset**, which consists of 353 pairs of words along with similarity scores. This dataset is crucial for understanding how well the proposed model performs in measuring semantic similarity.

In **section 4.2 (Synonym Selection Task)**, the authors mention the **ESL dataset**, which contains 50 target words with four candidate synonyms each. This dataset is used to evaluate the model's ability to select semantically similar words.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **WS-353 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lev Finkelstein, Evgeniy Gabrilovich, Yossi Matias, Ehud Rivlin, Zach Solan, Gadi Wolfman, and Eytan Ruppin. *Placing search in context: The concept revisited*. In ACM Transactions on Information Systems, volume 20, pages 116–131, January 2002.

- For the **ESL dataset**, the citation is:
  > Peter D. Turney. *Mining the web for synonyms: Pmi-ir versus lsa on toeﬂ*. CoRR, 2002.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the experiments conducted.
