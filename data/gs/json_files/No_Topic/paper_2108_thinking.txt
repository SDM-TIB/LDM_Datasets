To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Demo Application for the AutoGOAL Framework" by Suilan Estevez-Velarde et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, evaluation, and references sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the AutoGOAL framework but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in machine learning and the role of AutoML, but they do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **evaluation section**, where the authors compare AutoGOAL with other AutoML tools and mention its application to different datasets.

In **section 4 (Evaluation)**, the authors state that AutoGOAL has been evaluated on classic datasets and specifically mention two datasets:

1. **HAHA Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of humor analysis based on human annotation. It is used for text classification tasks within the AutoGOAL framework.

2. **MEDDOCAN Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in relation to entity recognition in medical documents. It is used to evaluate AutoGOAL's performance in a more complex domain.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **HAHA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Luis Chiruzzo, S Castro, Mathias Etcheverry, Diego Garat, Juan José Prada, and Aiala Rosá. *Overview of haha at iberlef 2019: Humor analysis based on human annotation*. In Proceedings of the Iberian Languages Evaluation Forum (IberLEF 2019). CEUR Workshop Proceedings, CEUR-WS, Bilbao, Spain, September 2019.

- For the **MEDDOCAN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alicia Lara-Clares and Ana Garcia-Serrano. *Key phrases annotation in medical documents: Meddocan 2019 anonymization task*. In Proceedings of the Iberian Languages Evaluation Forum (IberLEF 2019). CEUR Workshop Proceedings, CEUR-WS, Bilbao, Spain, September 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
