To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multilingual Summarization with Polytope Model" by Natalia Vanetik and Marina Litvak, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses the problem of extractive summarization but does not specify datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any references to specific datasets or corpora that were utilized in their experiments. 

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors mention their participation in the **MultiLing 2015 contest**, which involved summarization tasks in three languages: English, Hebrew, and Arabic. However, they do not provide specific names of datasets used for these tasks. Instead, they refer to the corpora associated with the contest.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers that might describe the datasets used in the MultiLing contest. I will look for any references that might detail the datasets or corpora used for the summarization tasks.

After reviewing the references, I find the following relevant citations:

1. **MultiLing 2015 Contest**: The datasets used for the MultiLing 2015 contest are not explicitly cited in the paper, but they are likely derived from the contest's official documentation or associated publications. I will note that the authors participated in this contest and used the provided corpora for their experiments.

2. **General References**: The authors reference several papers related to summarization and linear programming, but none of these directly provide dataset citations. 

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, I will summarize my findings as follows:

- The authors utilized datasets from the **MultiLing 2015 contest** for their experiments, which involved summarization tasks in English, Hebrew, and Arabic. However, specific dataset citations are not provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the datasets used, even if they are not explicitly named, while ensuring to note the lack of specific citations.

In conclusion, I will document that the datasets are associated with the MultiLing 2015 contest and that the authors did not provide detailed citations for these datasets in the paper.
