To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interoperability of cross-lingual and cross-document event detection" by Piek Vossen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions testing the system on a **Wikinews corpus of 120 English articles** that have been manually translated to Spanish and Dutch. This indicates that the dataset used for evaluation is the Wikinews corpus.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions in the **introduction** and **evaluation sections**. The introduction discusses the need for cross-document event coreference and mentions the use of the Wikinews corpus, confirming its significance in the study.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide more context about the dataset. They state that they created an evaluation corpus from English Wikinews articles, selecting four different topics and manually annotating the English corpus for various layers, including entities, events, and time-expressions. This further solidifies the importance of the Wikinews corpus in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** for the full citation of the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the Wikinews corpus in the references, but they mention that it consists of 120 articles, which were manually translated into Spanish and Dutch. 

Since the Wikinews corpus is a publicly available dataset, I can provide a general citation format for it, which is commonly used in academic references:

- **Wikinews Corpus**: 
  > Wikinews. *Wikinews Articles*. Available at: https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Main_Page (Accessed: [insert date]).

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Wikinews corpus as it is crucial for proper attribution in research.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Confirm the dataset details in the evaluation section.
3. Locate the citation for the dataset in the references.
4. Prepare the dataset entry with the full citation for documentation.
