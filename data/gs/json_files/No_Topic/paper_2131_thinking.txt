To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stacking With Auxiliary Features for Visual Question Answering" by Nazneen Fatema Rajani and Raymond J. Mooney, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task and mentions the use of various models, but it does not specify any datasets yet.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors reference the VQA task and its challenges. They mention that the VQA models are evaluated on the VQA dataset, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their work.

Moving on to **section 4 (Using Explanations)**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets. Here, the authors describe the VQA dataset in detail, including its structure and the number of images and questions. They provide a summary table (Table 1) that outlines the splits of the VQA dataset, which includes:

- **Training set**: 82,783 images and 248,349 questions
- **Validation set**: 40,504 images and 121,512 questions
- **Test set**: 81,434 images and 244,302 questions

This confirms that the VQA dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VQA dataset. The authors cite the original paper that introduced the VQA dataset:

- For the **VQA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stanislaw Antol, Aishwarya Agrawal, Jiasen Lu, Margaret Mitchell, Dhruv Batra, C. Lawrence Zitnick, and Devi Parikh. *VQA: Visual Question Answering*. In The IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **VQA Dataset**: This dataset is used for the Visual Question Answering task, consisting of images from the MS COCO dataset with associated questions and answers.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for each dataset identified.
