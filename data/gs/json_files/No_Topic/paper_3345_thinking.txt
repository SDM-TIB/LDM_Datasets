To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-task learning for interpretable cause-of-death classification using key phrase prediction" by Serena Jeblee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on cause-of-death classification using verbal autopsy narratives, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of verbal autopsies (VAs) and their importance in understanding causes of death in regions with limited medical documentation. This section may not explicitly mention datasets, but it sets the stage for understanding the data's relevance.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** (section 3), where the authors describe their dataset in detail. They mention that their dataset consists of **12,045 records of adult deaths from the Million Death Study (MDS)**. This is a clear identification of the dataset used in their research.

The authors provide additional context about the MDS, explaining that it is a program to collect and code VAs from India. They also describe the coding process involving physicians and the categorization of ICD-10 codes into broader cause-of-death categories. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the Million Death Study. The relevant citations are:

- For the Million Death Study, the citation is:
  > Westly, E. (2013). Global health: One million deaths. *Nature*, 504(7478), 22â€“23.

- Additionally, the authors reference other works related to the MDS, which may provide further context or validation for the dataset, but the primary citation for the dataset itself is the one above.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for a clear and accurate representation of the dataset used in the study.
