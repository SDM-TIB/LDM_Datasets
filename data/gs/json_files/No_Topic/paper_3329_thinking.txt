To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Design of BCCWJ-EEG: Balanced Corpus with Human Electroencephalography" by Yohei Oseki and Masayuki Asahara, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract introduces the BCCWJ-EEG as a novel language resource, which suggests that it is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets. In this paper, the **Design of BCCWJ-EEG** section (Section 3) is crucial as it describes the dataset in detail. Here, the authors mention that BCCWJ-EEG is composed of 20 Japanese newspaper articles selected from the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese (BCCWJ).

I will also check the **Related Work** section (Section 2) where the authors review other language resources. They mention several datasets, including:

1. **Dundee Corpus**: This dataset is described as an eye-tracking corpus composed of 20 English newspaper articles annotated with eye-tracking data from 10 English and 10 French participants.
2. **Potsdam Sentence Corpus**: This dataset consists of 144 German sentences annotated with eye-tracking data from 222 participants.
3. **Natural Stories Corpus**: This corpus includes 10 English stories annotated with self-paced reading data from 19 participants and fMRI data from 78 participants.
4. **Ghent Eye-Tracking Corpus (GECO)**: This dataset consists of an English novel annotated with eye-tracking data from 14 English native speakers and 19 Dutch-English bilingual speakers.
5. **UCL Corpus**: This EEG corpus includes 205 English sentences annotated with EEG data from 24 participants.
6. **Alice Corpus**: This dataset consists of the first chapter of "Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland" annotated with EEG data from 52 participants.
7. **Zurich Cognitive Language Processing Corpus (ZuCo)**: This corpus includes about 1000 English sentences annotated with EEG and eye-tracking data from 12 participants.
8. **BCCWJ**: The Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese, which is the source for the BCCWJ-EEG dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will locate the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

The citations I will extract include:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
