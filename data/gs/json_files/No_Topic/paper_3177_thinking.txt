To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Causal-TGAN: Causally-Aware Tabular Data Generative Adversarial Network," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the experiments. The abstract mentions "extensive experimental results on both simulated and real-world datasets," which indicates that there are multiple datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 5.1**, they mention using both simulated datasets and real-world datasets. The simulated datasets are generated using Bayesian networks, while the real-world datasets include:

1. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for classification tasks and is available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
2. **Census Dataset**: Another classification dataset, also available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
3. **Intrusion Dataset**: This dataset is used for intrusion detection and is available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
4. **News Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting online news popularity and is available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

In **section 5.1**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of columns and types of data (binary, categorical, continuous). 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Adult Dataset**:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI machine learning repository. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult

- For the **Census Dataset**:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI machine learning repository. Retrieved from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income

- For the **Intrusion Dataset**:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI machine learning repository. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/kdd+cup+1999+data

- For the **News Dataset**:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI machine learning repository. Retrieved from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+news+popularity

Additionally, the paper mentions simulated datasets generated from Bayesian networks, but specific names or citations for these datasets are not provided, as they are likely created for the purpose of the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and comprehensively.
