To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AnaLog: Testing Analytical and Deductive Logic Learnability in Language Models" by Samuel Ryb et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the AnaLog task, which is a natural language inference task, and hints at the existence of a dataset designed for this purpose.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset Design and Construction)**, where the authors describe the AnaLog dataset in detail. Here, they mention that AnaLog contains a total of **24,000 items**, each consisting of a premise, a hypothesis, and their logical relation (entailment or non-entailment). This section provides crucial information about the dataset's structure and purpose.

In this section, I will also look for any references to other datasets that may have been used in the construction of AnaLog. The authors mention extending the **LAKNLI dataset** (Ryb and Van Schijndel, 2021) to create AnaLog. This indicates that the LAKNLI dataset is relevant and should be included in my extraction.

Now, I will gather the full citations for both datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **AnaLog Dataset**: Since this dataset is introduced in the paper itself, I will cite it as follows:
   > Ryb, S., Giulianelli, M., Sinclair, A., & FernÃ¡ndez, R. (2022). AnaLog: Testing Analytical and Deductive Logic Learnability in Language Models. In Proceedings of the 11th Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics, pages 55-68.

2. **LAKNLI Dataset**: The citation for the LAKNLI dataset is:
   > Ryb, S., & Van Schijndel, M. (2021). Learning Analytical and Deductive Logic from Natural Language Inference. In Proceedings of the 2021 Workshop on Computing Semantics with Types, Frames and Related Structures.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include details such as the dataset name, description, and citation, which are essential for proper attribution and further research.
