To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Entity Disambiguation with Web Links" by Andrew Chisholm and Ben Hachey, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions experiments comparing web link models to Wikipedia models on well-known **CoNLL** and **TAC** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly focusing on **section 3 (Tasks and Data)**, where the authors describe the evaluations and datasets in detail. In this section, they mention:

1. **CoNLL Dataset**: This dataset is described as a corpus of Reuters newswire annotated for whole-document named entity recognition and disambiguation. It is based on the widely used NER data from the CoNLL 2003 shared task, which includes training and test splits.

2. **TAC 2010 Dataset**: This dataset is part of the Text Analysis Conference's annual entity linking shared task. It includes a collection of news articles and web log data, with specific training and test queries.

I will then confirm the details of these datasets by checking the **tables** and **figures** in the paper, particularly **Table 1**, which summarizes the datasets used for disambiguation tasks, including the number of documents, entities, and mentions for both CoNLL and TAC datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CoNLL dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hoffart, J., Yosef, M. A., Bordino, I., Fürstenau, H., Pinkal, M., Spaniol, M., Taneva, B., Thater, S., & Weikum, G. (2011). Robust disambiguation of named entities in text. In Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 782–792).

- For the **TAC 2010 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ji, H., & Grishman, R. (2011). Knowledge base population: Successful approaches and challenges. In Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 1148–1158).

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the documentation process. This will prepare the dataset entries for any required structured output or further analysis.
