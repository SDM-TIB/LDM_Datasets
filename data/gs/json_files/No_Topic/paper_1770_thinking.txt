To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bypassing Optimization Complexity through Transfer Learning & Deep Neural Nets for Speech Intelligibility Improvement" by Ritujoy Biswas, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the research focus on speech intelligibility improvement, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** closely. In these sections, the author describes the use of a Trapezoidal Delta function and a Gaussian delta function for formant shifting, but again, there is no direct mention of specific datasets. However, the experiments section does reference the Short Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) measure, which is a metric rather than a dataset.

I will also look for any tables or figures that might indicate the use of datasets. In **Table 1**, the results are presented for various combinations of language and noise types, but no specific datasets are named. The paper seems to focus more on the methodologies and results rather than on specific datasets.

Since there are no explicit datasets mentioned in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works involve datasets that could be relevant. The references include works by Nathwani et al. (2016), Rahmati et al. (2014), and Taal et al. (2010). 

Upon reviewing these references:
- The work by Nathwani et al. discusses formant shifting for speech intelligibility improvement in a car noise environment, which may imply the use of a dataset related to speech in noisy environments, but it does not provide a specific dataset name.
- The paper by Rahmati et al. focuses on optimization techniques and does not mention datasets.
- The work by Taal et al. presents a measure for intelligibility but does not specify datasets either.

Given that the paper does not provide any specific datasets or their citations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this research paper.

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses methodologies and results related to speech intelligibility, it does not explicitly mention or provide citations for any datasets. Therefore, I will not create any dataset entries as there are none to report.
