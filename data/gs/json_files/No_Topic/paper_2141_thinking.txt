To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Sample Reweighting for Adversarial Robustness," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on **MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100**. I will take note of these datasets as they are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

I will then look for any specific details about these datasets in the text. For instance, the authors mention that they evaluate their method on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, which are well-known datasets for image classification tasks. They also refer to CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, which are standard datasets used in machine learning for evaluating image classification algorithms.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. Here are the citations I will extract:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

2. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. CoRR, abs/1708.07747, 2017. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07747.

3. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. URL: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

4. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-100 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. URL: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for any future reference or analysis.
