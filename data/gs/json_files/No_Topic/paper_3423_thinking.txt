To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SciPar: A Collection of Parallel Corpora from Scientific Abstracts" by Dimitris Roussis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and corpus description sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the SciPar dataset, indicating that it includes 9.17 million segment alignments in 31 language pairs, which suggests that this is a significant dataset.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional context or details about the dataset. The authors discuss the importance of parallel corpora in machine translation and highlight the unique aspects of the SciPar dataset, such as its multilingual nature and the variety of scientific subjects it covers.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe how they constructed the dataset by harvesting metadata from 86 repositories. This section may provide insights into the dataset's composition and the types of data included.

The **corpus description section** is crucial as it details the number of sentence pairs for each language pair and the average LASER scores, which indicate the quality of the alignments. This section will help me understand the dataset's structure and its potential applications.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **SciPar Dataset**: This dataset consists of 9,172,462 sentence pairs across 31 language pairs, covering a wide range of scientific disciplines. It is publicly available via the ELRC-SHARE repository.

Next, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citation for the SciPar dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Roussis, D., Papavassiliou, V., Prokopidis, P., Piperidis, S., & Katsouros, V. (2022). SciPar: A Collection of Parallel Corpora from Scientific Abstracts. In Proceedings of the 13th Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2022), pages 2652â€“2657. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the SciPar dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper attribution and facilitate further research or usage of the dataset.
