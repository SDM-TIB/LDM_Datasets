To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Class Hierarchy for Code Comprehension" by Jiyang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but the **dataset section (Section 4)** is where I expect to find detailed information about the datasets used.

In **Section 4 (Dataset)**, the authors describe how they built a corpus by mining open-source Java projects for examples in the form of overriding-overridden method-comment tuples. They mention that they derive comments from the Javadoc API documentation, which indicates that they are using a specific dataset related to Java projects.

Next, I will look for any references to specific datasets or sources of data. The authors mention filtering out comments with non-English words and removing trivial examples, which suggests they have a structured dataset. However, they do not provide a specific name for a dataset in this section.

I will then check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The authors reference several works, including:

1. **Oracle (2020a)**: This reference discusses how to write Javadoc comments and may provide context on the dataset derived from Javadoc API documentation.
   > Oracle. 2020a. How to Write Doc Comments for the Javadoc Tool, Automatic re-use of method comments. https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html#reusingcomments.

2. **Oracle (2020b)**: This reference discusses tag conventions in Javadoc, which is relevant to the dataset they created.
   > Oracle. 2020b. How to Write Doc Comments for the Javadoc Tool, Tag Conventions. https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html#tag.

Additionally, the authors mention prior work that influenced their dataset construction, such as:
- **Movshovitz-Attias and Cohen (2013)**: This paper discusses natural language models for predicting programming comments.
   > Movshovitz-Attias, D., & Cohen, W. W. 2013. Natural Language Models for Predicting Programming Comments. In Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 35–40.

- **Panthaplackel et al. (2020)**: This work focuses on learning to update natural language comments based on code changes.
   > Panthaplackel, S., Nie, P., Gligoric, M., Li, J. J., & Mooney, R. J. 2020. Learning to Update Natural Language Comments Based on Code Changes. In Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1853–1868.

Now, I will summarize the datasets I have identified:

1. **Open-source Java Projects Dataset**: This dataset is constructed by mining open-source Java projects for overriding-overridden method-comment tuples. It is not explicitly named but is derived from the Javadoc API documentation.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided, but related to Oracle's Javadoc documentation.

2. **Javadoc API Documentation**: The authors utilize the Javadoc API documentation to derive comments, which is a crucial part of their dataset.
   - Citation: Oracle. 2020a. How to Write Doc Comments for the Javadoc Tool, Automatic re-use of method comments. https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html#reusingcomments.

3. **Related Works**: The authors reference prior works that influenced their dataset construction, which may not be datasets themselves but are relevant to the methodology.
   - Citation: Movshovitz-Attias, D., & Cohen, W. W. 2013. Natural Language Models for Predicting Programming Comments. In Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 35–40.
   - Citation: Panthaplackel, S., Nie, P., Gligoric, M., Li, J. J., & Mooney, R. J. 2020. Learning to Update Natural Language Comments Based on Code Changes. In Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1853–1868.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries and their citations for further processing.
