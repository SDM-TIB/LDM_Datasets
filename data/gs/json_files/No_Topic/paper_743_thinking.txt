To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enriched Feature Guided Refinement Network for Object Detection" by Jing Nie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments are performed on two benchmarks: **PASCAL VOC** and **MS COCO**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be detailed further in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In section 4.1, they describe the datasets:

1. **PASCAL VOC 2007**: The authors state that this dataset consists of 20 different object categories and that they perform training on the combined set of VOC 2007 trainval with 5k images and VOC 2012 trainval with 11k images, evaluating on the VOC 2007 test set with 5k images.

2. **MS COCO**: This dataset is described as more challenging, containing 80 object categories, divided into 80k training, 40k validation, and 20k test-dev images. The authors mention training on the trainval35k set and evaluating on the minival set and test-dev2015.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For **PASCAL VOC**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

- For **MS COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollar, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **PASCAL VOC 2007**
   - Description: A dataset consisting of 20 different object categories, with training on VOC 2007 trainval and VOC 2012 trainval, evaluated on the VOC 2007 test set.
   - Citation: Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

2. **MS COCO**
   - Description: A challenging dataset with 80 object categories, divided into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Citation: Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollar, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision, 2014.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
