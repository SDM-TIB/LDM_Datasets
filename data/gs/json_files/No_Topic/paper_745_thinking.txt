To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BUCC2017: A Hybrid Approach for Identifying Parallel Sentences in Comparable Corpora" by Sainik Kumar Mahata et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the work involves building a parallel corpus for the French-English language pair from a comparable corpus provided by BUCC 2017. This suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of obtaining large parallel corpora and mention the use of a comparable corpus provided by BUCC 2017. This is a strong indication that the dataset is related to the BUCC 2017 shared task.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the description of the data, the authors specify the types of data they are working with:
- **Monolingual EN corpus**: Contains English sentences formatted as tab-separated sentence_id + sentence per line.
- **Monolingual FR corpus**: Contains French sentences formatted similarly.
- **Gold standard list**: A tab-separated list of EN-FR sentence_id pairs, which is held out for test data.

These descriptions confirm the presence of datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper refers to the BUCC 2017 shared task, which is the primary source for the datasets used. The citation for the BUCC 2017 shared task is:

- For **BUCC 2017**:
  > "BUCC 2017: A Hybrid Approach for Identifying Parallel Sentences in Comparable Corpora." In Proceedings of the 10th Workshop on Building and Using Comparable Corpora, pages 56â€“59, Vancouver, Canada, August 3, 2017. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since the datasets are derived from the BUCC 2017 shared task, I will use this citation for the datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the BUCC 2017 shared task, which serves as the source for the datasets used in the research. This will ensure that the datasets are properly attributed in any subsequent structured output.
