To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-layer Annotation of the R. gveda" by Oliver Hellwig et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets or resources. The abstract indicates that the paper presents a novel annotated corpus of Vedic Sanskrit, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets. In this case, the paper discusses the creation of a multi-layer annotated corpus of the R. GVEDA, which is a significant resource for Vedic Sanskrit. I will pay close attention to sections that describe the corpus, such as **section 3 (Morpho-lexical Annotation)** and **section 5 (Merging the Annotation Layers)**, as these are likely to contain detailed information about the dataset.

In section 1 (Introduction), the authors mention that the full annotated corpus is available online under a Creative Commons license. This is a crucial piece of information, as it indicates the dataset's accessibility.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to the dataset. The paper does not explicitly list multiple datasets but focuses on the R. GVEDA as the primary resource. Therefore, I will ensure to provide the full citation for the R. GVEDA as it is the dataset being discussed.

The citation for the R. GVEDA is as follows:
> Jamison, S. W., & Brereton, J. P. t. (2014). *The Rigveda: the Earliest Religious Poetry of India*. Oxford University Press, New York.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the full citation.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Identify relevant sections that describe the dataset in detail.
3. Note the availability of the dataset and its citation from the references.
4. Compile the information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.
