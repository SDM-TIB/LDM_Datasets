To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assessing the Performance of Automatic Speech Recognition Systems When Used by Native and Non-Native Speakers of Three Major Languages in Dictation Workflows" by Julián Zapata and Andreas Søeborg Kirkedal, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiment but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the context of the research but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the experimental setup. They mention that the experiment involved a sample of speakers from three major languages: English, French, and Spanish. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets used for the ASR systems.

In the **results section**, the authors present data on task completion times and word accuracy rates for the ASR systems used. They mention that the ASR data was collected using a commercial PC-based speaker-adapted (SA) ASR system and a cloud-based speaker-independent (SI) ASR system. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets or provide citations for them, I will conclude that there are no formal datasets to extract from this paper. Instead, the authors conducted their experiments using proprietary ASR systems without referencing any external datasets.

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses the performance of ASR systems across different languages and accents, it does not provide specific datasets or citations for datasets used in the research. Therefore, I will not create any dataset entries for this paper.
