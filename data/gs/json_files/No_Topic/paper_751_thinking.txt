To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PDTB-style Discourse Annotation of Chinese Text" by Yuping Zhou and Nianwen Xue, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the discourse annotation scheme inspired by the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB), but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** more closely. Here, the authors reference the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) and its adaptations for Chinese text. However, they do not introduce any new datasets in this section.

I will then look into the **methodology and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are described or utilized. The paper discusses the annotation scheme and its adaptations but does not specify any datasets used for the experiments or evaluations.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the adaptation of an existing annotation scheme rather than introducing new datasets, I will check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets. The references include citations for the Penn Discourse TreeBank and the Chinese Treebank, which are relevant to the discourse annotation work but do not represent new datasets created by the authors.

The relevant citations I will extract are:

1. **Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB)**:
   > Prasad, R., Miltsakaki, E., Dinesh, N., Lee, A., Joshi, A., Robaldo, L., & Webber, B. (2007). *The Penn Discourse Treebank 2.0 Annotation Manual*. The PDTB Research Group.

2. **Chinese Treebank**:
   > Xue, N., Xia, F., Chiou, F. D., & Palmer, M. (2005). *The Penn Chinese TreeBank: Phrase Structure Annotation of a Large Corpus*. Natural Language Engineering, 11(2), 207â€“238.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, even if they are not newly introduced by the authors.
