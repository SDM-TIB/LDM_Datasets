To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Emotion Inference in Multi-Turn Conversations with Addressee-Aware Module and Ensemble Strategy" by Dayu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted empirical studies on three benchmark conversation datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they state that they evaluated their model on three multi-turn conversational datasets: **IEMOCAP**, **MELD**, and **EmoryNLP**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their research.

I will then look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets, which may be found in the same section or in the references. The authors mention that for more details, one should refer to the respective papers for each dataset. This implies that I need to locate the full citations for these datasets in the **References section**.

Now, I will extract the full citations for each dataset:

1. **IEMOCAP**: The citation is:
   > Carlos Busso, Murtaza Bulut, Chi-Chun Lee, Abe Kazemzadeh, Emily Mower, Samuel Kim, Jeannette N Chang, Sungbok Lee, and Shrikanth S Narayanan. *IEMOCAP: Interactive emotional dyadic motion capture database*. Language resources and evaluation, 42(4):335–359, 2008.

2. **MELD**: The citation is:
   > Soujanya Poria, Devamanyu Hazarika, Navonil Majumder, Gautam Naik, Erik Cambria, and Rada Mihalcea. *MELD: A multimodal multi-party dataset for emotion recognition in conversations*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 527–536, Florence, Italy, 2019.

3. **EmoryNLP**: The citation is:
   > Sayyed M Zahiri and Jinho D Choi. *Emotion detection on TV show transcripts with sequence-based convolutional neural networks*. In AAAI Workshops, 2018.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **IEMOCAP**: A dataset consisting of interactive emotional dyadic motion capture data.
- **MELD**: A multimodal dataset designed for emotion recognition in conversations.
- **EmoryNLP**: A dataset focused on emotion detection from TV show transcripts.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
