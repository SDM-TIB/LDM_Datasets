To extract datasets from the research paper titled "When is Lying the Right Choice?" by Federico Cerutti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodologies or experiments** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses privacy enforcement and controlled query evaluation but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction focuses on the importance of controlling information spread and mentions the use of obfuscation but does not specify any datasets.

I will then check the **background and methodology sections** for any references to datasets used in the research. The paper discusses concepts like provenance and controlled query evaluation but does not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper appears to be more theoretical and focused on frameworks rather than empirical studies with datasets, I will also look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily consist of theoretical works and do not seem to point to specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it seems that there are no explicit datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. The focus is on theoretical frameworks and methodologies rather than empirical data collection or analysis.

Since I did not find any datasets to extract, I will conclude that this paper does not provide specific datasets for citation. If I were to summarize my findings, I would note that while the paper discusses important concepts related to privacy and information sharing, it does not include any datasets that can be cited.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:
- No datasets were identified in the paper "When is Lying the Right Choice?" by Federico Cerutti et al.
- The paper focuses on theoretical frameworks and methodologies without empirical data.

This concludes my extraction process for this particular research paper.
