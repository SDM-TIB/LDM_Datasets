To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Masked Latent Semantic Modeling: an Efficient Pre-training Alternative to Masked Language Modeling" by GÃ¡bor Berend, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new pre-training technique, but it does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the introduction and methodology sections.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the reliance on large pre-trained language models (PLMs) and mentions the need for annotated corpora, hinting at the datasets used for training and evaluation. However, specific dataset names are not provided here.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the author details the datasets used for evaluation. In **Section 4.2 (Fine-tuning evaluations)**, the author lists several datasets used for fine-tuning the models, which include:

1. **CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability)**: This dataset is used for evaluating linguistic acceptability judgments.
2. **CoNLL 2003**: A dataset for named entity recognition tasks.
3. **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: This includes both matched (MNLIm) and mismatched (MNLImm) versions.
4. **MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus)**: A dataset for paraphrase identification.
5. **QNLI (Question Natural Language Inference)**: A dataset for question answering tasks.
6. **QQP (Quora Question Pairs)**: A dataset for identifying duplicate questions.
7. **RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment)**: A dataset for textual entailment tasks.
8. **SST2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: A dataset for sentiment analysis.
9. **STSB (Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark)**: A dataset for evaluating semantic similarity.
10. **WiC (Word-in-Context)**: A dataset for evaluating context-sensitive meaning representations.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
