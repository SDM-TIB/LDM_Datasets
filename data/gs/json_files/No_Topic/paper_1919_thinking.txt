To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Redundancy Localization for the Conversationalization of Unstructured Responses" by Sebastian Krause et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the preparation of a **public dataset with fine-grained redundancy labels**, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (A Testbed for Redundancy Localization)**, where the authors describe the evaluation dataset (EVAL). They explain that this dataset is constructed from pairs of potentially redundant passages from Wikipedia, which were segmented into sub-passages and manually annotated for redundancy assessment. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's origin and purpose.

The authors also mention that they used a random set of **1200 fact-seeking questions** to retrieve corresponding passages from Wikipedia, which were then used to create the dataset. They describe the labeling process involving three raters who assigned redundancy labels to segments of the passages.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper states that the dataset is publicly available at a specific URL, which is important for citation purposes.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Krause, S., Kozhevnikov, M., Malmi, E., & Pighin, D. (2017). *Redundancy Localization for the Conversationalization of Unstructured Responses*.

Available at: https://github.com/kraseb/redundancy-localization.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
