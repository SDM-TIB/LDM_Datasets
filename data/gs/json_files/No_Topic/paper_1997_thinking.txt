To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Open-domain question classification and completion in conversational information search" by Omid Mohammadi Kia et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research utilizes the **TREC CAsT 2019 track**, which suggests that this dataset is central to the study.

Next, I will focus on **Section III (The Proposed Method)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **TREC CAsT Conversational Assistant Track** and describe its components, including the **MS MARCO**, **TREC CAR**, and **Washington Post** datasets. This section provides crucial details about the datasets utilized in their research.

In **Section IV (Launching the Experiment)**, the authors provide further context about the **TREC CAsT 2019 dataset**, specifying that it includes 30 training topics and 50 assessment topics, with a total of 38 million texts across the mentioned datasets. This reinforces the importance of the TREC datasets in their work.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

1. **TREC CAsT**: The citation is:
   > J. Dalton, C. Xiong, and J. Callan. "CAsT 2019: The Conversational Assistance Track Overview." 2020.

2. **MS MARCO**: The citation is:
   > P. Bajaj et al. "MS MARCO: A Human Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset." 

3. **TREC CAR**: The citation is:
   > L. Dietz, M. Verma, F. Radlinski, N. C.-TREC. "TREC Complex Answer Retrieval Overview." 2017.

4. **Washington Post**: The citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is mentioned as part of the dataset collection.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for reference.
