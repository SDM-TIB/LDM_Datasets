To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IWPT 2020 Shared Task on Parsing into Enhanced Universal Dependencies," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research focus and may mention any datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit references to datasets or data sources.

Next, I will review the **shared task overview section** and any sections that detail the methodology or experiments. In this case, the **Overview of the IWPT 2020 Shared Task on Parsing into Enhanced Universal Dependencies** section is crucial, as it likely outlines the datasets used for the shared task. I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of languages, size, or annotations).

I will also check the **conclusion or discussion sections** for any additional insights or mentions of datasets that may not have been highlighted earlier in the paper.

Once I identify the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the **Universal Dependencies (UD) dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Nivre, J., de Marneffe, M.-C., Ginter, F., Goldberg, Y., & Manning, C. D. (2016). *Universal Dependencies v1: A multilingual treebank collection*. In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016).

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete.
