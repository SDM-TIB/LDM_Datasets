To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Remote Heart Rate Measurement From Face Videos Under Realistic Situations" by Xiaobai Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their framework on a public database called **MAHNOB-HCI**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. In **Experiment 2**, they specifically mention using the **MAHNOB-HCI database** for testing their framework. The authors provide details about this dataset, including the number of subjects involved, the type of data collected, and the conditions under which the data was recorded.

In the paper, the authors describe the **MAHNOB-HCI database** as follows:
- It includes data from two experiments: an 'emotion elicitation experiment' and an 'implicit tagging experiment'.
- The dataset consists of color videos recorded at a resolution of 780 Ã— 580 pixels at 61 fps, along with corresponding ECG signals for ground truth HR measurements.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **MAHNOB-HCI database**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Soleymani, M., Lichtenauer, J., Pun, T., & Pantic, M. (2012). A multimodal database for affect recognition and implicit tagging. *IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing*, 3(1), 1-12.

Additionally, I will note that the authors also mention a self-collected dataset called **VideoHR** in **Experiment 1**. They describe it as a simple database collected under controlled conditions, but they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset since it is not publicly available.

To summarize, I have identified the following datasets from the paper:

1. **MAHNOB-HCI Database**: A public multi-modal database used for testing the proposed framework.
   - Citation: Soleymani, M., Lichtenauer, J., Pun, T., & Pantic, M. (2012). A multimodal database for affect recognition and implicit tagging. *IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing*, 3(1), 1-12.

2. **VideoHR Database**: A self-collected dataset used for initial experiments, but no formal citation is provided as it is not publicly available.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
