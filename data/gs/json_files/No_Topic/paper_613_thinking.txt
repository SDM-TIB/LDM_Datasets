To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On learning to refer to things based on discriminative properties" by Angeliki Lazaridou, Nghia The Pham, and Marco Baroni, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Discriminative Attribute Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset they created for their experiments. They mention the **Visual Attributes for Concepts Dataset (ViSA)** as a starting point, which is crucial for understanding the dataset they are working with.

In this section, the authors explain how they derived their dataset from ViSA, including details about the number of concepts and attributes they used. They also describe how they processed the images and the resulting training pairs, which is essential for understanding the dataset's structure.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or if there are any references to other datasets used for validation or testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is critical for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

The citations I will look for include:

1. **Visual Attributes for Concepts Dataset (ViSA)**:
   - The citation for this dataset is:
     > Carina Silberer, Vittorio Ferrari, and Mirella Lapata. *Models of semantic representation with visual attributes*. In Proceedings of ACL, pages 572–582, Sofia, Bulgaria, 2013.

2. **ReferIt Dataset**:
   - The citation for this dataset is:
     > Sahar Kazemzadeh, Vicente Ordonez, Mark Matten, and Tamara L Berg. *Referitgame: Referring to objects in photographs of natural scenes*. In EMNLP, pages 787–798, 2014.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries in a structured format that highlights the key details and full citations for each dataset. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly documented and easily accessible for future reference.
