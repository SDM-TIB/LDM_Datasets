To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Scene Geometry for Visual Localization in Challenging Conditions" by Nathan Piasco et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a method for outdoor large-scale image-based localization, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. 

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention using the **Oxford Robotcar dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe how they built triplets of images for training and detail the testing scenarios. They mention that the reference dataset consists of 1688 images taken every 5 meters along a 2 km path, which is part of the Oxford Robotcar dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Oxford Robotcar dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> W. Maddern, G. Pascoe, C. Linegar, and P. Newman. "1 year, 1000 km: The Oxford RobotCar dataset." *The International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)*, 2016.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Oxford Robotcar Dataset**: This dataset is used for image-based localization and contains 1688 images taken every 5 meters along a 2 km path. It is designed to evaluate localization algorithms under various conditions.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is critical for proper attribution in research contexts.
