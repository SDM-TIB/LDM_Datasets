To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Less is More: Attention Supervision with Counterfactuals for Text Classification" by Seungtaek Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on text classification tasks, which suggests that datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment Setup)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors explicitly list three datasets:

1. **SST2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: This dataset provides around 11,000 sentences tagged with sentiment on a scale from 1 (most negative) to 5 (most positive). The authors mention that they filter out neutral samples and dichotomize the remaining sentences into positive and negative categories.

2. **IMDB (IMDB Large Movie Review Corpus)**: This dataset consists of 50,000 polarized movie reviews, split evenly into positive and negative categories for binary sentiment classification.

3. **20NG (20 Newsgroups)**: This dataset contains approximately 19,000 documents categorized into 20 different categories. The authors focus on a binary classification task by extracting samples from the baseball and hockey classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **SST2**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality over a Sentiment Treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1631–1642, 2013.

- For **IMDB**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L Maas, Raymond E Daly, Peter T Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 2011 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 142–150, 2011.

- For **20NG**, the citation is:
  > Ken Lang. *Newsweeder: Learning to Filter Netnews*. In Proceedings of the 1995 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pages 331–339, 1995.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
