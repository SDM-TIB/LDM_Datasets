To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GBD-NER at PARSEME Shared Task 2018: Multiword Expression Detection Using Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory Networks and Graph-Based Decoding" by Tiberiu Boros and Ruxandra Burtica, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental validation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their approach using standard MWE corpora supplied in the PARSEME Shared Task, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** to see if the authors provide more context about the datasets. They mention the PARSEME Shared Task, which is a key indicator that the datasets used are related to this task.

In the **experimental validation section**, the authors explicitly state that they validated their approach using the **PARSEME corpus**, which covers 19 languages and is formatted in CUPT format. This is a significant dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PARSEME corpus. The relevant citation is:

- For the **PARSEME corpus**, the citation is:
  > Carlos Ramisch, Silvio Ricardo Cordeiro, Agata Savary, Veronika Vincze, Verginica Barbu Mititelu, Archna Bhatia, Maja Buljan, Marie Candito, Polona Gantar, Voula Giouli, Tunga Güngör, Abdelati Hawwari, Uxoa Iñurrieta, Jolanta Kovalevskaitė, Simon Krek, Timm Lichte, Chaya Liebeskind, Johanna Monti, Carla Parra Escartín, Behrang QasemiZadeh, Renata Ramisch, Nathan Schneider, Ivelina Stoyanova, Ashwini Vaidya, and Abigail Walsh. *Edition 1.1 of the PARSEME Shared Task on Automatic Identification of Verbal Multiword Expressions*. In Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Linguistic Annotation, Multiword Expressions and Constructions (LAW-MWE-CxG-2018), Santa Fe, USA, August. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the PARSEME corpus, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for review or further processing.
