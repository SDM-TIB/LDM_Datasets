To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The 3D Linear Inverted Pendulum Model: A Simple Modeling for a Biped Walking Pattern Generation" by Shuuji Kajita et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets or experimental setups.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may mention specific datasets used for their experiments. If they refer to any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details.

I will then examine the **methodology** section, particularly looking for any subsections that discuss experimental setups or data collection. This section is crucial as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, size, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

After that, I will check the **results** section to see if the authors provide any additional information about the datasets, such as performance metrics or comparisons with other datasets. This can help confirm the datasets' relevance and importance to the research.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the authors mention specific datasets, I will compile the following information for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The exact title as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as found in the references section of the paper.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented with its name, description, and citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
