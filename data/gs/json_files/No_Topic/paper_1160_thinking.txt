To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control" by Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the physics engine and its capabilities, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses the need for simulation tools in robotics but does not reference specific datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for testing or validation of their physics engine. In this paper, the authors focus on the performance of MuJoCo in terms of dynamics evaluations and comparisons with other engines like SD/FAST, but they do not provide specific datasets used in their experiments.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will check the **References section** for any cited works that might include datasets relevant to the research. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing algorithms, methodologies, and previous works in robotics and control, rather than datasets themselves.

Given that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that this paper does not provide any datasets for extraction. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to report.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in the paper "MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control" and that the focus was primarily on the engine's capabilities and performance metrics rather than on specific datasets.
