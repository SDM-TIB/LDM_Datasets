To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Les temps de traitement des voix de femmes et d'hommes sont-ils équivalents ?" by Erwan Pépiot, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on processing times for male and female voices, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any mention of datasets used in the experiments. The introduction discusses previous studies and their findings but does not specify any datasets utilized in this research.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for details about the materials and recordings used in the experiments. Here, the author describes the selection of words and the recording process involving eight French-speaking speakers (four men and four women). However, there is no formal dataset mentioned; instead, the focus is on the experimental setup and the words chosen for the study.

In the **results section**, I will check for any data presented that could be considered a dataset. The author provides average response times for different conditions but does not refer to a specific dataset. The results are based on the experimental conditions rather than a pre-existing dataset.

Finally, I will review the **discussion and conclusion sections** to see if the author references any datasets or compares their findings to other studies. While the author discusses the implications of their findings and references previous research, there is no mention of a dataset.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no formal datasets provided or referenced in this study. The research is based on original experimental data collected by the author rather than on existing datasets.

Since no datasets were identified, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets. Instead, I will summarize the findings and the experimental conditions used in the study, noting that the data is original and specific to this research.

In conclusion, I will document that the paper does not contain any external datasets but rather presents original data collected during the experiments conducted by the author.
