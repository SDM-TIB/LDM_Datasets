To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GEPSA, a tool for monitoring social challenges in digital press" by Iñaki San Vicente et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a tool for monitoring narratives related to social challenges, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the analysis.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Features)**, where the authors describe the macro key indicators (KIs) for three social challenges: immigration, gender equality, and minority languages. While this section outlines the indicators, it does not explicitly mention datasets. I will continue to look for specific datasets in the subsequent sections.

In **section 3 (System architecture)**, the authors mention that they built two news datasets for thematic section classification, one for Basque and one for Spanish. They state that these datasets contain 156K and 300K classified news articles, respectively. This is a crucial finding as it directly references the datasets used in their analysis.

I will also check **section 3.5 (Social Challenge Classification)**, where the authors describe the process of creating training datasets for social challenge classification. They mention that a minimum of 2,000 documents per language and challenge were annotated, which further confirms the existence of datasets.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but it references various studies and methodologies that may be relevant to the datasets used. 

Since the datasets are derived from the authors' own work and not from external sources, I will note that the datasets are original and created for the purpose of this research. Therefore, I will create a citation for the datasets based on the paper itself:

- **Basque Thematic Section Dataset**: This dataset contains 300K classified news articles in Basque.
- **Spanish Thematic Section Dataset**: This dataset contains 156K classified news articles in Spanish.

The citations for these datasets will be:
> Iñaki San Vicente, Xabier Saralegi, Nerea Zubia. *GEPSA, a tool for monitoring social challenges in digital press*. In Proceedings of the First Workshop on Language Technology for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion, pages 46–50, April 19, 2021.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research.
