To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Multi-Object Tracking via Robust Collaborative Model and Sample Selection" by Mohamed A. Naiela et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their tracking algorithm on several sequences, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets or sequences mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this section, the authors list the datasets used for evaluation, which include:

1. **PETS09-S2L1**: This dataset consists of 799 frames of 768 × 576 pixels recorded at 7 frames per second with medium crowd density.
2. **PETS09-S2L2**: This dataset has 442 frames with the same resolution and frame rate as PETS09-S2L1 but features heavy crowd density and illumination changes.
3. **UCF Parking Lot (UCF-PL)**: This dataset contains 998 frames of 1920 × 1080 pixels recorded at 29 frames per second.
4. **Soccer Dataset**: This dataset consists of 155 frames of 960 × 544 pixels recorded at 3 to 5 frames per second.
5. **Town Center Dataset**: This dataset includes 4500 frames of 1080 × 1920 pixels recorded at 25 frames per second.
6. **Urban Sequence from LISA 2010 Dataset**: This sequence contains 300 frames of 704 × 480 pixels collected at 30 frames per second.
7. **Sunny Sequence from LISA 2010 Dataset**: Similar to the Urban sequence, this also contains 300 frames of 704 × 480 pixels.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For example, the citations for the datasets might look like this:

- **PETS09-S2L1**: 
  > J. Ferryman, "PETS09-S2L1 Dataset," in Proceedings of the IEEE Workshop Performance Evaluation of Tracking and Surveillance, 2009.

- **PETS09-S2L2**: 
  > J. Ferryman, "PETS09-S2L2 Dataset," in Proceedings of the IEEE Workshop Performance Evaluation of Tracking and Surveillance, 2009.

- **UCF Parking Lot (UCF-PL)**: 
  > S. Sivaraman and M. Trivedi, "UCF Parking Lot Dataset," in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 2010.

- **Soccer Dataset**: 
  > G. Shu et al., "Soccer Dataset," in Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2012.

- **Town Center Dataset**: 
  > B. Benfold and I. Reid, "Town Center Dataset," in Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2011.

- **Urban Sequence from LISA 2010 Dataset**: 
  > S. Sivaraman and M. Trivedi, "LISA 2010 Urban Dataset," in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 2010.

- **Sunny Sequence from LISA 2010 Dataset**: 
  > S. Sivaraman and M. Trivedi, "LISA 2010 Sunny Dataset," in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 2010.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further research and validation of the findings presented by the authors.
