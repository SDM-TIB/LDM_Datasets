To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating GAN-Based Image Augmentation for Threat Detection in Large-Scale Xray Security Images" by Joanna Kazzandra Dumagpi and Yong-Jin Jeong, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a large-scale practical X-ray image dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The Imbalanced Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used in their study. Here, they mention the **SIXray dataset**, which is the largest publicly available database for X-ray security images. They provide details about the dataset, including its composition and the number of positive and negative samples.

The authors specify that the SIXray dataset is divided into three subsets: **SIXray10, SIXray100, and SIXray1000**, each representing different imbalance ratios between positive and negative samples. They also describe the types of threats included in the dataset, such as guns, knives, wrenches, pliers, and scissors.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used the SIXray dataset for their evaluations, which reinforces the importance of this dataset in their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the SIXray dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Miao, C.; Xie, L.; Wan, F.; Su, C.; Liu, H.; Jiao, J.; Ye, Q. SIXray: A Large-scale Security Inspection X-ray Benchmark for Prohibited Item Discovery in Overlapping Images. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Long Beach, CA, USA, 15â€“20 June 2019.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **SIXray Dataset**: The primary dataset used in the study, which includes images collected in real-world security system setups, specifically subway stations. It contains a total of 8929 positive samples and over one million negative samples, divided into three subsets (SIXray10, SIXray100, and SIXray1000) based on imbalance ratios.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
