To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalizable Person Re-Identification Without Demographics," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on "large-scale DG ReID and cross-domain ReID benchmarks," which suggests that specific datasets are used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention that they evaluate their method using multiple data sources, specifically five large-scale ReID datasets: **CUHK02, CUHK03, Market1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, and CUHK-SYSU PersonSearch**. This is a crucial finding as it directly lists the datasets involved in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

1. **CUHK02 Dataset**:
   > Li, W., & Wang, X. (2013). *Locally aligned feature transforms across views*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2013.

2. **CUHK03 Dataset**:
   > Li, W., Zhang, Z., & Wang, X. (2014). *DeepReID: Deep filter pairing neural network for person re-identification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2014.

3. **Market1501 Dataset**:
   > Zheng, L., Shen, L., Tian, L., Wang, G., & Tian, Q. (2015). *Scalable person re-identification: A benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

4. **DukeMTMC-ReID Dataset**:
   > Zheng, Z., Zheng, L., & Yang, Y. (2017). *Unlabeled samples generated by GAN improve the person re-identification baseline in vitro*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017.

5. **CUHK-SYSU PersonSearch Dataset**:
   > Xiao, T., Li, S., Wang, H., & Wang, X. (2016). *End-to-end deep learning for person search*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
