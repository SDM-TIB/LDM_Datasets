To extract datasets from the research paper titled "More Efficient Topic Modelling Through a Noun Only Approach" by Fiona Martin and Mark Johnson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study compares three topic models trained on different versions of a news corpus, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data and Methods)**, where the authors describe the data used for their experiments. They mention using a specific dataset, the **San Jose Mercury News (SJMN) articles**, which is derived from the Tipster corpus. This section provides details about the corpus, including the number of articles and the total word count, confirming that this is a dataset relevant to their study.

In this section, the authors specify that the SJMN corpus consists of **90,257 articles** and contains **35.8 million words**. They also mention that part-of-speech tagging identified **12.9 million nouns**, which is significant for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the SJMN dataset is:

- **San Jose Mercury News (SJMN) articles**:
  > Harman, D., & Liberman, M. (1993). TIPSTER Complete LDC93T3A. DVD. Retrieved from https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93T3D.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information about the SJMN dataset into the required format.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the SJMN corpus, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper referencing.
