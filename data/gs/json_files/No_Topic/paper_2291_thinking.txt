To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Open Information Extraction for Spanish Language based on Syntactic Constraints" by Alisa Zhila and Alexander Gelbukh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors compare their system, EXTRHECH, with REVERB on a parallel dataset, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in **section 4 (Experiments)**. Here, the authors describe two datasets used for evaluation:

1. **News Commentary Corpus**: This dataset consists of 300 parallel sentences from the English-Spanish part of the corpus, which is used to compare the performance of EXTRHECH and REVERB. The authors provide a citation for this dataset:
   > Chris Callison-Burch, Philipp Koehn, Christof Monz, and Omar Zaidan. *Findings of the 2011 workshop on statistical machine translation*. In Proceedings of the Sixth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 22â€“64, Edinburgh, Scotland, July 2011. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **Raw Web text dataset**: This dataset is composed of 200 random data chunks extracted from the CommonCrawl 2012 corpus, which were filtered to include only grammatically correct sentences. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, but they reference the CommonCrawl project:
   > Marshall Kirkpatrick. *New 5 billion page web index with page rank now available for free from common crawl foundation*. http://readwrite.com/2011/11/07/new-5-billion-page-web-index-with-page-rank-now-available-for-free-from-common-crawl-foundation. [last visited on 25/01/2013].

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, as this is crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for further processing or review.
