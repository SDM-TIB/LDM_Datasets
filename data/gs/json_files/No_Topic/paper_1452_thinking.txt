To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Effective Spell Checking Methods Using Clustering Algorithms" by Renato Cordeiro de Amorim and Marcos Zampieri, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used an **English misspelling list compiled using real examples extracted from the Birkbeck spelling error corpus** for evaluation, which suggests that this is a key dataset.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Setting of the Experiment)**, where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They mention acquiring an **English dictionary containing 57,046 words** and a **corpus consisting of a list of 36,133 misspellings together with its 6,136 target words**. This section confirms the datasets used in their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results and conclusion sections** to ensure I capture all relevant datasets. However, it appears that the primary datasets are already identified in the methods section.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

- For the **Birkbeck spelling error corpus**, the citation is:
  > Roger Mitton. *Ordering the suggestions of a spellchecker without using context*. Natural Language Engineering, 15(2):173â€“192, 2009.

- The **English dictionary** does not have a specific citation provided in the paper, but it is noted that it contains 57,046 words, which is a standard resource used in spell checking.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the Birkbeck spelling error corpus and noting the English dictionary as a commonly used resource without a specific citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
