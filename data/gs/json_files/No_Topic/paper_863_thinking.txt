To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Annotated Social Media Corpus for German" by Eckhard Bick, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper presents a "German Twitter section of a large bilingual Social Media corpus for Hate Speech research," which suggests that there is a significant dataset involved.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (The Corpus)**, where the author discusses the corpus size and sources. Here, I will look for specific details about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. The author mentions that the XPEROHS corpus contains over 2 billion words collected from Twitter and Facebook, specifically noting the sizes for German and Danish Twitter and Facebook data.

In **subsection 2.1 (Corpus Size and Sources)**, the paper provides a breakdown of the corpus sizes:
- **German Twitter**: 1,700 million words
- **German Facebook**: 200 million words
- **Danish Twitter**: 270 million words
- **Danish Facebook**: 60 million words

This information confirms that the datasets are indeed substantial and relevant for hate speech research.

I will also check **section 6 (Acknowledgements)** and **section 8 (Language Resource References)** for any additional context or references to the datasets. The author mentions that the XPEROHS corpus is currently accessible only to project members, which is important for understanding its availability.

Now, I will look for the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the XPEROHS project, which is crucial for citation purposes. The citation for the XPEROHS project is as follows:
> Baumgarten, N., Bick, E., Geyer, K., Iversen, D. A., Kleene, A., Lind√∏, A. V., Neitsch, J., Niebuhr, O., Nielsen, R., Petersen, E. N. (2019). Towards Balance and Boundaries in Public Discourse: Expressing and Perceiving Online Hate Speech (XPEROHS). In: Mey, J., Holsting, A., Johannessen, C. (ed.): RASK - International Journal of Language and Communication. Vol. 50., pp. 87-108. University of Southern Denmark.

Additionally, I will note that the paper discusses the linguistic features and peculiarities encountered in the data, which may be relevant for understanding the dataset's context.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets from the research paper.
