To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Oriented Object Proposals" by Shengfeng He and Rynson W.H. Lau, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions experiments on the **PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is used in their research.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors discuss their experiments in detail. They specifically mention using the **PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset** for evaluating their proposed method. This section provides insights into the dataset's relevance and application in their experiments.

Additionally, the authors refer to the **Freestyle Motocross dataset** in the context of evaluating the rotation invariant property of their approach. This dataset is used for testing the performance of their method under different orientations, which is crucial for understanding the effectiveness of their proposal generation.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset**, the citation is:
   > M. Everingham, L. Gool, C. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The Pascal visual object classes (VOC) challenge*. IJCV, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

2. For the **Freestyle Motocross dataset**, the citation is:
   > M. Villamizar, F. Moreno-Noguer, J. Andrade-Cetto, and A. Sanfeliu. *Efficient rotation invariant object detection using boosted random ferns*. In CVPR, pages 1038–1045, 2010.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, which is essential for any further analysis or replication of the study.
