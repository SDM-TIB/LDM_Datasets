To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Hyperalignment for Multilingual Word Embeddings," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses aligning word representations across multiple languages and mentions evaluating the method on datasets related to multilingual word embeddings. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention using the **MUSE test datasets** for evaluation, which is a significant clue. I will note this down as it is likely a primary dataset used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their evaluation on **11 languages**: Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. They also mention that the MUSE bilingual lexicon is built with an automatic translation system, which suggests that the MUSE dataset is central to their work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MUSE dataset. The relevant citation for the MUSE dataset is:

- For **MUSE**:
  > Alexis Conneau, Guillaume Lample, Marc’Aurelio Ranzato, Ludovic Denoyer, and Hervé Jégou. *Word translation without parallel data*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.04087, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for MUSE, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format, ready for review or further processing.
