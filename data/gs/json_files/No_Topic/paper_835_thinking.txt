To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disfluences dans le vieillissement 'normal' et la maladie dâ€™Alzheimer : indices segmentaux, suprasegmentaux et gestuels" by Diane Caussade et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a summary of the study's aims and findings, which may include references to datasets used for analysis.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research, including the challenges of studying language production in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. They may reference previous studies or datasets that inform their work, which could be useful for citation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly **section 2.2 (Corpus et protocole)**, where the authors describe how they collected their data. They mention that the data were gathered from a group of 10 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 10 matched controls, indicating that the dataset consists of audio-visual recordings from specific tasks. This section may also provide details about the nature of the data collected, such as the types of tasks performed and the specific measures taken.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional insights into the datasets, such as statistical analyses performed on the data, which may further clarify the dataset's structure and content.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or tools mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for ensuring that I have accurate and complete citations for each dataset.

For example, if the authors reference a specific assessment tool or dataset used in their analysis, I will look for the original source to provide a proper citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in the appropriate format.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete for further processing or review.
