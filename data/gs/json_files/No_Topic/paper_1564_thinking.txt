To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Negotiable Reinforcement Learning for Pareto Optimal Sequential Decision-Making" by Nishant Desai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets or experimental environments. The abstract discusses implementing a simple NRL agent and examining its behavior in a simple environment, which suggests that there may be datasets or environments used for evaluation.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Evaluation)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Experiment Environment)**, where the authors describe the experimental setup. They mention using a modified version of the **FrozenLake environment** from OpenAI Gym. This indicates that the FrozenLake environment is a key dataset or environment used in their experiments.

In **subsection 4.2 (Experiments)**, the authors detail the experiments conducted with the NRL agent in the FrozenLake environment. They describe the behavior of the agent and how it interacts with the environment, confirming that this environment is central to their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FrozenLake environment. The citation for the OpenAI Gym, which includes the FrozenLake environment, is as follows:
> Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*, 2016.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the primary dataset used in this research is the **FrozenLake environment**.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citation, into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
