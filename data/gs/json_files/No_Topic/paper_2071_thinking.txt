To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Multi-label Text Categorization with Hidden Components" by Li Li, Longkai Zhang, and Houfeng Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments with "real-world data sets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three datasets:

1. **Slashdot Dataset**: This dataset is concerned with science and technology news categorization, predicting multiple labels based on article titles and partial blurbs from Slashdot.org.

2. **Medical Dataset**: This dataset involves assigning ICD-9-CM codes to radiology reports, which is a common task in medical text categorization.

3. **TMC2007 Dataset**: This dataset is focused on labeling aviation safety reports with respect to the types of problems they describe.

In this section, the authors provide some statistics about each dataset, such as the number of instances (n), dimensions (d), and label cardinality (Lcard), which helps to understand the datasets better.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Slashdot Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jesse Read, Bernhard Pfahringer, Geoff Holmes, and Eibe Frank. *Classifier chains for multi-label classification*. Machine learning, 85(3):333–359, 2011.

- For the **Medical Dataset**, the citation is:
  > John P Pestian, Christopher Brew, Paweł Matykiewicz, DJ Hovermale, Neil Johnson, K Bretonnel Cohen, and Włodzisław Duch. *A shared task involving multi-label classification of clinical free text*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on BioNLP 2007: Biological, Translational, and Clinical Language Processing, pages 97–104. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2007.

- For the **TMC2007 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ashok N Srivastava and Brett Zane-Ulman. *Discovering recurring anomalies in text reports regarding complex space systems*. In Aerospace Conference, 2005 IEEE, pages 3853–3862. IEEE, 2005.

With these citations, I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets used in the paper. I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
