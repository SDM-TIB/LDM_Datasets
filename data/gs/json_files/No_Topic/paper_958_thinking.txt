To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Localized Random Projections Benchmarks for Bio-Plausible Deep Learning" by anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the MNIST dataset, indicating that it is used for benchmarking the proposed methods. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors mention the MNIST dataset again, describing it as a popular task for testing models. This reinforces the importance of the MNIST dataset in their research.

Moving on to the **results** section, I will look for any additional datasets mentioned. The authors also discuss the CIFAR10 dataset in the context of testing their model's performance. They state that they applied their methods to CIFAR10, which is crucial for understanding the breadth of their evaluation.

In the **discussion** section, the authors reflect on the limitations of their approach when applied to more complex datasets like CIFAR10, further emphasizing its significance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

2. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *CIFAR-10 Dataset*. https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html, 2013.

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
