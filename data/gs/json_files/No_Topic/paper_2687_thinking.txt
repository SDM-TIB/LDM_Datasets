To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Traitement automatique des formes métriques des textes versifiés" by Éliane Delente and Richard Renault, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the project Anamètre, which focuses on the automatic processing of metrical forms in French poetry and drama. It mentions a corpus of 8900 poems and 75 plays, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors describe the project and its objectives. They mention the corpus analyzed, which consists of 8900 poems and 75 plays from 56 authors, totaling 540,000 verses. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

In **section 4 (Le projet dans ses grandes lignes)**, the authors outline the components of the project, including the creation of a database of annotated poetic and theatrical texts. This section confirms the existence of a dataset related to the analysis of metrical forms.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but it references the works of Benoît de Cornulier, who has contributed significantly to the field of French metrics. I will include relevant citations for his works as they pertain to the methodology and theoretical framework used in the project.

The relevant citations are:

- Cornulier, B. de (1982). *Théorie du vers*. Éditions du Seuil, Paris.
- Cornulier, B. de (1995). *Art poëtique*. Presses universitaires de Lyon.

Finally, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the works referenced in the context of the datasets. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
