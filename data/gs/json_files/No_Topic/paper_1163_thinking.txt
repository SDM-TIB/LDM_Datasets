To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Layer rotation: a surprisingly simple indicator of generalization in deep networks?" by Simon Carbonnelle and Christophe De Vleeschouwer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction. In the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of understanding generalization properties in deep neural networks but do not specify any datasets yet.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (A systematic study of layer rotation configurations with Layca)**, where the authors mention conducting experiments on five different tasks, each varying in network architecture and dataset complexity. They refer to a **Table 1** that summarizes the tasks used for their experiments, which likely includes the datasets.

Upon reviewing **Table 1**, I find the following datasets associated with the tasks:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **Tiny ImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes, with each image being 64x64 pixels.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Stanford CS231N. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or application.
