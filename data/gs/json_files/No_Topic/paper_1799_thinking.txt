To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Learning Mid-level Filters for Person Re-identification" by Rui Zhao, Wanli Ouyang, and Xiaogang Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their approach is validated on the **VIPeR dataset** and the **CUHK01 dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 5) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. They mention:

1. **VIPeR Dataset**: This dataset is described as being captured from two hand-held cameras in an outdoor academic environment, containing 632 pedestrian pairs, with each pair having two images of the same person observed from different camera views. The images are normalized to a resolution of 128 × 48 for evaluations.

2. **CUHK01 Dataset**: This dataset consists of images captured from two camera views in a campus environment, containing 971 persons, each with two images from different views. The images are normalized to a resolution of 160 × 60 for evaluations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **VIPeR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gray, D., Brennan, S., & Tao, H. (2007). Evaluating appearance models for recognition, reacquisition, and tracking. In *PETS*.

- For the **CUHK01 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, W., Zhao, R., & Wang, X. (2012). Human reidentification with transferred metric learning. In *ACCV*.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
