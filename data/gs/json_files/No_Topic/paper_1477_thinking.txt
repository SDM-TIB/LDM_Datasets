To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Debiasing Averaged Stochastic Gradient Descent to handle missing values" by Aude Sportisse et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on "real data sets, including those collected from medical register," which suggests that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors describe their empirical evaluations. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **TraumaBase Dataset**: This dataset is used to model the level of platelets upon arrival at the hospital from clinical data of 15,785 patients. The authors discuss the explanatory variables and the percentage of missing values in each variable.

2. **Superconductivity Dataset**: This dataset contains 81 quantitative features from 21,263 superconductors, and the goal is to predict the critical temperature of each superconductor. The authors also mention how they introduced missing values into this dataset.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly. Instead, I will note that the TraumaBase dataset is associated with the APHP TraumaBase Group, and the Superconductivity dataset is likely a publicly available dataset, but the authors do not provide a specific reference.

Since the TraumaBase dataset is linked to a medical register, I will cite it as follows:
- TraumaBase Dataset: APHP TraumaBase Group. *TraumaBase Dataset*. Available at: [link to dataset if available].

For the Superconductivity dataset, I will note:
- Superconductivity Dataset: *Superconductivity Dataset*. Available at: [link to dataset if available].

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and citations as accurately as possible.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and organized representation of the datasets used in the paper, ready for further analysis or processing.
