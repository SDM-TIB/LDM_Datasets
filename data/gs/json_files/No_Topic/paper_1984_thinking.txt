To extract datasets from the research paper titled "If you can’t beat them, join them: the University of Alberta system description" by Garrett Nicolai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the authors' participation in the CoNLL-SIGMORPHON 2017 Shared Task on Universal Morphological Reinflation, which suggests that there may be datasets related to morphological reinflation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their focus on the low-resource scenario with limited training data, specifically mentioning that they derive inflection models for five languages: English, German, Persian, Polish, and Spanish. This indicates that datasets for these languages are likely involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments sections**. The authors describe their approach to inflection generation and mention using training data limited to 100 labeled examples for each language. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets in the methods section.

In the **experiments section**, the authors refer to the training data used for their models. They mention that their models are trained on the original training set augmented with synthetic instances generated by a morphological analyzer. This implies that they are using a specific dataset for training, but I need to find the exact names and details.

I will also check the **references section** to identify any datasets that may have been cited. The authors reference the CoNLL-SIGMORPHON 2017 Shared Task, which likely includes datasets for the languages mentioned. I will look for the specific citation for this shared task.

After reviewing the references, I find the following relevant citations:

1. **CoNLL-SIGMORPHON 2017 Shared Task**:
   > Ryan Cotterell et al. *The CoNLL-SIGMORPHON 2017 shared task: Universal morphological reinflation in 52 languages*. In Proceedings of the CoNLL-SIGMORPHON 2017 Shared Task, pages 79–84, Vancouver, Canada, August 3–4, 2017. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **Morphological Reinflation Models**:
   > Garrett Nicolai et al. *Morphological reinflation via discriminative string transduction*. In Proceedings of the 14th SIGMORPHON Workshop on Computational Research in Phonetics, Phonology, and Morphology, pages 31–35, 2016. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

- **Dataset for the CoNLL-SIGMORPHON 2017 Shared Task**: This dataset includes morphological reinflation data for 52 languages, which is crucial for the experiments conducted by the authors.

- **Synthetic Training Data**: Although not a traditional dataset, the authors mention generating synthetic training data using a morphological analyzer, which is an important aspect of their methodology.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
