To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neuralizing Regular Expressions for Slot Filling" by Chengyue Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on "three popular SF datasets involving two domains and two languages." This indicates that datasets are indeed present, and I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **ATIS Dataset**: This dataset contains English queries for airline services and is widely used for evaluating slot filling models.
2. **ATIS-ZH Dataset**: This is the Chinese version of the ATIS dataset, containing similar queries but in Chinese.
3. **SNIPS Dataset**: A collection of English queries directed at voice assistants, known for its complexity and large vocabulary.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **ATIS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hemphill, C. T., Godfrey, J. J., & Doddington, G. R. (1990). *The ATIS spoken language systems pilot corpus*. In Speech and Natural Language: Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Hidden Valley, Pennsylvania, June 24-27, 1990.

- For the **ATIS-ZH Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mansour, S., & Haider, B. (2021). *ATIS seven languages LDC2021T04*. Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium.

- For the **SNIPS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Coucke, A., Saade, A., Ball, A., Bluche, T., Caulier, A., Leroy, D., Doumouro, C., Gisselbrecht, T., Caltagirone, F., Lavril, T., Primet, M., & Dureau, J. (2018). *Snips voice platform: an embedded spoken language understanding system for private-by-design voice interfaces*. CoRR, abs/1805.10190.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
