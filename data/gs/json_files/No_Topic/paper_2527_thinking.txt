To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimistic Dual Extrapolation for Coherent Non-monotone Variational Inequalities" by Chaobing Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a new method for solving variational inequalities but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments or results sections** to see if the authors provide any empirical evaluations that involve datasets. If there are tables or figures, I will pay close attention to those as they often summarize the datasets used in experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for testing the proposed method. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details about them, such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

If the authors refer to well-known datasets, I will ensure to include the original citations for those datasets, even if they are not the primary focus of the paper. For example, if they mention using a dataset like MNIST or CIFAR-10, I will provide the standard citation for those datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
