To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Bilingual Corpus Collection from Wikipedia" by Mark Unitt, Simon Tite, and Pejman Saeghe, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the creation of an automatic tool for corpus collection, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, particularly related to bilingual corpora.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors describe the need for large quantities of bilingual corpora. While they do not explicitly mention specific datasets here, it sets the context for what they are trying to achieve.

In the **methodology sections (2.1 to 2.8)**, the authors detail the steps involved in generating bilingual corpora. They mention using Wikipedia as a source for bilingual material, which indicates that the datasets they are working with are derived from Wikipedia articles. However, they do not provide specific names for these datasets.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any specific datasets are cited. The references include works related to topic modeling and comparable corpora preparation, but they do not list specific datasets by name.

Since the paper primarily discusses a methodology for generating datasets rather than presenting pre-existing datasets, I will summarize the key points regarding the datasets they create:

1. **Bilingual Corpora from Wikipedia**: The authors describe a process for collecting bilingual corpora by aligning articles from Wikipedia in different languages (e.g., English and Spanish). However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset.

2. **Generated Tuples**: The authors mention generating tuples of terms for searching Wikipedia, but again, these are not formal datasets with citations.

Given that the paper does not provide specific datasets with formal names or citations, I will note that the primary dataset discussed is the bilingual corpora created from Wikipedia articles, but it lacks a formal citation.

In conclusion, while I can summarize the methodology and the type of data being generated, I cannot provide full citations for specific datasets as they are not explicitly named in the paper. I will document this finding clearly, indicating the lack of formal dataset citations while summarizing the approach taken by the authors.
