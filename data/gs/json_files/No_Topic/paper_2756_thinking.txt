To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quality Diversity for Visual Pre-Training" by Ruchika Chavhan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a feature that supports diverse downstream tasks, which may imply the use of various datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors mention the importance of pre-training on large datasets like ImageNet. This suggests that ImageNet is a key dataset used in their work, but I need to confirm if there are additional datasets mentioned.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their experiments and the datasets used for pre-training and evaluation. They specifically mention:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset commonly used for image classification tasks. The authors indicate that they perform supervised training on ImageNet1K and contrastive training on both ImageNet1K and ImageNet100.

2. **CIFAR10 and CIFAR100**: These datasets are used for classification tasks, and the authors report performance metrics on these benchmarks.

3. **300W**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of facial landmark detection, indicating its use for regression tasks.

4. **CelebA**: Another dataset used for facial attribute detection, which is also part of their regression evaluation.

5. **LSP (Leeds Sports Pose)**: This dataset is referenced for human pose estimation tasks.

6. **MPII**: Mentioned as a dataset for human pose estimation, confirming its relevance in their experiments.

7. **Pascal VOC**: This dataset is used for object detection tasks, indicating its importance in evaluating the proposed methods.

8. **CityScapes and ADE20k**: These datasets are used for semantic segmentation tasks, further demonstrating the diversity of tasks evaluated.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics across these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- **ADE20k**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
