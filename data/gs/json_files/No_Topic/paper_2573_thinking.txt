To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Representations of Words and Documents for Discriminating Similar Languages" by Marc Franco-Salvador et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the **HispaBlogs dataset**, which is a collection of Spanish blogs from five different countries. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized, and I will need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the **DSL Corpus Collection (DSLCC v. 2.0)**. This section outlines the specifics of the dataset, including the languages it covers and the number of instances available for training and testing. The DSLCC dataset contains sentences in various languages, including Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Czech, Slovak, Argentinian Spanish, Peninsular Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, Malay, and Indonesian.

Now, I will compile the details of each dataset:

1. **HispaBlogs Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as a new collection of Spanish blogs from five different countries: Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Spain. It is used to evaluate the authors' approach to language variety identification.

2. **DSL Corpus Collection (DSLCC v. 2.0)**: This dataset is specifically designed for the Discriminating between Similar Languages (DSL) shared task. It includes sentences in multiple languages and is structured to facilitate the classification of similar languages and language varieties.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **HispaBlogs dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **DSL Corpus Collection**, the citation is:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
