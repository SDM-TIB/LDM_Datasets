To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bilingual Data Cleaning for SMT using Graph-based Random Walk" by Lei Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of bilingual data quality in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention several datasets, specifically in **Table 1**, which lists the development and testing data used in their experiments. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **NIST 2003 (dev)**: Contains 919 sentences, sourced from open test data.
2. **NIST 2005 (test)**: Contains 1,082 sentences, also from open test data.
3. **NIST 2006 (test)**: Contains 1,664 sentences, sourced from open test data.
4. **NIST 2008 (test)**: Contains 1,357 sentences, sourced from open test data.
5. **CWMT 2008 (test)**: Contains 1,006 sentences, sourced from open test data.
6. **In-house dataset 1 (test)**: Contains 1,002 sentences, sourced from web data.
7. **In-house dataset 2 (test)**: Contains 5,000 sentences, sourced from web data.
8. **In-house dataset 3 (test)**: Contains 2,999 sentences, sourced from web data.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The NIST datasets are commonly referenced in the field, and I can find their citations in standard literature. The CWMT dataset is also well-known, and I will look for its citation.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **NIST 2003**, the citation is:
  > NIST. 2003. *NIST Open Machine Translation Evaluation*. Available at: https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/open-machine-translation-evaluation.

- For **NIST 2005**, the citation is:
  > NIST. 2005. *NIST Open Machine Translation Evaluation*. Available at: https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/open-machine-translation-evaluation.

- For **NIST 2006**, the citation is:
  > NIST. 2006. *NIST Open Machine Translation Evaluation*. Available at: https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/open-machine-translation-evaluation.

- For **NIST 2008**, the citation is:
  > NIST. 2008. *NIST Open Machine Translation Evaluation*. Available at: https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/open-machine-translation-evaluation.

- For **CWMT 2008**, the citation is:
  > China Workshop on Machine Translation (CWMT). 2008. *CWMT Parallel Corpus*. Available at: http://www.cwmt.org.cn/.

- For **In-house datasets**, since they are proprietary and not publicly available, they may not have formal citations. However, I will note that they are derived from web data.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
