To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contour-Constrained Superpixels for Image and Video Processing" by Se-Ho Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed contour-constrained superpixel (CCS) algorithm and mentions experimental results, which may imply the use of datasets, but does not specify any.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors mention evaluating their algorithm on the **BSDS500 dataset** for superpixel segmentation and the **SegTrack dataset** for temporal superpixel evaluation. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then look for specific details about these datasets in the text. The authors state that they assess the CCS algorithm on the **200 test images in the BSDS500 dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for evaluating segmentation algorithms. They also mention using the **SegTrack dataset** for evaluating the temporal superpixel algorithm, which is another established dataset in the field.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **BSDS500 dataset**, the citation is:
   > D. Martin, C. Fowlkes, D. Tal, and J. Malik. *A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), volume 2, pages 416–423, 2001.

2. For the **SegTrack dataset**, the citation is:
   > D. Tsai, M. Flagg, and J. M. Rehg. *Motion coherent tracking with multi-label MRF optimization*. In Proceedings of the British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC), pages 56.1–56.11, 2010.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **BSDS500 Dataset**: A dataset containing 500 images with human-annotated segmentations, widely used for evaluating segmentation algorithms.
- **SegTrack Dataset**: A dataset designed for evaluating video segmentation algorithms, containing sequences with annotated object boundaries.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
