To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-Rank Tensors for Verbs in Compositional Distributional Semantics" by Daniel Fried, Tamara Polajnar, and Stephen Clark, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of low-rank tensors and mentions "established tasks and datasets," which indicates that datasets are likely included in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors reference previous work on transitive verb constructions and mention datasets used in their experiments. This section may provide context for the datasets.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **GS11 (Verb Disambiguation Task)**: This dataset consists of 200 sentence pairs where the two sentences in each pair have the same subject and object but differ in the verb. Each pair is ranked by human evaluators on a similarity scale.

2. **KS14 (Transitive Sentence Similarity Dataset)**: This dataset includes 72 subject-verb-object sentences arranged into 108 sentence pairs, with each pair having a gold standard semantic similarity score on a 1-7 scale.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **GS11**, the citation is:
  > Edward Grefenstette and Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh. *Experimenting with transitive verbs in a DisCoCat*. In Proceedings of the 2011 Workshop on Geometrical Models of Natural Language Semantics (GEMS 2011), Edinburgh, Scotland.

- For **KS14**, the citation is:
  > Dimitri Kartsaklis and Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh. *A study of entanglement in a categorical framework of natural language*. In Proceedings of the 11th Workshop on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2014), Kyoto, Japan.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

1. **GS11 (Verb Disambiguation Task)**: A dataset of 200 sentence pairs used to evaluate verb disambiguation based on human similarity ratings.
   - Citation: Edward Grefenstette and Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh. *Experimenting with transitive verbs in a DisCoCat*. In Proceedings of the 2011 Workshop on Geometrical Models of Natural Language Semantics (GEMS 2011), Edinburgh, Scotland.

2. **KS14 (Transitive Sentence Similarity Dataset)**: A dataset of 72 subject-verb-object sentences arranged into 108 pairs, evaluated for semantic similarity.
   - Citation: Dimitri Kartsaklis and Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh. *A study of entanglement in a categorical framework of natural language*. In Proceedings of the 11th Workshop on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2014), Kyoto, Japan.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
