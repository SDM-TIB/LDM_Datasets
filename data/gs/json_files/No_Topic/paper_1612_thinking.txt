To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proposition méthodologique pour la détection automatique de Community Manager. Étude multilingue sur un corpus relatif à la Junk Food" by Johan Ferguth et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on identifying messages from Community Managers in the context of junk food, which suggests that there may be specific datasets used for analysis.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Corpus et méthodologie)**, where the authors describe the creation of four different language corpora: English, Chinese, French, and Russian. They specifically mention that they will focus on the French corpus for detailed methodology, which indicates that this dataset is significant for their research.

In **subsection 2.1 (Stratégies d’élaboration du jeu de données et présentation du corpus)**, the authors detail the process of collecting and annotating comments from discussion forums. They mention selecting between 300 and 700 comments per language, which gives me quantitative insight into the datasets.

The paper also includes a **Table 1** that summarizes the volume of messages collected for each corpus, providing specific numbers for the French, English, and Chinese datasets. This table is crucial for understanding the scale of each dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific external dataset citations, as it primarily discusses the authors' own collected data.

The datasets I will summarize are:

1. **French Corpus**: Contains 61,205 words, with 249 non-suspect messages and 61 suspect messages.
2. **English Corpus**: Contains 32,588 words, with 251 non-suspect messages and 25 suspect messages.
3. **Chinese Corpus**: Contains 8,051 words, with 516 non-suspect messages and 184 suspect messages.

Since the authors do not cite external datasets but rather describe their own collected data, I will note that the citations for these datasets will be based on the authors' own work rather than external sources.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that captures the essential details, including the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of the datasets used in the research.
