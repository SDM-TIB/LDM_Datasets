To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Applying Unsupervised Learning To Support Vector Space Model Based Speaking Assessment" by Lei Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of Vector Space Models (VSM) in language assessment, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will move to **section 3 (Data)**, where the author describes the data used in the experiments. Here, I find that the data is collected from the **Test Of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)**, specifically from the speaking section. This is a significant dataset for the research, and I need to note its details.

In section 3, the author mentions that the data contains speech responses for a total of **24 test items**. Each item includes stimulus material and questions presented to test-takers, followed by their spoken responses. The responses were scored by human raters using a 4-point holistic scoring scale. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the TOEFL dataset in the **References section**. However, since the TOEFL is a well-known standardized test, it may not have a specific citation like a typical dataset. Instead, I will note it as follows:

- **TOEFL Speaking Responses**: This dataset consists of speech responses collected from the TOEFL speaking test, which evaluates students' English-speaking skills. The dataset includes responses for 24 test items, scored by human raters.

Next, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In the **experiments section**, the author discusses various methods and their evaluations but does not introduce any new datasets. The focus remains on the TOEFL dataset.

Since the primary dataset used in this research is the TOEFL speaking responses, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset entry, ensuring that the citation is clear and accurate for future reference.
