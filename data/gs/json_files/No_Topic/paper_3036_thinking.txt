To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empirical Analysis of Noising Scheme based Synthetic Data Generation for Automatic Post-editing" by Hyeonseok Moon et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study addresses the lack of official datasets for many language pairs in the context of Automatic Post-editing (APE). This suggests that the authors may have created or utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges in generating APE data and mention the use of parallel corpora. This hints at the potential datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

In **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments: the **Korean-English (Ko-En) parallel corpus** distributed by AIHub. They describe this corpus as consisting of 1.6 million sentence pairs from various domains, which they used to construct APE training and test data.

I will also note the specific details provided about the dataset, such as the number of sentence pairs extracted for training and testing (18,000 for training and 2,000 for testing) and the domains included (colloquial, news, dialogue, cultural, ordinance, and official documents).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The citation for the AIHub dataset is:
> Park, C., Shim, M., Eo, S., Lee, S., Seo, J., Moon, H., and Lim, H. (2021). Empirical analysis of Korean public AI Hub parallel corpora and in-depth analysis using LIWC. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.15023.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure to include the full citation in my final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that highlights the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
