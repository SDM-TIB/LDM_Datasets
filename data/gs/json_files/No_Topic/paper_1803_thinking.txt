To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "A Graphical Model Approach for Matching Partial Signatures" by Xianzhi Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the method is evaluated on three datasets derived from the DS-I Tobacco signature dataset and the DS-II UMD dataset. This indicates that datasets are indeed present and need to be identified.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **DS-I Tobacco Signature Dataset**: This dataset contains 189 relatively clean and high-quality signatures from 63 authors, with three signatures per author. All signatures are full signatures.

2. **DS-II UMD Signature Dataset**: This dataset contains 26,661 signatures from 887 authors. It includes a mixture of full signatures and partial signatures, making it more challenging due to various degradations.

Additionally, the authors create two partial signature datasets based on the above datasets:

3. **DS-I Partial Dataset**: This dataset is manually created by clipping out the first names from the full signatures in the DS-I Tobacco dataset.

4. **DS-II Partial Dataset**: This dataset consists of 495 full signatures for training and 1,732 signatures for testing, which include both partial and full signatures.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- For the **DS-I Tobacco Signature Dataset**, the citation is:
  > "Tobacco Signature Dataset." Available at: lamp.cfar.umd.edu.

- For the **DS-II UMD Signature Dataset**, the citation is:
  > "UMD Signature Dataset." Available at: lamp.cfar.umd.edu.

Since the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets beyond their availability, I will note that they are both accessible from the same source.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
