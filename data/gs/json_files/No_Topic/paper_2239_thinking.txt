To extract datasets from the research paper titled "e-CARE: a New Dataset for Exploring Explainable Causal Reasoning," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of a human-annotated explainable causal reasoning dataset called **e-CARE**, which is a strong indication that this is the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section more closely. Here, the authors describe the e-CARE dataset as containing over 20,000 causal reasoning questions along with natural language explanations. This confirms that e-CARE is indeed a significant dataset in this research.

In the **related work section**, the authors compare e-CARE with other existing datasets in the field of commonsense causal reasoning. They mention several datasets, including **CausalNet**, **CausalBank**, **COPA**, and others, but the focus remains on e-CARE as a new contribution.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors provide any additional details about the e-CARE dataset, such as its construction, statistics, and unique features. The paper states that e-CARE is the largest human-annotated commonsense causal reasoning dataset, which further emphasizes its importance.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the e-CARE dataset as mentioned in the paper. The authors do not provide a separate citation for e-CARE in the references section, but they do reference their own work throughout the paper. Therefore, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the e-CARE dataset is:
> Anonymous. *e-CARE: a New Dataset for Exploring Explainable Causal Reasoning*. Anonymous ACL submission.

In summary, the primary dataset extracted from this paper is the **e-CARE dataset**, which is a significant contribution to the field of causal reasoning in NLP. I will ensure to document this dataset along with its citation for future reference.
