To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Rare Category Classifiers on a Tight Labeling Budget" by Ravi Teja Mullapudi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of training models for rare categories and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation. The introduction elaborates on the need for labeled data and mentions the use of datasets like iNaturalist and Places for experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the experiments section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their approach using two datasets: 

1. **iNaturalist Dataset**: This dataset is used for fine-grained species recognition and is mentioned as having 50 categories with a very low percentage of positive instances per category.

2. **Places Dataset**: This dataset is used for scene classification and consists of 20 categories, also with a low percentage of positive instances.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For the **iNaturalist Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Grant Van Horn, Oisin Mac Aodha, Yang Song, Yin Cui, Chen Sun, Alex Shepard, Hartwig Adam, Pietro Perona, and Serge Belongie. *The iNaturalist Species Classification and Detection Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 8769â€“8778, 2018.

- For the **Places Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bolei Zhou, Agata Lapedriza, Aditya Khosla, Aude Oliva, and Antonio Torralba. *Places: A 10 Million Image Database for Scene Recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
