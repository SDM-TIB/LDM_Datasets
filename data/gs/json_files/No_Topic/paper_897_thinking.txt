To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hardware Compliant Approximate Image Codes" by Da Kuang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted empirical analyses on multiple standard datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **Caltech-101**, **Caltech-256**, **Pascal VOC 2007**, and **MIT Scenes** datasets. I will note down the details provided about each dataset, including their purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

- For **Caltech-101**, the citation is:
  > L. Fei-Fei, R. Fergus, and P. Perona. *Learning generative visual models from few training examples: An incremental bayesian approach tested on 101 object categories*. Comput. Vis. Image Underst., 106(1):59–70, 2007.

- For **Caltech-256**, the citation is:
  > G. Grifﬁn, A. Holub, and P. Perona. *Caltech-256 object category dataset*. 2007.

- For **Pascal VOC 2007**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The Pascal visual object classes (VOC) challenge*. Int. J. Comput. Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

- For **MIT Scenes**, the citation is:
  > A. Quattoni and A. Torralba. *Recognizing indoor scenes*. In Proc. of the 2009 IEEE Conf. on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR ’09, pages 413–420, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
