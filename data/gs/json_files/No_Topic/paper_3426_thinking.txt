To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How far can we get with one GPU in 100 hours? CoAStaL at MultiIndicMT Shared Task" by Rahul Aralikatte et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions benchmarking on the **PMI corpus**, which indicates that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **Data section** (Section 2), where the authors describe the **MultiIndicMT data**. This section provides a detailed overview of the datasets used, including their sources and characteristics. The authors mention that the MultiIndicMT data is a combination of parallel corpora from various sources, specifically for translations from 10 Indic languages to English.

I will list the datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **PMI corpus**: This is a collection of parallel corpora of languages of India, containing about 11 million translation pairs. The development and test splits contain 1000 and 2390 11-way parallel sentences, respectively.

2. **JW300**: A wide-coverage parallel corpus for low-resource languages, referenced in the paper.

3. **TED**: A dataset used for translations, mentioned in the context of the sources of MultiIndicMT data.

4. **Bible-uedin**: A parallel corpus that includes translations of the Bible in multiple languages.

5. **OpenSubtitles**: A dataset containing subtitles from movies and TV shows, used for translation tasks.

6. **WikiMatrix**: A dataset that consists of parallel sentences mined from Wikipedia.

7. **Wiki Titles**: A dataset that includes titles from Wikipedia articles.

8. **ALT**: A dataset related to Asian languages.

9. **IITB 3.0**: A parallel corpus for English-Hindi translations.

10. **NLPC**: A dataset mentioned in the context of the MultiIndicMT data sources.

11. **UFAL EnTam**: A dataset for English-Tamil translations.

12. **Uka Tarsadia**: Another dataset mentioned in the paper.

13. **MTEnglish2Odia**: A parallel corpus for English-Odia translations.

14. **OdiEnCorp 2.0**: A dataset for Odia-English translations.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
