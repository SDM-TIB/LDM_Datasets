To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Concept Wikiﬁcation for COVID-19" by Panagiotis Lymperopoulos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a COVID-19 concept wikiﬁcation dataset, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Building a Dataset for COVID-19 Concept Wikiﬁcation)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the dataset. Here, the authors describe their process for curating a large labeled dataset for training concept wikiﬁers, which includes identifying 7,238 concepts related to COVID-19 and harvesting labeled mentions from Wikipedia.

In **subsection 3.1**, the authors explain their methodology for finding relevant concepts, which involves starting from the Wikipedia page for COVID-19 and expanding outward through intra-Wikipedia links. This process results in a total of 11,795 concepts, but they filter this down to 7,238 relevant concepts for their dataset.

In **subsection 3.2**, they detail how they harvested labeled mentions for these concepts, indicating that the dataset includes labeled instances where each mention of a concept is linked to its corresponding Wikipedia title. They provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of sentences and concepts.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself, but they mention that the dataset, code, and pre-trained model are available at a GitHub repository. Therefore, I will cite the GitHub link as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Lymperopoulos, P., Qiu, H., & Min, B. (2020). *Concept Wikiﬁcation for COVID-19*. Available at: https://github.com/panlybero/Covid19_wikification

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **COVID-19 Concept Wikiﬁcation Dataset**: A large labeled dataset containing 7,238 concepts related to COVID-19, harvested from Wikipedia, with mentions labeled with their corresponding Wikipedia titles.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
