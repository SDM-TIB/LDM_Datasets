To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Syntax and Pragmatics of Conversation: A Case of Bangla" by D S Sharma, R Sangal, and A K Singh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on conversational analysis, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Indeclinable to in Bengali)** and **section 3 (Bengali particle to in the light of Pragmatics)**, as these sections may contain examples or data that could be considered datasets. However, it appears that the paper primarily discusses theoretical concepts and linguistic analysis rather than presenting empirical datasets.

I will also check the **discussion and conclusion sections** to see if the authors reference any datasets used in their analysis or any data collection methods. If they mention any specific datasets or corpora used for their linguistic analysis, I will note them down.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will look at the **References section** to find any citations related to datasets or corpora that the authors might have used. This is crucial because even if the datasets are not explicitly mentioned in the text, they may be referenced in the citations.

If I find any datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset, as this is very important. For instance, if the authors refer to a specific corpus of conversational data, I will look for the original source of that corpus in the references.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including its name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for presenting this information.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for any mentions of datasets.
2. Review sections discussing linguistic analysis for potential datasets or data sources.
3. Check the discussion and conclusion for any references to data collection.
4. Consult the references for full citations of any datasets mentioned.
5. Compile the dataset information with full citations for each identified dataset.
