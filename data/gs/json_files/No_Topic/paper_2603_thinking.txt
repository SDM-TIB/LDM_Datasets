To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Native Language Identification using Phonetic Algorithms" by Charese Smiley and Sandra KÃ¼bler, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the IUCL system's participation in the NLI Shared Task 2017, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction provides context about Native Language Identification (NLI) and hints at the datasets used for training and testing.

Next, I will focus on the **Data section** (section 3), where the authors describe the datasets used for the NLI Shared Task. Here, they mention that the data consists of essays from 11 different native languages (L1s) and provide specific details about the training and development datasets.

The paper states that the dataset includes:
- **TOEFL11 corpus**: This dataset consists of essays from 11 L1s: Arabic (ARA), Chinese (CHI), French (FRE), German (GER), Hindi (HIN), Italian (ITA), Japanese (JPN), Korean (KOR), Spanish (SPA), Telugu (TEL), and Turkish (TUR). There are 11,000 training essays (1,000 for each L1) and 1,100 development essays (100 for each L1).

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the TOEFL11 corpus, which is crucial for proper attribution. The citation for the TOEFL11 corpus is:
> Tetreault, J., Blanchard, D., & Cahill, A. (2013). A Report on the First Native Language Identification Shared Task. In Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop on Building Educational Applications Using NLP (pp. 1-11). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: TOEFL11 corpus
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of essays from 11 different native languages, with a total of 11,000 training essays and 1,100 development essays.
   - **Full Citation**: Tetreault, J., Blanchard, D., & Cahill, A. (2013). A Report on the First Native Language Identification Shared Task. In Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop on Building Educational Applications Using NLP (pp. 1-11). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset extracted from the paper.
