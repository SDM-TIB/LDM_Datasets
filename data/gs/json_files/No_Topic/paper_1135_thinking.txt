To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Google Books N-gram Corpus used as a Grammar Checker" by Rogelio Nazar and Irene Renau, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a "large n-gram corpus (Google Books)" for deriving lexical transition probabilities, indicating that this corpus is a key dataset in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **results** sections. In the introduction, the authors refer to the Google Books N-gram Corpus compiled by Michel et al. (2011), which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments. 

In the **methodology** section, the authors describe how they utilize the Google Books N-gram Corpus for various grammar-checking tasks. They mention that the corpus records the frequency distribution of n-grams from 1500 onwards, with a focus on data starting from 1970. This detailed description confirms that the Google Books N-gram Corpus is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **results** section to see if any additional datasets are referenced. The authors mention using a corpus of real errors made by second language learners (CEDEL2 corpus) for evaluating their algorithm. This indicates that there is another dataset involved in their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **Google Books N-gram Corpus**:
   - Citation: Michel, J.-B., Shen, Y. K., Presser Aiden, A., Veres, A., Gray, M. K., The Google Books Team, Pickett, J. P., Hoiberg, D., Clancy, D., Norvig, P., Orwant, J., Pinker, S., Nowak, M. A., & Lieberman Aiden, E. (2011). Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books. *Science*, 331(6014), 176–182.

2. **CEDEL2 Corpus**:
   - Citation: Lozano, C. (2009). CEDEL2: Corpus Escrito del Español L2. In Bretones Callejas, C. M. et al. (Eds.), *Applied Linguistics Now: Understanding Language and Mind* (pp. 197–212). Almería: Universidad de Almería.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
