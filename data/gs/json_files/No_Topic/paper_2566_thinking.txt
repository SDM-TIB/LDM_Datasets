To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-modal Visualization and Search for Text and Prosody Annotations" by Markus Gärtner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces ICARUS for intonation, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, particularly related to prosodic features and annotations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the capabilities of ICARUS and its previous modules. They mention that ICARUS can handle various types of data, including speech corpora, which indicates that there might be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

In **section 5 (Search)**, the authors mention using the **DIRNDL corpus** for example data in their search functionalities. This is a clear indication that this corpus is one of the datasets utilized in their research.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DIRNDL corpus. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Kerstin Eckart, Arndt Riester, and Katrin Schweitzer. *A Discourse Information Radio News Database for Linguistic Analysis*. In Christian Chiarcos, Sebastian Nordhoff, and Sebastian Hellmann, editors, Linked Data in Linguistics, pages 65–75. Springer, Heidelberg, 2012.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus on documenting the DIRNDL corpus as the primary dataset used in the research.

Now, I will compile the information about the DIRNDL corpus into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and concise entry for the dataset extracted from the paper.
