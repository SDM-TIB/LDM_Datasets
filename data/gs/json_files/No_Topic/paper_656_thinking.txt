To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Tweet Retrieval with Compact Binary Codes" by Weiwei Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their model on a tweet dataset, which indicates that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of tweet similarity computations and mention the collection of a tweet dataset consisting of 1.35 million tweets over three months. This is a significant dataset, and I need to gather more details about it.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide further information about the dataset. They describe how they crawled English tweets using the Twitter API, cleaned the data, and created groundtruth labels based on hashtags. They also specify that the dataset contains 1,350,159 tweets, 15 million word tokens, 30,608 unique words, and 3,214 unique hashtags. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance and size.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is collected from Twitter and does not have a formal citation like a published dataset, I will note that the dataset is based on tweets collected from the Twitter API.

The citation for the dataset can be summarized as follows:
> Guo, W., Liu, W., & Diab, M. (2014). Fast Tweet Retrieval with Compact Binary Codes. In *Proceedings of COLING 2014, the 25th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers* (pp. 486â€“496). Dublin, Ireland.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset's name, description, and citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
