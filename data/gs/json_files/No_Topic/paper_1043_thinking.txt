To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adapting the PULS Event Extraction Framework to Analyze Russian Text" by Lidia Pivovarova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's objectives and may hint at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the PULS framework and its application to Russian-language text. They mention two scenarios: epidemic surveillance and cross-border security. I will look for any specific datasets related to these scenarios.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. The authors may provide information about the sources of data, the size of the datasets, and how they were utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **evaluation section** to see if the authors mention any datasets used for testing the performance of their system. This section often contains valuable information about the datasets, including their characteristics and relevance to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset related to epidemic surveillance, I will look for the original source of that dataset and provide a complete citation. Similarly, for any datasets related to cross-border security, I will ensure to find and document their citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their descriptions and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and attributed.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
