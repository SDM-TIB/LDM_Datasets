To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single Image Camera Calibration with Lenticular Arrays for Augmented Reality" by Ian Schillebeeckx and Robert Pless, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses a calibration object based on lenticular arrays but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. I will look for any references to datasets used for validation or testing the proposed methods. In this case, the authors discuss the performance of their calibration object but do not mention any specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if the authors reference any datasets used in previous studies that are relevant to their work. However, it appears that the focus is more on the methodology rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of others. The references primarily consist of previous research papers and methodologies related to camera calibration and augmented reality, but they do not provide specific datasets.

Given that no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract for this particular research. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are present in the text.

In summary, I will document my findings, noting that while the paper presents a novel calibration method, it does not utilize or reference any specific datasets for evaluation or experimentation.
