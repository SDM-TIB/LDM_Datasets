To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can the Transformer Learn Nested Recursion with Symbol Masking?" by Jean-Philippe Bernardy, Adam Ek, and Vladislav Maraev, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but the datasets section will likely contain the most relevant information.

In **section 2 (Data Sets)**, the authors define a language D, which is generated by context-free rules involving nested parentheses. They describe the characteristics of the strings generated from this language, but they do not mention any external datasets. Instead, they create their own dataset based on the defined language rules.

Next, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used for training or testing the models in the **experiments section**. The authors discuss their experiments in sections 4.1 and 4.2, focusing on generalization to longer distances and deeper nesting. However, they do not reference any pre-existing datasets; rather, they describe the generation of strings based on their defined rules.

Since the paper does not cite any external datasets, I will note that the authors generated their own dataset, referred to as D, and its variations D[MaxDist = d] and D[MaxDepth = d]. I will also summarize the characteristics of these datasets as described in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the generated datasets:

1. **Dataset D**: This dataset consists of strings generated by context-free rules involving matching parentheses. The authors specify that they use 5 types of parentheses pairs ((), [], {}, <>, «»).

2. **Dataset D[MaxDist = d]**: A variation of dataset D where elements are discarded if the distance between opening and closing parentheses exceeds a specified maximum distance d.

3. **Dataset D[MaxDepth = d]**: Another variation of dataset D where strings are generated to ensure that the maximum nesting depth does not exceed a specified depth d.

Since these datasets are generated by the authors and not sourced from external references, I will note that there are no formal citations for them. However, I will summarize the characteristics of each dataset as described in the paper.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of the datasets and their characteristics for any further processing or documentation.
