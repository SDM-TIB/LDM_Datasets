To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Improving Event Temporal Relation Classification via Auxiliary Label-Aware Contrastive Learning" by Tiesen Sun and Lishuang Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on **TB-Dense** and **MATRES** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 6 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In **subsection 6.1 (Dataset)**, they describe the two datasets:

1. **TB-Dense**: This dataset is densely annotated for event temporal relation classification and is based on TimeBank. It includes 10097 documents and 2643 triplets for training, 204 documents and 51 triplets for validation, and 22 documents and 5 triplets for testing. The dataset annotates six temporal relations: AFTER, BEFORE, INCLUDE, IS INCLUDED, VAGUE, and SIMULTANEOUS.

2. **MATRES**: This dataset is refined from TimeBank and TempEval, containing 275 documents. It includes 4032 documents and 629 triplets for training, 22 documents and 5 triplets for validation, and 20 documents and 9 triplets for testing. MATRES annotates four temporal relations: BEFORE, AFTER, EQUAL, and VAGUE.

To ensure accuracy, I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **TB-Dense**, the citation is:
  > Taylor Cassidy, Bill McDowell, Nathanael Chambers, and Steven Bethard. *An annotation framework for dense event ordering*. In ACL (Volume 2: Short Papers), pages 501–506, 2014.

- For **MATRES**, the citation is:
  > Qiang Ning, Hao Wu, and Dan Roth. *A multi-axis annotation scheme for event temporal relations*. In ACL (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1318–1328, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
