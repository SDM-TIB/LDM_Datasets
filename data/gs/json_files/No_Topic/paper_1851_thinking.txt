To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PAIGE: PAirwise Image Geometry Encoding for Improved Efficiency in Structure-from-Motion" by Johannes L. Schönberger et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the evolution of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and mention the need for efficient image matching techniques. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets here.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors describe their experiments. They mention using several datasets for evaluating their proposed method. Specifically, in **Table 1**, they list the datasets used for their experiments, which include:

1. **London Eye**: A crowd-sourced image collection containing images of the London Eye landmark.
2. **San Marco**: Another crowd-sourced dataset featuring images of the San Marco area.
3. **Tate Modern**: This dataset consists of images taken around the Tate Modern museum.
4. **Time Square**: A collection of images from the Time Square area.
5. **Trafalgar**: Images collected from the Trafalgar Square area.
6. **Rome**: A well-studied dataset consisting of images from various landmarks in Rome.

The paper also indicates that these datasets contain a diverse set of viewpoints and that the first five datasets are contaminated with irrelevant images, while the Rome dataset consists solely of relevant images.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors reference several works that may include the datasets or methodologies used to create them. 

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations based on the references provided in the paper:

- For the **London Eye**, **San Marco**, **Tate Modern**, **Time Square**, and **Trafalgar** datasets, the citation is:
  > S. Agarwal, Y. Furukawa, N. Snavely, I. Simon, B. Curless, S. M. Seitz, and R. Szeliski. *Building Rome in a Day*. Commun. ACM, 54(10):105–112, 2011.

- For the **Rome dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Li, N. Snavely, and D. P. Huttenlocher. *Location Recognition Using Prioritized Feature Matching*. In Proc. ECCV, pages 791–804, 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format them according to the required structure for downstream processing.
