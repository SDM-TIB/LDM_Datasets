To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Early Rumour Detection" by Kaimin Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on Twitter and Weibo, which suggests that these platforms may be the sources of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Data Set)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that they used two datasets: **WEIBO** and **TWITTER**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide statistics for both datasets, including the number of users, posts, events, and rumors. This information is crucial for describing the datasets comprehensively.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The authors reference the datasets as follows:

1. **WEIBO Dataset**: Developed by Ma et al. (2016). The citation is:
   > Jing Ma, Wei Gao, Prasenjit Mitra, Sejeong Kwon, Bernard J Jansen, Kam-Fai Wong, and Meeyoung Cha. *Detecting rumors from microblogs with recurrent neural networks*. In IJCAI, pages 3818â€“3824, 2016.

2. **TWITTER Dataset**: Developed by Zubiaga et al. (2016). The citation is:
   > Arkaitz Zubiaga, Maria Liakata, and Rob Procter. *Learning reporting dynamics during breaking news for rumour detection in social media*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.07363, 2016.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets:

- **WEIBO Dataset**: Contains a large number of posts and events related to rumors, specifically designed for rumour detection tasks.
- **TWITTER Dataset**: Similar to the WEIBO dataset, it includes posts and events for analyzing rumor dynamics on Twitter.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its respective citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
