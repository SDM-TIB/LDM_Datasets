To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adapting Predicate Frames for Urdu PropBanking" by Riyaz Ahmad Bhat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions efforts to adapt frames for Urdu PropBanking, which suggests that there may be datasets related to Urdu vocabulary and PropBanking.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (A multi-layered, multi-representational treebank)**, where the authors discuss the Hindi-Urdu treebanking project. This section may contain information about the datasets used for creating the treebanks, including any specific datasets for Hindi and Urdu.

In **section 3 (Identifying the source of Urdu Vocabulary)**, the authors mention using the **Online Urdu Dictionary (OUD)** to prepare training and testing data marked with etymological information. This indicates that the OUD is a dataset used in their experiments.

I will also look into **section 4 (Adapting Frames from Arabic and Hindi PropBanks)**, where the authors discuss the adaptation of predicate frames from existing PropBanks. They reference the **Hindi PropBank** and **Arabic PropBank**, which are datasets that will need to be cited.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution.

The datasets I have identified so far include:

1. **Online Urdu Dictionary (OUD)**: This dataset provides etymological information for Urdu words and is used for classification tasks in the paper.
   - Citation: 
     > Online Urdu Dictionary. Available at: http://182.180.102.251:8081/oud/default.aspx

2. **Hindi PropBank**: This dataset is used for adapting frames for Urdu PropBanking.
   - Citation:
     > Palmer, M., Babko-Malaya, O., Bies, A., Diab, M. T., Maamouri, M., Mansouri, A., & Zaghouani, W. (2008). A pilot Arabic PropBank. In LREC.

3. **Arabic PropBank**: Similar to the Hindi PropBank, this dataset is referenced for adapting frames for Urdu.
   - Citation:
     > Palmer, M., Babko-Malaya, O., Bies, A., Diab, M. T., Maamouri, M., Mansouri, A., & Zaghouani, W. (2008). A pilot Arabic PropBank. In LREC.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured the relevant information from the paper. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets for further processing or review.
