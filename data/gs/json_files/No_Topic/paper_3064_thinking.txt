To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Offensive language detection for Dravidian Code-mixed YouTube comments" by Judith Jeyafreeda Andrew, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the task of offensive language detection in YouTube comments, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction provides context about the languages and the nature of the data, indicating that the datasets are likely related to YouTube comments in Tamil, Malayalam, and Kannada.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the author explicitly describes the datasets used for the study. Here, I will look for specific mentions of the datasets, including their sizes and the sources from which they were obtained. The paper states that the data for the shared task is a collection of YouTube comments in code-mixed languages, specifically:

1. **Tamil Code-mixed YouTube Comments**: This dataset has 35,139 instances in the train set, 4,388 instances in the dev set, and 4,392 instances in the test set. The source is cited as (Chakravarthi et al., 2020b).

2. **Malayalam Code-mixed YouTube Comments**: This dataset contains 16,010 instances in the train set, 1,999 instances in the dev set, and 2,001 instances in the test set. The source is cited as (Chakravarthi et al., 2020a).

3. **Kannada Code-mixed YouTube Comments**: This dataset has 6,216 instances in the train set, 776 instances in the dev set, and 778 instances in the test set. The source is cited as (Hande et al., 2020).

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Tamil Code-mixed YouTube Comments**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
