To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Near-Optimal Smoothing of Structured Conditional Probability Matrices" by Moein Falahatgar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will pay particular attention to the introduction and experiments sections for detailed descriptions of datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their work, particularly in relation to language modeling and probability estimation. They mention the use of bigram models, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 7 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their empirical study. They mention several datasets used for testing their algorithms, specifically:

1. **Tartuffe**: A French text dataset with a training and test size of 9.3k words and a vocabulary size of 2.8k words.
2. **Genesis**: An English version dataset with a training and test size of 19k words and a vocabulary size of 4.4k words.
3. **Brown**: A shortened version of the Brown corpus with a training and test size of 20k words and a vocabulary size of 10.5k words.

These datasets are crucial for understanding the performance of the proposed algorithms, and their details are clearly outlined in the experiments section.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used in natural language processing and may not have formal citations in the same way as research papers, I will note their sources as follows:

- **Tartuffe**: This dataset is a well-known literary text and can be referenced as:
  > MoliÃ¨re. *Tartuffe*. Available at: [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2029).

- **Genesis**: This dataset is also widely available and can be referenced as:
  > The Bible. *Genesis*. Available at: [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1).

- **Brown Corpus**: This dataset is a classic linguistic resource and can be referenced as:
  > Francis, W. N., & Kucera, H. *Brown Corpus of Standard American English*. Available at: [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that captures the essential details, including the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.
