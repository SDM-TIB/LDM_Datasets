To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature Space Perturbations Yield More Transferable Adversarial Examples" by Nathan Inkawhich et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a targeted adversarial attack and the evaluation of its effectiveness, which suggests that datasets are involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 5), where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they specifically mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** as their primary testing dataset. They also reference the **ImageNet dataset** for additional experiments. 

In the **CIFAR-10 section**, the authors explain that it is a non-trivial dataset where state-of-the-art models can achieve low error rates, making it suitable for their adversarial attack experiments. They mention that they keep a library of examples from each class, indicating the dataset's structure and usage.

For the **ImageNet dataset**, they describe using pretrained models and conducting experiments on a subset of the test set. This indicates that they are leveraging the dataset for evaluating the transferability of their adversarial attacks.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. 2010.

- For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
