To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Neural sentence generation from formal semantics" by Kana Manome et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in generating sentences from logical representations and mention the need for data annotated with logical formulas. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset they created. They mention that they constructed a dataset annotated with logical formulas from the **SNLI corpus**. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including its size and how it was split into training, development, and test sets.

The dataset details are as follows:
- **SNLI corpus**: The authors used 50,000 hypothesis sentences from the training portion of the SNLI corpus, which consists of 570,000 English sentence pairs labeled with entailment relations. They split the dataset into 42,000 for training, 4,000 for development, and 4,000 for testing.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the SNLI corpus in the **References section**. The citation is:
> Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 632â€“642.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the SNLI corpus.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the SNLI corpus, ensuring it is ready for any further processing or review.
