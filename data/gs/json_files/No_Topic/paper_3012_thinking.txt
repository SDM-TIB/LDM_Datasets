To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Partial Occlusion Handling for Visual Tracking via Robust Part Matching" by Tianzhu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on "challenging benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they state that they evaluate tracking performance on "16 publicly available video sequences." This indicates that there are specific datasets being used, but I need to identify them by name.

I will look for any detailed descriptions of these datasets within the **experiments section** or any other relevant sections. The authors mention that the datasets contain various scenarios with challenges such as occlusion, illumination changes, and abrupt motion. However, they do not provide specific names or citations for these datasets in the text.

Since the datasets are not explicitly named in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works correspond to the datasets used. I will look for any references that might describe the datasets or benchmarks used in visual tracking.

After reviewing the references, I find that the authors have cited several papers related to visual tracking, but they do not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves. This means I will need to rely on general knowledge of commonly used datasets in visual tracking to provide context.

Based on my knowledge, I will assume that the datasets used might include well-known benchmarks such as:

1. **OTB (Object Tracking Benchmark)**: A widely used dataset for evaluating tracking algorithms, which includes various sequences with different challenges.
2. **VOT (Visual Object Tracking)**: Another popular benchmark that provides a set of sequences specifically designed for tracking evaluation.

However, since the paper does not explicitly name these datasets, I will note that the exact datasets used in the experiments are not specified in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered, including the general knowledge of potential datasets, and prepare to document them with appropriate citations if available. If specific citations for the datasets are not provided in the paper, I will indicate that in my final output.

In summary, I will document the datasets as follows:

- **Datasets**: Mentioned as "16 publicly available video sequences" but not explicitly named in the paper.
- **Potential Datasets**: OTB (Object Tracking Benchmark) and VOT (Visual Object Tracking) as commonly used benchmarks in the field.

Since the paper does not provide full citations for these datasets, I will note that the exact references are not available in the text.
