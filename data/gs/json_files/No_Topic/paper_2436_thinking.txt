To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Optimization for Heterogeneous Networks" by Tian Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses federated learning and mentions empirical evaluations, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** (Section 5). Here, the authors describe their empirical evaluations and mention using diverse tasks, models, and both synthetic and real-world datasets. They specifically list datasets such as **partitioned MNIST**, **Federated Extended MNIST (FEMNIST)**, **FMNIST***, **Sentiment140**, and **The Complete Works of William Shakespeare**.

I will then check the **appendices** for detailed descriptions of these datasets, as they often contain additional information about the datasets used in experiments. In Appendix B.1, the authors provide detailed statistics and descriptions for each dataset:

1. **Partitioned MNIST**: A dataset for image classification of handwritten digits, distributed among 1000 devices, where each device has samples of only 2 digits.

2. **Federated Extended MNIST (FEMNIST)**: An extension of the EMNIST dataset for handwritten letters, where each device corresponds to a writer.

3. **FMNIST**: A dataset similar to MNIST but containing fashion items instead of digits.

4. **Sentiment140**: A dataset for sentiment analysis of tweets, where each Twitter account corresponds to a device.

5. **The Complete Works of William Shakespeare**: A dataset used for next character prediction, where each speaking role in a play represents a different device.

Next, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations.
