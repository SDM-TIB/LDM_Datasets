To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multichannel LSTM-CNN for Telugu Technical Domain Identification" by Sunil Gundapu and Radhika Mamidi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their methodology on a dataset provided by the organizers of the TechDOfication 2020 shared task, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the dataset consists of:

- **68865 text documents for training**
- **5920 text documents for validation**
- **2611 text documents for testing**

The authors also provide a breakdown of the training and validation data across different domain categories, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The dataset is associated with the TechDOfication 2020 shared task, so I will look for the relevant citation that describes this task. 

The citation for the dataset is:
> TechDOfication 2020 Shared Task. *Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Natural Language Processing*, pages 11â€“15, Patna, India, December 18 - 21, 2020. NLP Association of India (NLPAI).

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **TechDOfication 2020 Dataset**: This dataset consists of a total of 68865 text documents for training, 5920 for validation, and 2611 for testing, categorized into six domain labels: Bio-Chemistry, Communication Technology, Computer Science, Management, Physics, and Other.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset details along with the full citation, ensuring that all necessary information is included for future reference or processing.
