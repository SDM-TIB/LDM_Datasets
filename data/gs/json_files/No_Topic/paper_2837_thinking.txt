To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dense Monocular Depth Estimation in Complex Dynamic Scenes" by RenÂ´e Ranftl et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the approach is evaluated on the **Sintel and KITTI datasets**, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will check the **evaluation section** where the authors discuss their results. They explicitly state that they evaluate their approach on the **MPI Sintel dataset** and the **KITTI dataset**. This confirms that both datasets are used for quantitative and qualitative evaluation of their method.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of each dataset from the text. 

1. **MPI Sintel Dataset**: The authors describe it as consisting of complex computer graphics sequences, constructed for thorough evaluation of optical flow techniques. They mention that it provides precise ground truth, which is beneficial for their evaluation.

2. **KITTI Dataset**: The authors refer to the KITTI odometry set, which provides sparse ground-truth depth measurements acquired by a LiDAR scanner. This dataset is used for quantitative evaluation, and the authors compare their results against other methods using this dataset.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MPI Sintel dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. J. Butler, J. Wulff, G. B. Stanley, and M. J. Black. *A naturalistic open source movie for optical flow evaluation*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2012.

- For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, C. Stiller, and R. Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR), 32(11), 2013.

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will be done in a structured format suitable for further processing or review.
