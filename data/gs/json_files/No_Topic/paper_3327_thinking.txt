To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Impact of Typicality for Informative Representative Selection" by Jawadul H. Bappy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is demonstrated through rigorous experimentation on five datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors state that they demonstrate their results on two scenarios: multi-task classification (scene-object and activity-object) and single-task classification (scene or object recognition). They also mention using specific datasets for these tasks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used:

1. **MSRC Dataset**: This dataset is used for joint scene-object classification and is noted for providing a rich source of contextual information.
2. **MIT-67 Dataset**: Another dataset used for joint scene-object classification, which includes 67 scene categories and 50 object categories.
3. **CAD-120 Dataset**: This dataset is used to evaluate results on joint activity-objects classification.
4. **Scene-15 Dataset**: This dataset is used for scene classification.
5. **VOC2010 Dataset**: This dataset is used for object recognition.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MSRC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Alberti, J. Folkesson, and P. Jensfelt. *Relational approaches for joint object classification and scene similarity measurement in indoor environments*. In AAAI 2014 Spring Symposia: Qualitative Representations for Robots, 2014.

- For **MIT-67 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Quattoni and A. Torralba. *Recognizing indoor scenes*. In CVPR, 2009.

- For **CAD-120 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. S. Koppula, R. Gupta, and A. Saxena. *Learning human activities and object affordances from rgb-d videos*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 2013.

- For **Scene-15 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Lazebnik, C. Schmid, and J. Ponce. *Beyond bags of features: Spatial pyramid matching for recognizing natural scene categories*. In CVPR, 2006.

- For **VOC2010 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The pascal visual object classes (voc) challenge*. IJCV, 2010.

With these citations in hand, I will now prepare to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
