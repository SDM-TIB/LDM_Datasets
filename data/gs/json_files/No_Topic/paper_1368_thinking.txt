To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LEXFIT: Lexical Fine-Tuning of Pretrained Language Models" by Ivan Vulic et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method over "four established, structurally different lexical-level tasks in 8 languages," which suggests that there are datasets associated with these tasks.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experimental setup** section, particularly in the subsections that detail the evaluation tasks. The authors describe four tasks: Lexical Semantic Similarity (LSIM), Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI), Lexical Relation Prediction (RELP), and Lexical Simplification (LexSIMP). Each of these tasks likely has associated datasets.

In the **evaluation tasks** subsection, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for each task:

1. **Lexical Semantic Similarity (LSIM)**: The authors mention using the **Multi-SimLex** benchmark, which comprises 1,888 pairs in 13 languages, and other datasets like **SimVerb-3500** and **SimLex-999** for specific languages.

2. **Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI)**: The authors refer to using datasets for 10 language pairs, which are likely sourced from existing bilingual dictionaries or translation datasets.

3. **Lexical Relation Prediction (RELP)**: The authors mention using WordNet-based evaluation data, which contains 10K annotated word pairs per language.

4. **Lexical Simplification (LexSIMP)**: The authors refer to standard benchmarks available for English, Italian, and Spanish.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations will provide the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For example, I will look for citations related to:
- **Multi-SimLex**: The citation will likely include the authors and the year of publication.
- **SimVerb-3500**: This will also have a specific citation detailing the authors and the context of the dataset.
- **SimLex-999**: Similar to the previous datasets, I will find the citation that describes this dataset.
- **WordNet**: This is a well-known lexical database, and I will ensure to include its citation as well.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citation is included for each one. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
