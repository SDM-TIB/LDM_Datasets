To extract datasets from the research paper titled "When More is not Necessary Better: Multilingual Auxiliary Tasks for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer of Hate Speech Detection Models," I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors investigate the impact of multilingual auxiliary tasks on hate speech detection models, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors reference various benchmarks and datasets used for hate speech detection. They mention that they rely on datasets from previous works, which may provide clues about the datasets they are using.

In the **related work section**, the authors discuss several datasets used in hate speech detection, including references to specific studies. This section may contain valuable information about the datasets they are utilizing.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe their experiments and mention specific datasets used for hate speech detection across different languages. They refer to datasets for English, Spanish, and Italian, specifically mentioning hate speech towards immigrants and women.

The paper lists the following datasets:

1. **Hate Speech Dataset for Immigrants (English)**: Contains 4,500 tweets.
2. **Hate Speech Dataset for Immigrants (Spanish)**: Contains 1,618 tweets.
3. **Hate Speech Dataset for Immigrants (Italian)**: Contains 2,500 tweets.
4. **Hate Speech Dataset for Women (English)**: Contains 4,500 tweets.
5. **Hate Speech Dataset for Women (Spanish)**: Contains 2,882 tweets.
6. **Hate Speech Dataset for Women (Italian)**: Contains 2,500 tweets.

Next, I will check the **appendices** for any additional details about the datasets, such as their sources, preprocessing steps, or specific characteristics. The authors may provide citations or references to the original sources of these datasets.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This includes checking the references section for the original papers or datasets that the authors used.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Finally, I will ensure that all the extracted information is organized and ready for further processing or review.
