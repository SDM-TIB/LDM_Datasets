To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Issue-oriented Syllabus Retrieval System based on Terminology-based Syllabus Structuring and Visualization" by Hideki Mima, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a syllabus retrieval system but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, it does indicate that the system is in practical use for syllabi from the University of Tokyo’s Open Course Ware and the School/Department of Engineering.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **evaluation** sections to identify any datasets used for testing or evaluation purposes. In the evaluation section, the paper mentions that usability evaluations were conducted based on questionnaires used to survey over 100 students. This suggests that there is a dataset related to the survey responses, but I need to find more details.

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that might summarize data or datasets. The paper includes tables that present breakdowns of positive statements and recommendations for improvement based on the survey, which indicates that there is a dataset derived from the survey responses.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if any external datasets or sources are cited that could be relevant. The references include various papers, but they do not seem to point to specific datasets used in this research.

After reviewing the paper, I have identified the following datasets:

1. **University of Tokyo’s Open Course Ware (UT-OCW)**: This dataset consists of syllabi from various courses offered at the University of Tokyo, which are publicly available online. The paper mentions that the system is currently in practical use for syllabus retrieval from this source.

2. **Survey Dataset**: This dataset is derived from usability evaluations based on questionnaires used to survey over 100 students regarding the efficiency of the proposed syllabus retrieval system. While the paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset, it is important to note that it is based on the authors' own research.

For the citations, I will provide the relevant references for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **University of Tokyo’s Open Course Ware (UT-OCW)**, the citation is:
  > University of Tokyo. *Open Course Ware*. Available at: http://ocw.u-tokyo.ac.jp/

- For the **Survey Dataset**, since it is based on the authors' own research, I will reference the paper itself:
  > Mima, H. (2012). An Issue-oriented Syllabus Retrieval System based on Terminology-based Syllabus Structuring and Visualization. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Speech and Language Processing Tools in Education, pages 25–36, COLING 2012, Mumbai, December 2012.

Now that I have identified and documented the datasets along with their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
