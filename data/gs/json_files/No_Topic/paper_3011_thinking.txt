To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Facial Expression Recognition by De-expression Residue Learning" by Huiyuan Yang, Umur Ciftci, and Lijun Yin, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors employed **seven public facial expression databases** for their experiments, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used:

1. **BU-4DFE**: This dataset is used for pre-training the generative model. It contains 60,600 images from 101 subjects, each showing six sequences of basic facial expressions.
   
2. **CK+**: The Extended Cohn-Kanade dataset consists of 593 video sequences from 123 subjects, labeled with one of seven expressions.

3. **Oulu-CASIA**: This dataset includes 480 video sequences from 80 subjects, captured under different illumination conditions.

4. **MMI**: The MMI database consists of 236 image sequences from 31 subjects, each labeled with one of six basic facial expressions.

5. **BU-3DFE**: This dataset contains 2,500 pairs of static 3D face models and texture images from 100 subjects, with various expressions.

6. **BP4D+**: A multimodal spontaneous emotion corpus that includes synchronized 3D, 2D, and physiological data from 140 subjects.

7. **BP4D**: This dataset is used for cross-database validation, containing labeled frames based on facial action units.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
