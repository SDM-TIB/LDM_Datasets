To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Scalable ℓ∞-constrained Near-lossless Image Compression via Joint Lossy Image and Residual Compression" by Yuanchao Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a novel image compression framework but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will look for references to datasets in the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of image compression but do not specify any datasets. I will then move to the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation.

In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors mention that they evaluate their near-lossless codec on four datasets:

1. **Kodak Dataset**: This dataset consists of 24 uncompressed 768 × 512 color images. The authors reference it as a standard dataset for evaluating image compression methods.

2. **DIV2K Dataset**: This dataset consists of 100 2K resolution color images and is originally built for image super-resolution tasks. The authors note that it contains high-quality images suitable for training their codec.

3. **CLIC Professional Validation Dataset (CLIC.p)**: This dataset consists of 41 color images taken by professional photographers, used for validation purposes.

4. **CLIC Mobile Validation Dataset (CLIC.m)**: This dataset consists of 61 color images taken using mobile phones, also used for validation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Kodak Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Eastman Kodak. Kodak lossless true color image suite (photocd pcd0992), 1993. http://r0k.us/graphics/kodak/.

- For the **DIV2K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Eirikur Agustsson and Radu Timofte. NTIRE 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: dataset and study. In IEEE Conf. Comput. Vis. Pattern Recog. Worksh., July 2017.

- For the **CLIC Professional Validation Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Workshop and Challenge on Learned Image Compression. https://www.compression.cc/challenge/.

- For the **CLIC Mobile Validation Dataset**, the citation is the same as above since both datasets are part of the CLIC challenge.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation.
