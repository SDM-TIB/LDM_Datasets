To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expressing the Opposite: Acoustic Cues of Thai Verbal Irony" by Nimit Kumwapee and Sujinat Jitwiriyanont, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the study's focus on acoustic cues of sarcasm in Thai, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the concept of verbal irony and its linguistic implications, but again, no specific datasets are referenced.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** in detail, particularly the **participants** and **data collection** subsections. Here, the authors describe the participants (two male and two female Thai speakers) and the tasks they performed, but they do not refer to any external datasets. Instead, they mention the creation of two sets of materials: the Baseline Reading Set and the Biased Reading Set, which consist of sentences prepared for the study.

In the **data collection** subsection, the authors explain how the recordings were made and the number of tokens collected (240 tokens). However, these are not datasets in the traditional sense; they are results generated from the study's own experimental design.

Moving on to the **results and discussion sections**, I will look for any references to existing datasets used for comparison or validation. The authors cite various studies throughout the paper, but they do not mention any specific datasets that were utilized in their research.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets. While many references are made to previous studies, they primarily focus on acoustic characteristics and do not provide specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no external datasets explicitly mentioned or utilized in this study. The authors conducted their own experiments and collected their own data, which does not qualify as a dataset from an external source.

Since no datasets were found, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets as none exist in this paper. Instead, I will summarize the findings and methodologies used in the study, which may be useful for future research or comparisons.

In conclusion, I will document that the paper does not reference any external datasets, and I will note the experimental design and data collection methods used by the authors for their own analysis of sarcasm in Thai.
