To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SemEval-2021 Task 8: MeasEval – Extracting Counts and Measurements and their Related Contexts" by Corey A Harper et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a dataset for the MeasEval task, which indicates that there is a dataset involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **data model** and **annotated data** sections, particularly **section 4**. Here, the authors describe the MeasEval dataset in detail, including its composition and the number of annotated paragraphs and quantities. They mention that the dataset includes annotations drawn from 110 CC-BY licensed articles, which is crucial information.

In **section 4.2**, the authors provide specific details about the dataset, stating that it includes 428 paragraphs containing 1663 quantities, split into training and evaluation sets. This section confirms the existence of a structured dataset used for the task.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references several related works and datasets, which may provide additional context or authoritative citations.

The key dataset identified is the **MeasEval dataset**, which is derived from the 110 articles. The citation for this dataset is as follows:
> Corey A. Harper, Jessica Cox, Curt Kohler, Antony Scerri, Ron Daniel, Jr., and Paul Groth. *SemEval-2021 Task 8: MeasEval – Extracting Counts and Measurements and their Related Contexts*. In Proceedings of the Fifteenth Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2021), pages 306–316, Bangkok, Thailand (online), August 5–6, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MeasEval dataset as it is the primary dataset discussed in the paper. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets presented in the research paper.
