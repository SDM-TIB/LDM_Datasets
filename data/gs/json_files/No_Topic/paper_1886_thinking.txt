To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relative Instance Credibility Inference for Learning with Noisy Labels," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on "several benchmark datasets and a real-world noisy dataset," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention evaluating their method on the following datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
2. **CIFAR10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
3. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset, which consists of over 600,000 digit images collected from house numbers in Google Street View images.
4. **ANIMAL10**: A real-world dataset with a known mislabeling ratio of 8%, but the corruption process and noise type are unspecified.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. 2011.

- For **ANIMAL10**, the citation is:
  > Hwanjun Song, Minseok Kim, and Jae-Gil Lee. *Selfie: Refurbishing unclean samples for robust deep learning*. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 5907–5915. PMLR, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work or analysis.
