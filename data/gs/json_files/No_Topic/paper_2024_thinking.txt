To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sentiment Analysis for Low Resource Languages: A Study on Informal Indonesian Tweets" by Tuan Anh Le et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used "four thousand manually labeled tweets" for their sentiment analysis model. This suggests that there is a specific dataset that I need to describe.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Data Collection)**, where the authors detail their data collection process. They mention collecting **900,000 Indonesian tweets** from Twitter Public Streams using a Python script and the Tweepy package. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

In **section 4.2 (Data labeling)**, the authors specify that they manually labeled **4,000 tweets** with eight sentiment categories (POS, NEG, NEU, FOR, RET, ADV, INF, XXX). This indicates that the labeled dataset is a subset of the larger collection of tweets.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors do not provide a formal citation for the dataset of tweets they collected, as it is based on their own data collection efforts. However, I can note that the dataset consists of tweets collected from Twitter's public API.

The relevant datasets I will document are:

1. **Indonesian Tweets Dataset**: This dataset consists of 900,000 tweets collected from Twitter's public streams, which were later filtered down to 4,000 manually labeled tweets for sentiment analysis.

2. **Labeled Tweets Dataset**: A subset of the Indonesian Tweets Dataset, containing 4,000 tweets that were manually labeled with eight sentiment categories.

Since the authors did not provide formal citations for these datasets, I will note that they are derived from their own collection and labeling efforts.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly describe each dataset and its significance in the context of the research.
