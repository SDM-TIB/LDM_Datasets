To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Efficient Technique for De-noising Sentences using Monolingual Corpus and Synonym Dictionary" by Sanjay Chatterji et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the method but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of noisy sentences but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **experimental results section** to see if any datasets are referenced there.

In **section 5 (Experimental Results)**, the authors mention using a **Hindi and Bengali monolingual corpus** for their experiments. This indicates that they utilized specific datasets for their evaluation, but I need to gather more details about these datasets.

Next, I will look for any specific references to the datasets in the **experimental setup** subsection (5.1). Here, the authors state that they used a **Hindi monolingual corpus** of 300K sentences and a **Bengali monolingual corpus** of 430K sentences. However, they do not provide specific citations for these corpora.

Since the paper does not provide full citations for the datasets, I will need to acknowledge that the datasets are described but not formally cited. I will note that these datasets are likely derived from publicly available resources or web crawls, but without specific references, I cannot provide formal citations.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:

1. **Hindi Monolingual Corpus**: A dataset containing 300K sentences, used for training and evaluation in the context of noise correction in sentences.
2. **Bengali Monolingual Corpus**: A dataset containing 430K sentences, also used for training and evaluation in the same context.

Since there are no formal citations provided in the paper for these datasets, I will document them as described above, noting the lack of specific references.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity, while acknowledging the absence of formal citations.
