To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AstroNet: When Astrocyte Meets Artificial Neural Network" by Mengqiao Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on classification tasks using three public datasets. This indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the provided text, the authors state that they conducted experiments on three public datasets: **ImageNet-1k**, **CIFAR**, and **MNIST**. I will note these datasets down for further investigation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

1. **ImageNet-1k**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

2. **CIFAR**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

3. **MNIST**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Li Deng. *The mnist database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research [best of the web]*. IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 29(6):141–142, 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.
