To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WMDO: Fluency-based Word Moverâ€™s Distance for Machine Translation Evaluation" by Julian Chow et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed metric but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses various existing metrics but does not mention datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental settings)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that they used the **WMT17 segment-level into-English datasets** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved, and I need to gather more details about it.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset as containing data from seven different source languages, with 560 different texts each. Each text includes a reference translation and a machine translation, along with human annotations indicating how closely the machine translation relates to the reference. This description provides a good overview of the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WMT17 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **WMT17 segment-level into-English datasets**, the citation is:
  > Ondrej Bojar, Yvette Graham, and Amir Kamran. *Results of the WMT17 metrics shared task*. Proceedings of the Second Conference on Machine Translation, pages 489-513, 2017.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset:

1. **WMT17 segment-level into-English datasets**: This dataset includes data from seven different source languages, with 560 different texts each. Each text carries a reference translation and a machine translation, with human annotations labeling how closely the machine translation relates to the reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
