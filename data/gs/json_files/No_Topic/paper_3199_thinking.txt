To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lightweight Word-Level Confidence Estimation for Neural Interactive Translation Prediction" by Rebecca Knowles and Philipp Koehn, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of features for estimating confidence in translation suggestions, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper.

In the **introduction**, the authors describe the context of their research, focusing on neural interactive translation prediction. They reference previous works but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** for more details.

In **section 3 (Experiments & Results)**, the authors mention using the University of Edinburgh’s neural models from WMT 2016 for various language pairs. They specify that they use WMT 2016 test data for training and development, which consists of between 64,000 and 73,000 tokens. This indicates that the WMT 2016 dataset is a primary dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for the **full citation** of the WMT 2016 dataset in the **References section**. The relevant citation is:

> Rico Sennrich, Barry Haddow, and Alexandra Birch. *Edinburgh neural machine translation systems for WMT 16*. In Proceedings of the First Conference on Machine Translation (WMT), 2016.

Additionally, the authors mention using WMT 2017 test data for reporting results, which is also important. I will check the references for its citation:

> Ondřej Bojar, Rajen Chatterjee, Christian Federmann, Yvette Graham, Barry Haddow, Shujian Huang, Matthias Huck, Philipp Koehn, Qun Liu, Varvara Logacheva, Christof Monz, Matteo Negri, Matt Post, Raphael Rubino, Lucia Specia, and Marco Turchi. *Findings of the 2017 conference on machine translation (wmt17)*. In Proceedings of the Second Conference on Machine Translation, Volume 2: Shared Task Papers, pages 169–214, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **WMT 2016 Dataset**: Used for training and development, consisting of between 64,000 and 73,000 tokens.
   - Citation: Rico Sennrich, Barry Haddow, and Alexandra Birch. *Edinburgh neural machine translation systems for WMT 16*. In Proceedings of the First Conference on Machine Translation (WMT), 2016.

2. **WMT 2017 Dataset**: Used for reporting results.
   - Citation: Ondřej Bojar et al. *Findings of the 2017 conference on machine translation (wmt17)*. In Proceedings of the Second Conference on Machine Translation, Volume 2: Shared Task Papers, pages 169–214, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2017.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries for further processing.
