To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEJFEK — a Lexicon and a Shallow Grammar of Polish Economic Multi-Word Units" by Agata Savary et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the SEJFEK resource, which includes a grammatical lexicon and a shallow grammar, but it does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Grammatical Lexicon of Polish Economic Phraseology)**, where the authors describe the construction of the lexicon. Here, they mention that the lexicon consists of about 11,000 terminological multi-word units (MWUs). I will look for any specific datasets or sources from which these MWUs were derived.

In **section 2.1 (Knowledge Sources)**, the authors list various web sources and printed lexicons used to compile the dataset. They mention:

1. **Encyklopedia Zarządzania**: A collaborative Wiki framework containing about 4,000 terms.
2. **Money.pl, Bankier.pl, and NBPortal.pl**: Smaller web lexicons targeted for economic terminology.
3. **Official portals of Polish financial and political institutions**: Such as the Polish National Bank and the Ministry of Finance.
4. **Traditional printed economic lexicons**: Including works by Samuelson and Nordhaus, Głuchowski and Szambelańczyk, and others.

These sources are critical as they form the basis of the dataset used in the research.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the printed lexicons mentioned in the paper are:

- For **Samuelson and Nordhaus (2003)**:
  > Samuelson, A. and Nordhaus, W. D. (2003). *Ekonomia, volume 1*. Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN, Warszawa.

- For **Głuchowski and Szambelańczyk (1999)**:
  > Głuchowski, J. and Szambelańczyk, J., editors (1999). *Bankowość. Podręcznik dla studentów*. Wydawnictwo Wyższej Szkoły Bankowej, Poznań.

- For **Samuelson and Nordhaus (1998)**:
  > Samuelson, A. and Nordhaus, W. D. (1998). *Ekonomia, volume 2*. Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN, Warszawa.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the identified sources and their citations. 

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented each dataset with its full citation, ready for any further processing or review.
