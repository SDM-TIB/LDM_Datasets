To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SemEval-2016 Task 7: Determining Sentiment Intensity of English and Arabic Phrases" by Svetlana Kiritchenko and Saif M. Mohammad, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that three datasets were assembled for different domains: general English, English Twitter, and Arabic Twitter. This suggests that I should look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets of English and Arabic Terms Annotated for Sentiment Intensity)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **General English Sentiment Modifiers Set**: This dataset includes English single words and multi-word phrases from the general domain, specifically phrases formed by combining a word with a modifier. The total number of terms in this dataset is 2,999.

2. **English Twitter Mixed Polarity Set**: This dataset consists of English phrases made up of opposing polarity terms, along with single-word terms. The total number of terms in this dataset is 1,269.

3. **Arabic Twitter Set**: This dataset includes single words and phrases commonly found in Arabic tweets, specifically formed by combining a negator and a word. The total number of terms in this dataset is 1,366.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **General English Sentiment Modifiers Set**, the citation is:
  > Kiritchenko, S., & Mohammad, S. M. (2016). Capturing reliable fine-grained sentiment associations by crowdsourcing and best–worst scaling.

- For the **English Twitter Mixed Polarity Set**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
