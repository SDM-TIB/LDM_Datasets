To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WLSI-OIAF4HLT 2016," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the main sections of the paper** to locate any references to datasets. Since this paper is a collection of workshop proceedings, I will pay special attention to the individual papers listed in the table of contents, as they may contain specific datasets relevant to their respective studies.

Next, I will examine the **papers categorized under the three parts** of the proceedings. Each paper may describe datasets used in their research. I will look for sections that typically discuss datasets, such as "Methodology," "Experiments," or "Data." 

For instance, in the first part, I will check the paper by Mohanty et al. on "Kathaa" to see if they mention any datasets used for their NLP application. Similarly, I will do the same for the other papers, such as Ide et al.'s work on LAPPS/Galaxy, Castilho's analysis of pre-trained models, and Nakaguchi et al.'s multi-language support system.

As I identify datasets, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details provided by the authors. I will also check the **References section** of the proceedings to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

For example, if the paper by Aili and Mushajiang discusses a Uyghur dependency Treebank, I will note that down and look for the citation in the references. Similarly, if Luong and Vu provide a dataset for Vietnamese speech recognition, I will extract that information and its citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are accurate and complete, ready for any further processing or review.
