To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TAC at SemEval-2020 Task 12: Ensembling Approach for Multilingual Offensive Language Identification in Social Media" by Talha Anwar and Mirza Omer Beg, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper deals with offensive language detection across five languages, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the SemEval 2020 task, which is a clear indication that datasets are being utilized for the multilingual offensive language identification task. I will look for specific dataset names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methodology and Data)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. They mention that the SemEval shared task consists of datasets for five languages: Arabic, Turkish, Danish, Greek, and English. The paper also specifies the datasets used for the English task, which are the **OLID dataset** and the **SOLID dataset**.

The paper includes a table (Table 1) that summarizes the training dataset sizes for each language, which provides additional context about the datasets used. The authors also mention that the datasets are imbalanced, particularly highlighting the Danish dataset as the smallest and most imbalanced.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **OLID Dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
