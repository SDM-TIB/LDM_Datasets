To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Object-Oriented Representation for Efficient Reinforcement Learning" by Carlos Diuk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the introduction of Object-Oriented MDPs and a learning algorithm, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to delve deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **Taxi domain** and the **Pitfall videogame** as environments for testing their algorithm. I will need to gather more details about these environments to determine if they are publicly available datasets or if they are custom setups created for the experiments.

In the **Taxi domain** subsection, the authors refer to the original 5 × 5 grid version and an extended 10 × 10 version. They cite the work of Dietterich (2000) as the source for the Taxi domain. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset.

In the **Pitfall** subsection, the authors describe the video game and its mechanics but do not provide a specific dataset citation. However, since it is a well-known game, I will note that it is based on the original game released by Activision in 1982.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Taxi domain:

- For the **Taxi domain**, the citation is:
  > Dietterich, T. G. (2000). Hierarchical reinforcement learning with the MAXQ value function decomposition. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 13, 227–303.

The Pitfall game does not have a formal dataset citation since it is a classic video game, but I will note its significance in the context of the experiments.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Taxi Domain**: A grid-based environment used for reinforcement learning experiments, originally introduced by Dietterich in 2000.
2. **Pitfall Video Game**: A classic video game environment used for testing the proposed algorithm, released by Activision in 1982.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
