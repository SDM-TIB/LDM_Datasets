To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Uncertainty-Aware Prediction for Graph Neural Networks," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validated their proposed method on **six real network datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they list the datasets as follows:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 7 classes, and 1,433 features.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, 6 classes, and 3,703 features.
3. **Pubmed**: A dataset with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, 3 classes, and 500 features.
4. **Coauthor Physics**: A co-authorship graph dataset with 34,493 nodes, 282,455 edges, 5 classes, and 8,415 features.
5. **Amazon Computer**: A co-purchase graph dataset with 13,381 nodes, 259,159 edges, 10 classes, and 767 features.
6. **Amazon Photo**: Another co-purchase graph dataset with 7,487 nodes, 126,530 edges, 8 classes, and 745 features.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the following papers for the datasets:

- For **Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed**:
  > Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Galligher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3):93, 2008.

- For **Coauthor Physics, Amazon Computer, and Amazon Photo**:
  > Julian McAuley, Christopher Targett, Qinfeng Shi, and Anton Van Den Hengel. *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In SIGIR, pp. 43â€“52. ACM, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining the importance of including full citations for each dataset as specified.
