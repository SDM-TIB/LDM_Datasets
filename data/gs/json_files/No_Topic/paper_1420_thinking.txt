To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identify the Nash Equilibrium in Static Games with Random Payoffs" by Yichi Zhou, Jialian Li, and Jun Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on learning Nash Equilibrium in games with random payoffs, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the theoretical background and motivation for the study but does not specify any datasets used for experiments or analysis.

I will then look into the **experiments section** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for empirical validation. However, upon reviewing the text, it appears that the paper primarily discusses algorithms and theoretical results without detailing specific datasets.

Since the paper does not mention any datasets explicitly, I will check the **references section** for any cited works that may include datasets relevant to the study. The references include various papers related to game theory and algorithms, but they do not provide specific datasets.

Given that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract for this particular research paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets, as none are present in the text.

In summary, I will document that the paper does not contain any datasets, and thus, there are no citations to provide. This process highlights the importance of thoroughly reviewing each section of a research paper to identify relevant datasets, even if they are not explicitly stated.
