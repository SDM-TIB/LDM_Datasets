To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Large Rated Lexicon with French Medical Words" by Natalia Grabar and Thierry Hamon, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a lexicon of French medical words rated for understandability, which suggests that there is a dataset involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or collections of data in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **methodology** sections, particularly focusing on the **pre-processing** and **annotation process**. Here, the authors describe how they processed a set of 29,641 unique words and how these words were annotated by three annotators. This indicates that the dataset consists of these words and their corresponding ratings.

In the **results** section, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the data collected. For instance, Table 1 presents the number of words assigned to different categories based on the annotators' ratings. This table provides quantitative insights into the dataset.

I will also check the **discussion** and **conclusion** sections for any additional context or implications regarding the dataset. The authors discuss the potential applications of the lexicon, which reinforces its significance as a dataset.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **Rated Lexicon of French Medical Words**: This dataset consists of 29,641 unique French medical words that have been rated by annotators on their understandability. The words are categorized into three groups: "I can understand," "I am not sure," and "I cannot understand." The dataset is freely available for research purposes and can be accessed online.

Next, I will gather the full citation for the dataset. The paper itself provides a URL where the lexicon can be accessed, which serves as the citation for the dataset:

- For the **Rated Lexicon of French Medical Words**, the citation is:
  > Grabar, N., & Hamon, T. (2023). A Large Rated Lexicon with French Medical Words. Available at: http://natalia.grabar.perso.sfr.fr/rated-lexicon.html.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of the dataset and its citation, ready for any further processing or presentation.
