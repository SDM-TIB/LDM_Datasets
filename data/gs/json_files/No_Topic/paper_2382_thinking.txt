To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On nature and causes of observed MT errors" by Maja Popović, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study involves two publicly available datasets containing machine translation (MT) outputs with highlighted translation errors. This suggests that datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **Data Sets** section (Section 2), where the author explicitly describes the datasets used in the study. Here, I will look for specific details about each dataset, including their names, language pairs, domains, and any relevant statistics.

The paper mentions two datasets:

1. **DCU Dataset**: This dataset was created for MT evaluation and consists of English user reviews translated into Croatian and Serbian. It includes outputs from ten different MT systems and focuses on two quality criteria: adequacy and comprehension.

2. **HU Dataset**: This dataset consists of English TED talks translated into German by a single MT system. Unlike the DCU dataset, it does not specify a quality criterion for error marking.

I will also gather statistics provided in Table 1, which summarizes the characteristics of both datasets, such as the number of segments, the number of MT systems involved, and the percentage of marked errors.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper provides links to the datasets, which I will use to construct the citations:

- For the **DCU Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Popović, M. (2020a). *Informative manual evaluation of machine translation output*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 20), Online. Available at: https://github.com/m-popovic/QRev-annotations

- For the **HU Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kreutzer, J., Berger, N., and Riezler, S. (2020). *Correct Me If You Can: Learning from Error Corrections and Markings*. Proceedings of the 22nd Annual Conference of the European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT 20).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details, including their names, language pairs, domains, quality criteria, and full citations.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the representation of the information extracted from the paper.
