To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Auto-Encoding Dictionary Definitions into Consistent Word Embeddings" by Tom Bosc and Pascal Vincent, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of dictionary definitions for training word embeddings, which suggests that there may be datasets related to dictionaries or specific definitions used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to identify any datasets explicitly mentioned. In section 4.1, the authors state that they experiment on English using the **WordNet** dictionary, which is a significant dataset for their work. This indicates that WordNet is a primary resource for their experiments.

In section 4.2, the authors discuss various benchmarks for evaluating their embeddings, including **SimVerb3500**, **MEN**, **RG**, **WS353**, **SCWS**, and **MTurk**. These benchmarks are datasets used to assess the performance of the proposed model on similarity and relatedness tasks.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the findings from the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
