To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Toward Efficient Low-Precision Training: Data Format Optimization and Hysteresis Quantization" by Sunwoo Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses low-precision training and mentions the use of various models, which may imply the presence of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using **ImageNet** for training their models, specifically ResNet-18, ResNet-101, and MobileNetV2. This is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for ImageNet is as follows:
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 248–255, 2009.

Additionally, the paper mentions using the **Penn Treebank (PTB)** dataset for language modeling with a 2-layer LSTM. I will look for the citation for this dataset as well. The citation for the Penn Treebank is:
> Mitchell Marcus, Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. 1993.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The datasets identified are:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset used for training various models.
   - Citation: Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 248–255, 2009.

2. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: A dataset used for language modeling with LSTM.
   - Citation: Mitchell Marcus, Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. 1993.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
