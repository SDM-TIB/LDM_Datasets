To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CI-AVSR: A Cantonese Audio-Visual Speech Dataset for In-car Command Recognition" by Wenliang Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **Cantonese In-car Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (CI-AVSR)** dataset, which is a clear indication that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will move to the **introduction section**. Here, the authors elaborate on the significance of the CI-AVSR dataset, stating that it consists of 4,984 samples of in-car commands recorded by 30 native Cantonese speakers. This section reinforces the importance of the CI-AVSR dataset for their research.

In the **dataset collection and statistics section (Section 3)**, the authors provide detailed information about the CI-AVSR dataset, including its composition, the data collection process, and the augmentation methods used. They mention that the dataset includes both clean and augmented versions, which is crucial for understanding its scope and application.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors reference the CI-AVSR dataset in the context of their experiments. They do mention using this dataset to evaluate their models, confirming its relevance.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the CI-AVSR dataset. Since the dataset is introduced in this paper, the citation will be the same as the paper itself:

- For the **Cantonese In-car Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (CI-AVSR)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Wenliang Dai, Samuel Cahyawijaya, Tiezheng Yu, Elham J. Barezi, Peng Xu, Cheuk Tung Shadow Yiu, Rita Frieske, Holy Lovenia, Genta Indra Winata, Qifeng Chen, Xiaojuan Ma, Bertram E. Shi, Pascale Fung. *CI-AVSR: A Cantonese Audio-Visual Speech Dataset for In-car Command Recognition*. In Proceedings of the 13th Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2022), pages 6786â€“6793, Marseille, 20-25 June 2022.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
