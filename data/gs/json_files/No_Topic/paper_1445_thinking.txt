To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Self-supervised Joint Training Framework for Document Reranking" by Xiaozhi Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **MS MARCO passage ranking** and **TREC Robust 2004** datasets, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they describe:

1. **MS MARCO Passage Ranking**: This dataset consists of real anonymous questions from the Bing search engine and includes 8.8 million candidate passages. The training set has about 500,000 positive query-passage pairs, with each query having one relevant passage on average. The development and evaluation sets contain 6,980 and 6,837 queries, respectively.

2. **TREC Robust 2004**: This dataset is a newswire collection used by the TREC 2004 Robust track, comprising 250 queries and 0.5 million documents. The authors mention using a five-fold cross-validation setup for training, validation, and testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MS MARCO**, the citation is:
  > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. In CoCo@ NIPs, 2016.

- For **TREC Robust 2004**, the citation is:
  > Ellen M. Voorhees. *Overview of the TREC 2004 Robust Retrieval Track*. 

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **MS MARCO Passage Ranking**: A large-scale dataset consisting of real questions and candidate passages for passage reranking tasks.
2. **TREC Robust 2004**: A dataset used for evaluating document retrieval systems, consisting of queries and documents from newswire sources.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for further processing or review.
