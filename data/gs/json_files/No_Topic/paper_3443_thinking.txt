To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Randomized tests for high-dimensional regression: A more efficient and powerful solution" by Yue Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction, where the authors often discuss the context and may reference datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments or datasets**. In this paper, the authors may describe the datasets they used to validate their proposed methods. I will carefully read through these sections to find any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

If the paper includes a **results or evaluation section**, I will check there as well, as authors often mention datasets again when discussing their findings or comparing their results with previous work.

Once I identify any datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a synthetic dataset generated for their experiments, I will look for the original source or any relevant papers that describe this dataset in detail. If they reference publicly available datasets, I will ensure to capture the correct citation format as provided in the references.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as per the references in the paper.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or review.
