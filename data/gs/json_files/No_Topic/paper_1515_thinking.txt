To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-tuning de modèles de langues pour la veille épidémiologique multilingue avec peu de ressources" by Stephen Mutuvi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction and methodology sections are likely to contain specific details about the datasets used.

In **section 2.1 (Jeu de données et verrous scientifiques)**, the authors explicitly mention the **DANIEL corpus** as the dataset used for their study. They describe it as containing articles in multiple languages: English, Greek, Russian, and Polish, with specific counts of articles in each language. This section provides a clear indication of the dataset's structure and purpose.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DANIEL corpus. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the **DANIEL corpus**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will ensure that I have all the necessary details to describe it accurately.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
