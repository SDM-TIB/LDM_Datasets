To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparative Graph-based Summarization of Scientific Papers Guided by Comparative Citations" by Jingqiang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the problem and the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the construction of a **Comparative Scientific Summarization Corpus (CSSC)**, which is a key dataset for their experiments. This indicates that CSSC is central to their research.

Next, I will look into **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. They mention the CSSC dataset, which contains 40 groups of comparable scientific papers and corresponding reference summaries. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in the experiments.

The authors also reference two additional datasets, **DUC2006** and **DUC2007**, which are commonly used benchmarks for multi-document summarization tasks. They provide statistics about these datasets, indicating their significance in evaluating the proposed method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Comparative Scientific Summarization Corpus (CSSC)**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for CSSC since it is a dataset constructed by the authors themselves. However, I will note that it is a novel dataset created for this research.

2. **DUC2006 Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > "DUC2006: Document Understanding Conference 2006. Available at: http://duc.nist.gov/."

3. **DUC2007 Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > "DUC2007: Document Understanding Conference 2007. Available at: http://duc.nist.gov/."

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **CSSC**: A dataset constructed by the authors for comparative scientific summarization, containing 40 groups of comparable scientific papers and corresponding reference summaries.
- **DUC2006**: A benchmark dataset for multi-document summarization tasks.
- **DUC2007**: Another benchmark dataset for multi-document summarization tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
