To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning-Based Frequency Estimation Algorithms" by Chen-Yu Hsu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their algorithms on **two real-world datasets**, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Internet Traffic Dataset**: This dataset is collected at a backbone link of a Tier1 ISP between Chicago and Seattle in 2016 (CAIDA). The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of packets and unique flows, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

2. **AOL Query Log Dataset**: This dataset consists of 21 million search queries collected from 650 thousand users over 90 days. The authors mention the number of unique queries and provide context about how the dataset is used for estimating search query frequencies.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Internet Traffic Dataset**, the citation is:
> CAIDA. *CAIDA Internet Traces 2016 Chicago*. Available at: http://www.caida.org/data/monitors/passive-equinix-chicago.xml.

For the **AOL Query Log Dataset**, the citation is:
> Pass et al. *The AOL Search Log Dataset*. Available at: http://www.aol.com.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
