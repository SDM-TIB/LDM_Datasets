To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Section-Aware Commonsense Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Generation with Pre-trained Language Model" by Sixing Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a "Chinese dataset" and refers to the "Weibo dataset" in the context of dialogue generation, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methods. Here, they specifically mention the **Weibo dataset** (Wu et al., 2020a) as the primary dataset used for their experiments. This dataset is described as containing over 1 million dialogues collected from the Weibo social media platform, along with commonsense knowledge facts sourced from ConceptNet.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide additional context about the dataset, including its size and the number of commonsense knowledge facts, which further confirms its significance in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Weibo dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- **Weibo dataset**:
  > Sixing Wu, Ying Li, Dawei Zhang, Yang Zhou, and Zhonghai Wu. *Diverse and informative dialogue generation with context-specific commonsense knowledge awareness*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 5811–5820, 2020.

Additionally, the authors mention that commonsense knowledge facts were collected from **ConceptNet** (Speer et al., 2017). I will also retrieve the citation for ConceptNet from the references:

- **ConceptNet**:
  > Robyn Speer, Joshua Chin, and Catherine Havasi. *ConceptNet 5.5: An open multilingual graph of general knowledge*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pages 4444–4451, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details and citations are included.
