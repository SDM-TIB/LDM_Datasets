To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building Monolingual Word Alignment Corpus for the Greater China Region" by Fan Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that two monolingual GCR corpora have been constructed, which suggests that datasets are present.

Next, I will look for specific details in the **main body of the paper**, particularly in sections that discuss the datasets. In this case, I will focus on sections that describe the construction and characteristics of the datasets. 

In **section 4 (GCR Word Dictionary Corpus)**, the authors describe the first dataset:
1. **GCR Word Dictionary Corpus**: This dataset consists of 11,623 triples, which were automatically extracted and manually annotated from 30 million sentence pairs sourced from Wikipedia. This dataset is crucial for understanding word alignments across different Mandarin dialects.

Then, I will examine **section 5 (GCR Word Alignment Corpus)**, where the authors detail the second dataset:
2. **GCR Word Alignment Corpus**: This dataset contains 12,000 manually annotated sentence pairs obtained from Wikipedia and news websites. It serves as a resource for word alignment tasks within the Greater China Region.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets. However, since the datasets are original contributions of the authors, they may not have separate citations. Instead, I will note the paper itself as the source of these datasets.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Fan Xu, Xiongfei Xu, Mingwen Wang, Maoxi Li. *Building Monolingual Word Alignment Corpus for the Greater China Region*. In Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Language Technology for Closely Related Languages, Varieties and Dialects, pages 85â€“94, Hissar, Bulgaria, September 10, 2015.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the citation for the paper as the source of these datasets. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets extracted from the research paper.
