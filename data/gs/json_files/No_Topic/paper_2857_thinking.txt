To extract datasets from the research paper titled "APLenty: annotation tool for creating high-quality datasets using active and proactive learning" by Minh-Quoc Nghiem and Sophia Ananiadou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and case study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces APLenty as a tool for creating labeled datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of obtaining labeled data and mention various active learning libraries, but they do not specify any datasets yet. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Case Study)**, where the authors describe a specific use case for APLenty in named-entity recognition. Here, they explicitly mention using the **English CoNLL-2003 named entity dataset**. This dataset is crucial for my extraction.

The authors provide details about the dataset, stating that it contains newswire articles annotated with four entities: LOC (locations), MISC (miscellaneous names), ORG (organizations), and PER (persons). They also mention the number of sentences used for training and testing, which adds context to the dataset's application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CoNLL-2003 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Erik F Tjong Kim Sang and Fien De Meulder. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the seventh conference on Natural language learning at HLT-NAACL 2003-Volume 4, pages 142â€“147, 2003.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the CoNLL-2003 dataset, including its citation, into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, I have identified the dataset used in the paper, gathered its details, and retrieved the full citation necessary for proper referencing.
