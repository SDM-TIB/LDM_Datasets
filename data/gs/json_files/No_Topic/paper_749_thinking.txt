To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The INCOMSLAV Platform: Experimental Website with Integrated Methods for Measuring Linguistic Distances and Asymmetries in Receptive Multilingualism" by Irina Stenger et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a web-based resource for conducting intercomprehension experiments, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors describe the INCOMSLAV project and its focus on measuring linguistic distances and asymmetries in receptive multilingualism. They mention that the results, including intelligibility scores and linguistic distances, are made available in the form of a Slavic intercomprehension matrix (SlavMatrix). This hints at the existence of a dataset.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Intercomprehension resources)**, where the authors provide details about the experiments conducted. They mention that there are **162 online experiments** involving native speakers of 11 Slavic languages, German, and English. The data collected includes intelligibility scores for individual words, phrases, and words in predictive contexts. This section is crucial as it outlines the datasets generated from these experiments.

The authors also refer to the **SlavMatrix**, which contains intelligibility scores and measures of linguistic distances and asymmetries for different language pairs. This matrix is a key dataset that aggregates the results of their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The SlavMatrix is a product of the INCOMSLAV project, and while it may not have a traditional citation, it is essential to reference it properly. The authors also cite various studies and resources that contributed to their dataset, such as:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as outlined above. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
