To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Syntax-based Rewriting for Simultaneous Machine Translation" by He He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a "Reuters Japanese-English corpus," which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. They specifically mention the "Reuters Japanese-English corpus" and also refer to "EIJIRO dictionary entries and the accompanying example sentences." This suggests that both the Reuters corpus and the EIJIRO dictionary are datasets relevant to their research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Reuters Japanese-English Corpus**: The citation is:
   > Masao Utiyama and Hitoshi Isahara. *Reliable measures for aligning Japanese-English news articles and sentences*. In Proceedings of the annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 72â€“79, 2003.

2. **EIJIRO Dictionary**: The citation is:
   > Eijiro. *Eijiro on the Web*. Available at http://eijiro.jp.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
