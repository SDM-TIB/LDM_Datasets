To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Dual Adversarial Model for Generating 3D Point Cloud," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on 3D point clouds and the MNIST dataset, which suggests that these datasets are important for their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dual Generation Model for Learning Representation)**, where the authors describe their architecture and the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they specifically mention using the **ShapeNet dataset** for their experiments, which is crucial for understanding their model's performance.

In **section 5 (Evaluation)**, the authors also refer to the **MNIST dataset** when discussing their experiments on 2D data generation. This confirms that both ShapeNet and MNIST are key datasets utilized in their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ShapeNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > Angel X. Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, and Su Hao. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. Computer Science, 2015.

2. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. 2010.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
