To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finite State Intensional Semantics" by Mats Rooth, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract typically provides a concise overview of the paper's contributions and may highlight any datasets used.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly focusing on sections that discuss methodology, experiments, or implementations. In this paper, I will pay special attention to sections that might describe computational implementations or examples, as these often include datasets or references to data sources.

I will also look for any **figures, tables, or code snippets** that might indicate the use of specific datasets. These sections often provide practical examples that can lead to the identification of datasets.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details provided by the authors. I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and to allow others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset used for testing a model, I will look for the following information:
- The name of the dataset.
- A brief description of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the research.
- The full citation for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

After gathering this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.

Finally, I will review my findings to ensure that all relevant datasets have been captured and properly cited, preparing them for any further processing or documentation needs.
