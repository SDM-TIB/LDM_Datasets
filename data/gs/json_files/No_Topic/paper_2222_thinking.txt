To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamically Composing Domain-Data Selection with Clean-Data Selection by 'Co-Curricular Learning' for Neural Machine Translation" by Wei Wang, Isaac Caswell, and Ciprian Chelba, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of noise and domain in data quality for neural machine translation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using two background datasets and two test domains. Specifically, they refer to:

1. **Paracrawl Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 300 million English-French sentence pairs and is noted for being noisy.
2. **WMT14 Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 40 million English-French sentence pairs and is considered cleaner than Paracrawl.

In addition, the authors specify the use of two test domains:
- **IWSLT15 Test Set**: This is used in the spoken language domain and contains 220,000 examples.
- **WMT14 Test Set**: This is used in the news domain, with various test sets from WMT 2010-2011 mentioned for validation.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:
- For the **Paracrawl Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Paracrawl. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://paracrawl.eu
- For the **WMT14 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bojar, O., et al. (2014). *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1â€“30.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
