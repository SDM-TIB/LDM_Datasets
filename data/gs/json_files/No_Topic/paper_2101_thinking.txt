To extract datasets from the research paper titled “Don’t worry, it’s just noise”: quantifying the impact of files treated as single textual units when they are really collections by Thibault Clérice, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research involves a large corpus of Latin works, specifically a **20M tokens corpus**, which suggests that this corpus is a dataset.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. Here, the author describes the **Corpus Latin antiquité et antiquité tardive lemmatisée**, which aggregates original works from various sources, including Perseus and Open Greek and Latin. This corpus is explicitly stated to contain **21,222,911 tokens** across **853 works**. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

I will also note the three sub-corpora created from the main corpus:

1. **Martial’s Epigrammata and the anonymous Priapea**: This sub-corpus is small, with **61,082 tokens**.
2. **ATU Corpus**: This corpus consists of **125 works** and **3,549,249 tokens**.
3. **All Corpus**: This is the full corpus with **17,639,626 tokens** after removing punctuation.

In the **results section**, the author discusses the impact of treating texts as continuous units versus segmented units, which further emphasizes the importance of the datasets used in the analysis.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Corpus Latin antiquité et antiquité tardive lemmatisée**, the citation is:
  > Clérice, Thibault. *Corpus latin antiquité et antiquité tardive lemmatisée*. 2020.

- For the **Perseus** dataset, the citation is:
  > Crane, Gregory R. *Perseusdl/canonical-latinlit 0.0.752*. 2021.

- For the **Open Greek and Latin** dataset, the citation is:
  > Crane, Gregory R. *Open Greek and Latin, corpus scriptorum ecclesiasticorum latinorum*. 2021.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
