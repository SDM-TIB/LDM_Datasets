To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Superadditivity and Convex Optimization for Globally Optimal Cell Segmentation using Deformable Shape Models" by Leonid Kostrykin and Karl Rohr, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods and results, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention using **six image datasets of five different cell types** for their experiments. I will look for specific names and details about these datasets.

In the **4.2 Datasets section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **NIH3T3 dataset**: This dataset consists of 49 Hoechst-stained images with a size of 1344 x 1024 pixels, including 2212 cell nuclei. The dataset is challenging due to strong auto-fluorescence artifacts and closely clustered nuclei.

2. **U2OS dataset**: This dataset consists of 48 images of U2OS cells stained with Hoechst 33342, with a size of 1349 x 1030 pixels, including 1836 cell nuclei. The dataset presents challenges due to non-elliptical shapes and clustering.

3. **GOWT1 datasets**: Two datasets of GFP-transfected mouse embryonic stem cells from the IEEE ISBI Cell Tracking Challenge training data, consisting of temporal image sequences with sizes of 1024 x 1024 pixels. The first dataset has 31 images with 150 cell nuclei, and the second has 20 images with 128 cell nuclei.

4. **Fibroblast dataset**: This dataset contains 175 3-D stacks of DAPI-stained images of human Fibroblast cells, with a total of 985 cell nuclei.

5. **HeLa dataset**: This dataset includes 25 DAPI-stained HeLa images, containing 282 cell nuclei, with each image sized 1200 x 1620 pixels.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to retrieve the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. This will allow me to compile a comprehensive list of datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for future reference.
