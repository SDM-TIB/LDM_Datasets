To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Orwellian-times at SemEval-2019 Task 4: A Stylistic and Content-based Classifier" by JÃ¼rgen Knauth, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a classification system for hyperpartisan news detection, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the SemEval2019 Hyperpartisan News Detection Task, which is a strong indicator that specific datasets were used for this task. The section titled **1.2 The Dataset** explicitly outlines the datasets provided by the task organizers.

Next, I will summarize the datasets mentioned in this section:

1. **Training Set**: A set of 600,000 articles for training, classified by the publisher's general orientation.
2. **Validation Set**: A set of 150,000 articles for validation, also classified by the publisher's general orientation.
3. **Crowdsourced Training Set**: 645 training articles that were classified individually by humans using a crowdsourcing approach.
4. **Hidden Validation Set (by publisher)**: A validation set classified by publisher, with an unknown size as it was hidden during the task.
5. **Hidden Validation Set (by individual)**: Another validation set classified individually, also with an unknown size.

The paper notes that all data is provided in a proprietary XML format, which is important for understanding how to access and utilize the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are part of the SemEval2019 task. Instead, I will cite the task paper that describes the datasets:

- For the SemEval2019 Hyperpartisan News Detection Task, the citation is:
  > Johannes Kiesel, Maria Mestre, Rishabh Shukla, Emmanuel Vincent, Payam Adineh, David Corney, Benno Stein, and Martin Potthast. *SemEval-2019 Task 4: Hyperpartisan News Detection*. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2019). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since the datasets are part of a shared task, referencing the task paper is appropriate for providing context about the datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names and their corresponding citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant information for future reference or processing.
