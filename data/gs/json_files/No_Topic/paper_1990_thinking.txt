To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Low Power, Fully Event-Based Gesture Recognition System" by Arnon Amir et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors present a new dataset called **DvsGesture**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The introduction mentions the need for DVS datasets and highlights the creation of the **DvsGesture** dataset, which includes timestamped DVS128 event files, RGB videos, and ground-truth files with gesture labels.

I will then focus on the **experiments** section, specifically **section 5.1 (Dataset collection)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the **DvsGesture** dataset. They mention that it comprises 1,342 instances of 11 hand and arm gestures collected from 29 subjects under three different lighting conditions. This section confirms the dataset's structure and the context in which it was collected.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section**. However, since the dataset is newly created by the authors, it may not have a separate citation in the references. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper itself.

The citation for the **DvsGesture** dataset will be constructed as follows:
> Amir, A., Taba, B., Berg, D., Melano, T., McKinstry, J., Di Nolfo, C., Nayak, T., Andreopoulos, A., Garreau, G., Mendoza, M., Kusnitz, J., Debole, M., Esser, S., Delbruck, T., Flickner, M., & Modha, D. (Year). *A Low Power, Fully Event-Based Gesture Recognition System*. IBM Research. Available at: http://research.ibm.com/dvsgesture/

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes ensuring that the dataset name, description, and citation are clearly articulated for any future reference or processing.
