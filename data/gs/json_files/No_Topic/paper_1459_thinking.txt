To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Linguistically Informed Convolutional Neural Network" by Sebastian Ebert et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of a linguistically informed CNN for sentiment analysis, which suggests that datasets related to sentiment classification may be involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results section** (section 5) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention using the **SemEval 2013** and **SemEval 2015** datasets for training and evaluation. They also reference the **Sentiment140** dataset, which is used to test the generality of their findings.

I will note the specific details provided about each dataset:

1. **SemEval 2013 Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and development, and the authors mention that it contains labeled examples for sentiment analysis tasks.

2. **SemEval 2015 Dataset**: This dataset is used for final evaluation, and it is part of the SemEval shared task on sentiment analysis in Twitter.

3. **Sentiment140 Dataset**: This dataset contains tweets labeled with sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral) and is used to evaluate the model's performance on a manually labeled test set.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **SemEval 2013 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Preslav Nakov, Sara Rosenthal, Zornitsa Kozareva, Veselin Stoyanov, Alan Ritter, and Theresa Wilson. *SemEval-2013 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter*. In SemEval, 2013.

- For the **SemEval 2015 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sara Rosenthal, Preslav Nakov, Svetlana Kiritchenko, Saif M. Mohammad, Alan Ritter, and Veselin Stoyanov. *SemEval-2015 Task 10: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter*. In SemEval, 2015.

- For the **Sentiment140 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alec Go, Richa Bhayani, and Lei Huang. *Twitter Sentiment Classification using Distant Supervision*. 2009.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
