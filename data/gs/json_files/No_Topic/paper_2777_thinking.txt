To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrating Language and Vision to Generate Natural Language Descriptions of Videos in the Wild" by Jesse Thomason et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and it may mention the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Approach)**, where the authors describe their methodology in detail. In this section, they mention using a video dataset collected by Chen and Dolan (2011). This is a strong indication that a specific dataset is being utilized.

In **subsection 3.1 (Video Dataset)**, the authors provide details about the dataset: it contains 1,967 short YouTube video clips paired with multiple human-generated natural-language descriptions. They specify that they used 1,297 videos for training and 670 for testing. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The citation for the dataset collected by Chen and Dolan (2011) is as follows:
> David L. Chen and William B. Dolan. *Collecting highly parallel data for paraphrase evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies-Volume 1, pages 190â€“200, 2011.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about it.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent analysis or usage of the dataset.
