To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Multi-Player Bandits - a Game of Thrones Approach" by Ilai Bistritz and Amir Leshem, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the multi-player multi-armed bandit problem and its applications, but again, there are no specific datasets mentioned. I will continue to the **methodology and experiments sections** to look for any datasets used in their simulations or analyses.

Upon reaching the **numerical simulations and practical considerations section**, I find that the authors describe a simulation setup where they generate rewards for players based on a uniform distribution. However, they do not reference any external datasets or benchmarks. Instead, they create their own simulated data for the experiments.

Since the paper does not cite any external datasets or provide specific datasets used in their experiments, I will note that the authors used a simulated dataset generated from a uniform distribution in the range [0.05, 0.95] for the expected rewards, and the rewards are generated with added noise from a uniform distribution on [-0.05, 0.05].

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are mentioned there. However, the references primarily consist of related works and do not include datasets. 

Given this analysis, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Simulated Dataset**: The authors generated their own dataset for the experiments, which consists of expected rewards chosen independently and uniformly at random in the range [0.05, 0.95]. The rewards are generated as rn,i(t) = Âµn,i + zn,i(t), where zn,i(t) are independent and uniformly distributed on [-0.05, 0.05].

Since there are no external datasets cited in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as typically required. Instead, I will document the simulated dataset description clearly.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
