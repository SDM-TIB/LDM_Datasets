To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Search-Oriented Conversational AI" presented at the EMNLP 2018 Workshop, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used. If the authors refer to specific datasets or data sources, I will note them down.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly focusing on sections that discuss methodologies, experiments, or evaluations. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

I will also check the **conclusion and future work sections** to see if the authors discuss any datasets that were not previously mentioned or suggest datasets for future research.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the **Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus**, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, C., & Lee, L. (2011). *Chameleons in Imagined Conversations: A New Approach to the Study of Dialogue*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (ACL-HLT 2011), pages 76-81.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is essential for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to explore the datasets further.
