To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Read and Comprehend by Gated-Attention Reader with More Belief" by Haohui Deng and Yik-Cheung Tam, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on public test sets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, they describe the datasets as follows:

1. **CNN and Daily Mail**: These datasets are used for evaluating their approaches. The authors reference the work by Hermann et al. (2015) for these datasets, indicating that they are well-known in the reading comprehension community.

2. **Who Did What (WDW)**: This dataset was constructed from the LDC English Gigaword newswire corpus and is mentioned as having two versions: a smaller "strict" version and a larger "relaxed" version. The authors cite Onishi et al. (2016) for this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CNN and Daily Mail**, the citation is:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 1693â€“1701, 2015.

- For **Who Did What (WDW)**, the citation is:
  > Takeshi Onishi, Hai Wang, Mohit Bansal, Kevin Gimpel, and David McAllester. *Who did what: A large-scale person-centered cloze dataset*. In Proceedings of the Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2016.

With these citations, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper. I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper attribution.
