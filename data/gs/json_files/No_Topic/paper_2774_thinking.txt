To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structure-from-Motion Revisited" by Johannes L. SchÃ¶nberger and Jan-Michael Frahm, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on a variety of challenging datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. They mention that they ran experiments on **17 datasets** containing a total of **144,953 unordered Internet photos**. This is a significant clue that I need to gather more specific information about these datasets.

I will look for any specific dataset names mentioned in the text, particularly in the context of the experiments. The authors list several datasets, including:

1. **Rome Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of building a 3D model from unordered images.
2. **Quad Dataset**: This dataset is noted for having ground-truth camera locations.
3. **Dubrovnik Dataset**: Mentioned in relation to triangulation statistics.
4. **Various other datasets**: The authors reference datasets such as Alamo, Ellis Island, Gendarmenmarkt, and others, which are used in their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, I will look for citations like:
- For the **Rome Dataset**, the citation might be:
  > S. Agarwal et al. "Building Rome in a Day." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2009.

- For the **Quad Dataset**, the citation could be:
  > J.-M. Frahm et al. "Building Rome on a Cloudless Day." In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2010.

- For the **Dubrovnik Dataset**, the citation might be:
  > Y. Li et al. "Location Recognition Using Prioritized Feature Matching." In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2010.

Once I have gathered all the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and properly formatted, ready for any further processing or review.
