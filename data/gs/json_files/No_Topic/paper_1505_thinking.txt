To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training MRF-Based Phrase Translation Models using Gradient Ascent" by Jianfeng Gao and Xiaodong He, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluation on **two Europarl translation tasks**, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they conducted experiments on two Europarl translation tasks: **German-English (DE-EN)** and **French-English (FR-EN)**. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including the number of sentence pairs and any other relevant characteristics.

In Section 4.1, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:
- For the **DE-EN** task, they state that the training set contains **751K sentence pairs**.
- For the **FR-EN** task, the training set contains **688K sentence pairs**.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The Europarl datasets are commonly referenced in the context of machine translation, and I will look for the appropriate citation.

The citation for the Europarl dataset is:
> Koehn, P., and Monz, C. 2006. Manual and automatic evaluation of machine translation between European languages. In Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pp. 102-121.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:
1. **Europarl German-English Dataset**: Contains 751K sentence pairs for the DE-EN translation task.
2. **Europarl French-English Dataset**: Contains 688K sentence pairs for the FR-EN translation task.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation.
