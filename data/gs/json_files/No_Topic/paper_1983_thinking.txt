To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FII_CROSS at SemEval-2021 Task 2: Multilingual and Cross-lingual Word-in-Context Disambiguation" by Ciprian Bodnar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used datasets from SemEval 2021 Task 2, which suggests that there are specific datasets relevant to their work.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets and Methods)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for the task. They mention that the dataset is released in JSON format and is divided into training, development, and test subsets for multilingual and cross-lingual settings. The section includes a table (Table 1) that outlines the corpus statistics for different languages, including Arabic, Chinese, English, French, and Russian.

The dataset is described as follows:
- It contains a total of 20,000 words for Arabic, 16,000 for Chinese, 24,500 for English, 22,000 for French, and 20,000 for Russian.
- The training and testing splits are also detailed, with specific numbers of training and testing words for each language.

The authors reference the task description paper for the dataset, which is crucial for obtaining the full citation. I will look for this reference in the **References section** of the paper.

The relevant citation for the dataset is:
> Martelli, F., Kalach, N., Tola, G., & Navigli, R. (2021). SemEval-2021 Task 2: Multilingual and Cross-lingual Word-in-Context Disambiguation (MCL-WiC). In Proceedings of the 15th Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2021.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. The dataset entry will include the name of the dataset, a brief description, and the citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
