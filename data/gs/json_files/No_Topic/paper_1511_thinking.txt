To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Construction of English-French Multimodal Affective Conversational Corpus from TV Dramas" by Sashi Novitasari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a multimodal affective conversational corpus based on TV dramas, which suggests that a dataset is indeed being constructed.

Next, I will examine the **Corpus Construction** section, particularly **3.1 (TV-Series Data Resources)**, where the authors describe the resources used for constructing the corpus. They mention using 40 episodes of American TV dramas, which provides a clear indication of the dataset's source.

In this section, I will note the details about the corpus, including the total number of utterances (25,663) and the types of data included (parallel text subtitles, speech audio, and video images). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and content.

I will also look for any specific names or titles associated with the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific name for the corpus, but they refer to it as a "multimodal affective conversational corpus," which I will use as a descriptor.

Next, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets mentioned. While the authors do not cite a specific dataset in the traditional sense, they reference various works that may have influenced their corpus construction. However, the primary dataset is the one they constructed themselves, so I will focus on that.

The authors mention that their corpus can be utilized for various tasks, which further emphasizes its significance in the field of multimodal and multilingual affective conversation research.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself as the source of the dataset. The citation for the paper is:

> Novitasari, S., Do, Q. T., Sakti, S., Lestari, D., & Nakamura, S. (2023). Construction of English-French Multimodal Affective Conversational Corpus from TV Dramas. *Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology*.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information, including its name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
