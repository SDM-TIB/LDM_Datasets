To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Authorship Identification for Literary Book Recommendations" by Haifa Alharthi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the evaluation of a book recommendation system, which suggests that datasets related to books and user ratings may be involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Evaluation)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Dataset and Preprocessing)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they refer to the **LitRec dataset**, which is described as containing data on 1,927 users who rated 3,710 literary works, incorporating data from Goodreads and Project Gutenberg.

I will also note any additional details provided about the dataset, such as its structure and the preprocessing steps taken. The authors mention that the dataset includes complete texts of books labeled with part-of-speech tags and that they filtered out zero-rated books and users with fewer than 10 ratings.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LitRec dataset. The authors cite the dataset as follows:

- **LitRec Dataset**: 
  > Paula Cristina Vaz, Ricardo Ribeiro, and David Martins de Matos. *LitRec vs. Movielens – A Comparative Study*. In KDIR 2012 – Proc. International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval, pages 370–373, 2012.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and ready for any further processing or review.
