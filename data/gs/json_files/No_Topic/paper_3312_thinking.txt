To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Learning of Motion-Informed Latents," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **Objectron** and **UCF101** datasets for their experiments, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about these datasets. The introduction reiterates the use of **Objectron** and **UCF101**, confirming their importance in the study.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, specifically **section 3.3 (Studied Video Datasets)**, I will find detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **Objectron**: This dataset contains 14,819 videos annotated with 3D bounding boxes over unique objects, categorized into nine different types (e.g., bikes, books, bottles). The dataset is designed for 3D object detection and localization tasks.

2. **UCF101**: This dataset consists of 13,320 videos annotated with 101 action labels, covering a wide range of human activities. It is less object-centric and focuses more on human-centric actions.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using these datasets for various tasks, which further confirms their relevance.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Objectron**, the citation is:
  > Adel Ahmadyan, Liangkai Zhang, Jianing Wei, Artsiom Ablavatski, and Matthias Grundmann. *Objectron: A large scale dataset of object-centric videos in the wild with pose annotations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.09988, 2020.

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
