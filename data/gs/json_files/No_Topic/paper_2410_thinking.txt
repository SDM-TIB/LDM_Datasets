To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cluster Labeling by Word Embeddings and WordNet’s Hypernymy" by Hanieh Poostchi and Massimo Piccardi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were conducted using the **WebAP document dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for more details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors mention that the **WebAP dataset** contains 6,399 documents and 1,959,777 sentences. This provides a good overview of the dataset's scale and nature.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WebAP dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> M. Keikha, J. H. Park, W. B. Croft, and M. Sanderson. *Retrieving Passages and Finding Answers*. In Proceedings of the 2014 Australasian Document Computing Symposium (ADCS), pages 81–84.

Since the paper primarily discusses the WebAP dataset and does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on this dataset for extraction.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper referencing.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the WebAP dataset, ready for further processing or review.
