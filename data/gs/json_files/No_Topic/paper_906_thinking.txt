To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Relationship between Visual Attributes and Convolutional Networks" by Victor Escorcia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "extensive experiments" and references "a conv-net that is pre-trained to recognize objects in images," which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or dataset names.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention using the **ImageNet-Attribute dataset**, which is a subset of the larger ImageNet dataset. The authors state that this dataset comprises 9600 images labeled with 25 binary attributes, which is crucial information for my extraction.

In the **approach section** (Section 2), the authors provide further details about the dataset used for their experiments. They clarify that the conv-net was trained on the **ILSVRC-12 dataset**, which is a well-known subset of ImageNet containing 1.2 million images across 1000 object classes. This information is also essential for my dataset extraction.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ImageNet-Attribute dataset**, the citation is:
   > O. Russakovsky and L. Fei-Fei. *Attribute learning in large-scale datasets*. In European Conference of Computer Vision (ECCV), International Workshop on Parts and Attributes, 2010.

2. For the **ILSVRC-12 dataset**, the citation is:
   > O. Russakovsky, J. Deng, H. Su, J. Krause, S. Satheesh, S. Ma, Z. Huang, A. Karpathy, A. Khosla, M. Bernstein, A. C. Berg, and L. Fei-Fei. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
