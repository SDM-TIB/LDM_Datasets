To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Relation Extraction from a Cultural Database" by Canasai Kruengkrai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors successfully applied their approach to a cultural database, which suggests that this database is a key dataset used in their research. The introduction further elaborates that the cultural database is derived from the Thai Cultural Information Center website and contains around 80,000 records. This indicates that the cultural database is significant for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, such as **section 2 (Approach)** and **section 3 (Experiments)**. In these sections, the authors describe their methodology and the results of their experiments, but they do not explicitly list multiple datasets. Instead, they focus on the cultural database as the primary source for extracting relation instances.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the cultural database. However, the paper does not provide a separate citation for the cultural database itself, as it is derived from the Thai Cultural Information Center website. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is based on publicly available records from this website.

The relevant dataset I will document is:

1. **Cultural Database**: This dataset consists of approximately 80,000 records from the Thai Cultural Information Center, which includes various cultural objects and their descriptions.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the cultural database, I will reference the source as follows:
> Thai Cultural Information Center. *Cultural Database*. Available at: http://m-culture.in.th/

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

After completing this process, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
