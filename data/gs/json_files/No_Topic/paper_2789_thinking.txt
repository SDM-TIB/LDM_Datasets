To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Modality and Component Aware Feature Fusion for RGB-D Scene Classification" by Anran Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions achieving state-of-the-art performance on the **SUNRGBD Dataset** and **NYU Depth Dataset V2**, indicating that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5.1, the authors provide a detailed description of the **SUNRGBD Dataset**. They mention that it consists of 10,335 RGB-D scene images across 19 scene categories, including images from various sources like Kinect and Intel RealSense. The authors also specify the training and testing splits, which is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

For the **NYU Depth Dataset V2**, the authors describe it in the same section, noting that it contains 1,449 images across 27 scene categories, which are reorganized into 10 categories for their experiments. They also mention the training and testing splits used in their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **SUNRGBD Dataset**:
   > Song, S., Lichtenberg, S. P., & Xiao, J. (2015). SUN RGB-D: A RGB-D scene understanding benchmark suite. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 567–576.

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
