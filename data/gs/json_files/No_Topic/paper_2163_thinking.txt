To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stacked Ensembles of Information Extractors for Knowledge-Base Population" by Nazneen Fatema Rajani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present results on the KBP-ESF task, which suggests that datasets related to this task may be discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **Common Systems Dataset**: This dataset consists of one run for every team that participated in both the 2013 and 2014 competitions, totaling 10 common teams. This dataset is crucial for evaluating their stacking approach.

2. **All 2014 SFV Systems Dataset**: This dataset includes all runs from the 17 teams that participated in the 2014 competition, totaling 65 systems. This dataset is used to compare the performance of their stacking method against various baselines.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for their methods on these datasets, confirming their significance in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are derived from the KBP competitions, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the relevant papers or reports associated with the KBP tasks:

- For the **Common Systems Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Surdeanu, M. (2013). Overview of the TAC2013 knowledge base population evaluation: English slot filling and temporal slot filling. In Proceedings of the Sixth Text Analysis Conference (TAC 2013).

- For the **All 2014 SFV Systems Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Surdeanu, M., & Ji, H. (2014). Overview of the English slot filling track at the TAC2014 Knowledge Base Population Evaluation. In Proceedings of the Seventh Text Analysis Conference (TAC2014).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
