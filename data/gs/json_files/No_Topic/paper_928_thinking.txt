To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Framework of Semantic Role Assignment based on Extended Lexical Conceptual Structure: Comparison with VerbNet and FrameNet" by Yuichiroh Matsubayashi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the limitations of existing semantic role labeling frameworks but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **related works section** and the **empirical data analysis** sections. The authors mention collecting empirical data for 60 Japanese verbs, which suggests that there may be a dataset associated with this collection. I will look for any specific names or references to this dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors provide statistics about the constructed dictionary of LCS structures for the 60 Japanese verbs. They mention that they consulted the Kyoto University Text Corpus (KTC) and the Digital Daijisen online dictionary. This indicates that these resources may be relevant datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Kyoto University Text Corpus (KTC)**: The citation is:
   > Sadao Kurohashi and Makoto Nagao. *Kyoto University Text Corpus Project*. Proceedings of the Annual Conference of JSAI, 11:58â€“61, 1997.

2. **Digital Daijisen**: This is an online dictionary, and while it may not have a formal citation like a traditional dataset, I can reference it as:
   > Digital Daijisen. Available at: http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/jn/.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified:

- **Kyoto University Text Corpus (KTC)**: A corpus used for semantic role labeling research, containing a variety of Japanese verbs.
- **Digital Daijisen**: An online Japanese dictionary used to supplement the analysis of verbs.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
