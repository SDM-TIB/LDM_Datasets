To extract datasets from the research paper titled "I Feel Offended, Don’t Be Abusive! Implicit/Explicit Messages in Offensive and Abusive Language" by Tommaso Caselli et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the creation of a new resource called **AbuseEval v1.0**, which indicates that there is a dataset involved. The introduction also references the **OLID/OffensEval** dataset, which is crucial for understanding the context of the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly the **Datasets** or **Methodology** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss the **OLID/OffensEval** dataset in detail, explaining its structure and the annotation process. They also introduce **AbuseEval v1.0**, which is derived from OLID/OffensEval but includes additional annotations for explicit and implicit abusive language.

In the **section 4.1 (The AbuseEval Data Set)**, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the **AbuseEval v1.0** dataset, including its purpose and the distinctions made between explicit and implicit abusive language. They also mention the number of messages in each category, which is important for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations are as follows:

1. **OLID/OffensEval Dataset**:
   > Zampieri, M., Malmasi, S., Nakov, P., Rosenthal, S., Farra, N., & Kumar, R. (2019). Predicting the Type and Target of Offensive Posts in Social Media. In Proceedings of NAACL.

2. **AbuseEval v1.0**:
   > Caselli, T., Basile, V., Mitrović, J., Kartoziya, I., & Granitzer, M. (2020). I Feel Offended, Don’t Be Abusive! Implicit/Explicit Messages in Offensive and Abusive Language. In Proceedings of the 12th Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2020), pages 6193–6202.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
