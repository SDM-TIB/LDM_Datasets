To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Population Matching Discrepancy and Applications in Deep Learning" by Jianfei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments and applications**. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I need to focus on sections that explicitly mention datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of estimating statistical divergence between distributions, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are likely to be detailed.

In **section 4 (Applications)**, the authors describe two main applications: **domain adaptation** and **deep generative modeling**. They mention using datasets for these applications, but I need to find the specific names and details of the datasets used.

In **section 5 (Experiments)**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **Office Dataset**: This dataset is used for domain adaptation tasks and contains three domains: Amazon, DSLR, and Webcam. The authors report accuracy results for various methods on this dataset.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is used for image generation tasks. It consists of handwritten digits and is a standard benchmark in machine learning.

3. **SVHN Dataset**: The Street View House Numbers dataset is also used for image generation tasks. It contains images of house numbers collected from Google Street View.

4. **LFW Dataset**: The Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset is used for image generation tasks. It contains images of faces collected from the web.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Office Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kate Saenko, Brian Kulis, Mario Fritz, and Trevor Darrell. *Adapting visual category models to new domains*. Computer Vision–ECCV 2010, pages 213–226, 2010.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **SVHN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, volume 2011, page 5, 2011.

- For the **LFW Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gary B. Huang, Manu Ramesh, Tamara Berg, and Erik Learned-Miller. *Labeled faces in the wild: A database for studying face recognition in unconstrained environments*. Technical Report 07-49, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, October 2007.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
