To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Identification of Participant Slots in Contracts" by Dan Simonson, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses a technique for identifying participant slots in contracts, but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction provides context about contracts but does not specify any datasets either.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Data)**, which is likely to contain information about the datasets used for the study. In **subsection 3.1 (Annotation)**, the author describes the annotation process for two types of contracts: NDAs and Services agreements. This indicates that the data used for the experiments consists of annotated contracts, but specific dataset names are not provided.

In **subsection 3.1**, the author mentions that the annotation team completed 712 NDAs and 214 Services agreements. However, these are not formal datasets with specific citations; they are rather the types of documents used in the study.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references primarily consist of related works and prior research, but they do not provide specific datasets that were used in this paper.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets or provide citations for them, I conclude that the datasets used are proprietary or not formally published. Therefore, I will note that while the paper discusses the use of annotated NDAs and Services agreements, it does not provide specific dataset names or citations.

In summary, I will document the following:

1. **Annotated NDAs**: 712 NDAs were annotated for the study, but no formal citation is provided.
2. **Annotated Services Agreements**: 214 Services agreements were annotated, but again, no formal citation is provided.

Since there are no formal datasets with citations, I will indicate that the datasets are not publicly available or cited in the paper.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
