To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PanoRecon: Real-Time Panoptic 3D Reconstruction from Monocular Video" by Dong Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **ScanNetV2**, which suggests that this dataset is likely used in their evaluations. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of 3D scene understanding and mentions the use of datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly state in **section 4.1 (Dataset, Metrics and Baseline)** that they performed their experiments on **ScanNetV2**. They describe the dataset as consisting of 1613 scans across 807 distinct scenes, which includes RGB images, ground truth depths, camera poses, surface reconstructions, and instance-level semantic segmentations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **ScanNetV2** dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Angela Dai, Angel X Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5828–5839, 2017.

Since **ScanNetV2** is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format. 

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as specified. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
