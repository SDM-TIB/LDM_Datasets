To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Painless Labeling with Application to Text Mining" by Sajib Dasgupta, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the creation of labeled resources for categorical data, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the author explicitly mentions three text classification tasks. Here, I will look for the datasets used for each task:

1. **Gender Classification**: The paper states that the authors used a blog dataset introduced by Schler et al. (2006), which contains 19,320 blog articles, but they selected 5,000 articles for their experiments.

2. **Spam Classification**: The authors mention using the Enron spam dataset as introduced by Metsis et al. (2006), combining sections of spam and ham emails, and also selecting 5,000 emails for their dataset.

3. **Sentiment Classification**: For this task, the authors refer to Pang et al.’s movie review dataset (Pang et al., 2002), which consists of 2,000 reviews annotated with sentiment labels.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **blog dataset** used in gender classification, the citation is:
  > Schler, J., Koppel, M., Argamon, S., & Pennebaker, J. (2006). Effects of age and gender in blogging. In AAAI Symposium on Computational Approaches for Analyzing Weblogs.

- For the **Enron spam dataset**, the citation is:
  > Metsis, V., Androutsopoulos, I., & Paliouras, G. (2006). Spam filtering with naive bayes - which naive bayes? In 3rd Conference on Email and Anti-Spam (CEAS).

- For the **Pang et al.’s movie review dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pang, B., Lee, L., & Vaithyanathan, S. (2002). Thumbs up? Sentiment classification using machine learning techniques. In Proceedings of Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
