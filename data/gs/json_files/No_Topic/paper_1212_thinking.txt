To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Factoring Ambiguity out of the Prediction of Compositionality for German Multi-Word Expressions" by Stefan Bott and Sabine Schulte im Walde, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, but I will focus on the introduction and methodology for detailed descriptions.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of predicting compositionality for German multi-word expressions (MWEs) and mention that they utilize gold standards for their experiments. This indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention two gold standards used in their research:

1. **GS-NN (Gold Standard for Noun-Noun Compounds)**: This dataset consists of 868 German noun-noun compounds that were annotated by native speakers for compositionality. The compounds were selected from various frequency ranges and ambiguity levels.

2. **GS-PV (Gold Standard for Particle Verbs)**: This dataset includes 354 German particle verbs, which were also annotated for compositionality. The verbs were selected from different frequency bands and underwent some manual revision to ensure accuracy.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For **GS-NN**, the citation is:
  > Schulte im Walde, Sabine, and Bott, Stefan. *Ghost-NN: A representative gold standard of German noun-noun compounds*. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’16), pages 2285–2292, Portoroz, Slovenia, 2016. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

- For **GS-PV**, the citation is:
  > Bott, Stefan, and Schulte im Walde, Sabine. *Ghost-PV: A representative gold standard of German particle verbs*. In Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of the Lexicon (CogALex - V), pages 125–133, Osaka, Japan, 2016. The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee.

With the datasets and their citations identified, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and provided proper citations for each.
