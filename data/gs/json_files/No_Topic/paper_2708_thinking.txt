To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using subcategorization knowledge to improve case prediction for translation to German" by Marion Weller et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using a hierarchical translation system and refer to the corpora used for extracting subcategorization tuples, specifically **Europarl** and **HGC (Huge German Corpus)**. 

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail that they used **1,485,059 parallel sentences** for training, which is crucial information for understanding the scale of their dataset. They also mention that the German part of the Europarl corpus was dependency-parsed, which indicates that this dataset is integral to their methodology.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Europarl Corpus**:
   > Philipp Koehn. *Europarl: A Parallel Corpus for Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the 10th Machine Translation Summit, pages 79–86, 2005.

2. **HGC (Huge German Corpus)**:
   > Helmut Schmid. *LoPar: Design and Implementation*. Arbeitspapiere des Sonderforschungsbereichs 340 ‘Linguistic Theory and the Foundations of Computational Linguistics’ 149, Institut für Maschinelle Sprachverarbeitung, Universität Stuttgart, 2000.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
