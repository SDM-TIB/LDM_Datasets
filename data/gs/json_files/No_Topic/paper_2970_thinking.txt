To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Glyph2Vec: Learning Chinese Out-of-Vocabulary Word Embedding from Glyphs" by Hong-You Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors tackle the problem of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in Chinese NLP applications, which suggests that they may have used specific datasets for their experiments. The introduction provides context about the challenges faced in Chinese NLP, but I need to look for explicit mentions of datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Setup)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **Sinica Corpus**, which is a significant dataset for their work. I will note down the details provided about this dataset.

In **subsection 5.2 (Wikipedia Title Classification)**, the authors refer to a dataset comprising **593K Chinese articles from Wikipedia**, which they categorize into 12 classes based on their titles. This is another dataset that I need to document.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Sinica Corpus**, the citation is:
   > Sinica Corpus. *Sinica Corpus 4.0*. Available at: http://asbc.iis.sinica.edu.tw/indexreadme.htm

2. For the **Wikipedia Title dataset**, the citation is:
   > Frederick Liu, Han Lu, Chieh Lo, and Graham Neubig. *Learning character-level compositionality with visual features*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 2059â€“2068, 2017. Available at: https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will allow for accurate representation and referencing in any subsequent analysis or application.
