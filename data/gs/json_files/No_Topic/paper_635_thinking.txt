To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Flexible Spatio-Temporal Networks for Video Prediction" by Chaochao Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on several challenging public datasets," which indicates that datasets are used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **UCF101**: This dataset contains 13,320 videos with an average length of 6.2 seconds from 101 different action categories. It is a well-known benchmark for action recognition in videos.

2. **Sports1m**: This dataset consists of 1 million YouTube clips, and the authors used a subset of 600 randomly selected videos for training their model.

3. **PV Dataset**: This dataset is derived from video sequences extracted from the PROST and ViSOR sets. The authors used a subset consisting of 11 video sequences for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402.

- For **Sports1m**, the citation is:
  > Karpathy, A., Toderici, G., Shetty, S., Leung, T., Sukthankar, R., & Fei-Fei, L. (2014). Large-scale video classification with convolutional neural networks. In CVPR.

- For **PV Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Santner, J., Leistner, C., Saffari, A., Pock, T., & Bischof, H. (2010). PROST: Parallel robust online simple tracking. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2010 IEEE Conference on, pages 723â€“730. IEEE.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
