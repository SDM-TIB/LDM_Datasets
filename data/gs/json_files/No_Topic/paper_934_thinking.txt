To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The benefit of syntactic vs. linear n-grams for linguistic description" by Melanie Andresen and Heike Zinsmeister, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of dependency annotations for linguistic description, which suggests that datasets related to dependency annotations might be present.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Study: Disciplinary differences in academic writing style)**, where the authors describe their study based on a corpus of 60 German PhD theses. This section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used.

In **subsection 5.1 (Data and preprocessing)**, the authors mention that the study is based on a corpus of 60 German PhD theses, with 30 from linguistics and 30 from literary studies. They describe the preprocessing steps taken to prepare the texts for analysis, which indicates that this corpus is a key dataset.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results and discussion sections**. However, the primary dataset appears to be the corpus of PhD theses.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. The authors reference several studies and datasets throughout the paper, but the main dataset is the corpus of PhD theses they created.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Andresen, M., & Zinsmeister, H. (2017). Approximating Style by n-Gram-based Annotation. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Stylistic Variation, Copenhagen, Denmark, September.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry based on the information gathered. The main dataset is the corpus of 60 German PhD theses, which is crucial for their analysis of linguistic styles in different academic disciplines.

After completing this process, I will ensure that the dataset entry is structured clearly and includes the full citation for the dataset, ready for further processing or review.
