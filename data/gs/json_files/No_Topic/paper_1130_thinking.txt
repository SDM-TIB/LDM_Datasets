To extract datasets from the SIGDIAL 2019 conference proceedings, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by scanning the **Table of Contents** to identify any papers that explicitly mention datasets in their titles or abstracts. This will help me focus on the most relevant sections of the proceedings.

Next, I will read through the **abstracts** of the papers listed in the Table of Contents. I will look for keywords such as "dataset," "data," "corpus," or "evaluation" that indicate the presence of datasets. If a paper mentions a dataset, I will take note of the paper's title and authors for later reference.

Once I identify papers that mention datasets, I will delve into the **main body of each paper**, particularly focusing on sections like the **Introduction**, **Methodology**, and **Experiments**. These sections often provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their size, structure, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

For example, I will look for sections that explicitly describe the datasets, such as "Dataset Description" or "Data Collection." Here, I will extract key details such as the name of the dataset, the number of samples, and any unique features that the authors highlight.

After gathering information about the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of each paper to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

For instance, if a paper mentions a dataset like "TDDiscourse," I will look for its citation in the References section, which might look something like this:
> Aakanksha Naik, Luke Breitfeller, and Carolyn Rose. *TDDiscourse: A Dataset for Discourse-Level Temporal Ordering of Events*. In Proceedings of the SIGDIAL 2019 Conference, pages 239-246, 2019.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will create a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the SIGDIAL 2019 proceedings.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the conference proceedings.
