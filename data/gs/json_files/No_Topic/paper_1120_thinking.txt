To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Social Media Posts as Knowledge Resource for Generating Life Stories" by Robee Khyra Mae J. Te et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of **social media posts**, specifically from Facebook, as a source for generating life stories, which indicates that the dataset is likely composed of user-generated posts.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Gathering Storytelling Knowledge)**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention gathering **21,412 social media posts from 216 user accounts**. This is a significant dataset, and I will note the details about its composition and the method of collection.

In this section, the authors also discuss the categorization of posts into four main categories: **Eating, Drinking, Travelling, and Celebrating**. They provide specific counts for each category, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure. The breakdown is as follows:
- **Eating**: 193 posts
- **Drinking**: 53 posts
- **Travelling**: 409 posts
- **Celebrating**: 643 posts

I will also look for any references to the ethical considerations taken during data collection, as this is important for understanding the dataset's integrity and the context in which it was gathered.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets or methodologies used. However, since the dataset primarily consists of user-generated content from Facebook, it may not have a formal citation like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the ethical guidelines and consent procedures mentioned in the paper, which are relevant to the dataset's usage.

The citation for the paper itself is:

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper and any relevant details about the dataset's composition and ethical considerations.
