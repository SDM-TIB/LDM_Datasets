To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural Language Generation from Pictographs" by Leen Sevens et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses a Pictograph-to-Text translation system, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction highlights the need for digital communication interfaces for people with Intellectual or Developmental Disabilities (IDD) but does not mention specific datasets.

Moving on to **section 4 (Pictograph input methods)**, I will look for any datasets used in the development or testing of the translation system. Here, the authors mention using a corpus of 69,636 email messages sent by users of the WAI-NOT communication platform, which is a significant dataset for their research.

In **section 5 (Natural Language Generation from Pictographs)**, the authors describe the training corpus used for their language model. They mention several datasets, including:

1. **Europarl**: A parallel corpus for statistical machine translation, which is widely used in the field.
2. **CGN (Corpus Gesproken Nederlands)**: A spoken Dutch corpus that provides data for language processing.
3. **CLEF (Cross-Language Evaluation Forum)**: A dataset used for evaluating cross-language systems.
4. **DGT-TM**: A translation memory dataset available in 22 languages.
5. **Wikipedia**: A well-known dataset that can be used for various natural language processing tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Europarl**, the citation is:
  > Philipp Koehn. *Europarl: A Parallel Corpus for Statistical Machine Translation*. In MT Summit-05, pages 79–86, 2005.

- For **CGN**, the citation is:
  > N. Oostdijk, W. Goedertier, F. Van Eynde, L. Boves, J. P. Martens, M. Moortgat, and H. Baayen. *Experiences from the Spoken Dutch Corpus Project*. In LREC-02, pages 340–347, 2003.

- For **CLEF**, the citation is:
  > C. Peters and M. Braschler. *European Research letter: Cross-language System Evaluation: the CLEF Campaigns*. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 52(12):1067–1072, 2001.

- For **DGT-TM**, the citation is:
  > R. Steinberger, A. Eisele, S. Klocek, S. Pilos, and P. Schlüter. *DGT-TM: A Freely Available Translation Memory in 22 Languages*. In LREC-12, pages 454–459, 2012.

- For **Wikipedia**, while it is a widely recognized dataset, it typically does not have a formal citation in the same way as other datasets. However, it can be referenced as:
  > Wikipedia contributors. *Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia*. Available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets relevant to the research presented in the paper.
