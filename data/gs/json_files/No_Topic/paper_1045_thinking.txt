To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Animacy Classification" by Samuel R. Bowman and Harshit Chopra, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the automatic annotation of noun phrases but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction references an annotated corpus used for training a classifier, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors mention using an "annotated corpus presented in that work," specifically referring to Zaenen et al. (2004). This indicates that the dataset is derived from their work, and I need to find the details of this corpus.

In **section 4 (Conclusion and future work)**, the authors mention the "animacy-annotated subset of the hand-parsed Switchboard corpus." This is a crucial piece of information as it identifies the specific dataset used in their research.

Now, I will gather the details about the dataset:

1. **Switchboard Corpus**: The paper indicates that the authors used an animacy-annotated subset of the Switchboard corpus, which consists of conversational American English. The dataset includes approximately 110,000 sentences with about 300,000 noun phrases (NPs), divided into training, development, and test sets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Switchboard corpus and any other relevant datasets mentioned. The citation for the Switchboard corpus is:

- For the **Switchboard Corpus**, the citation is:
  > S. Calhoun, J. Carletta, J.M. Brenier, N. Mayo, D. Jurafsky, M. Steedman, and D. Beaver. *The NXT-format Switchboard Corpus*. Language resources and evaluation, 44(4), 2010.

Since the paper primarily discusses the use of this specific dataset, I will focus on this entry for my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately represented for further processing or review.
