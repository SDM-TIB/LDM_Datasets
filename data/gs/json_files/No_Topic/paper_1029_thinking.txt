To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Representation Balancing Offline Model-Based Reinforcement Learning" by Byung-Jun Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method on benchmark offline RL tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention the D4RL benchmark (Fu et al., 2020) as a representative set of benchmark offline RL tasks. This indicates that the D4RL datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets. In section 5.2, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on a subset of datasets from the D4RL benchmark, which includes four types of datasets (Random, Medium, Medium-Replay, and Medium-Expert) across three different MuJoCo environments (HalfCheetah-v2, Hopper-v2, and Walker2d-v2).

I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **D4RL Benchmark**: This benchmark includes various datasets for offline reinforcement learning tasks. The specific datasets mentioned in the paper are:
   - **Walker2d-v2**: Contains datasets of different types (Random, Medium, Medium-Replay, Medium-Expert).
   - **Hopper-v2**: Also includes datasets of different types (Random, Medium, Medium-Replay, Medium-Expert).
   - **HalfCheetah-v2**: Similar to the others, it has datasets categorized as Random, Medium, Medium-Replay, and Medium-Expert.

Next, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets. The D4RL benchmark is cited as follows:
- For the D4RL benchmark:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and citation to ensure clarity and completeness.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
