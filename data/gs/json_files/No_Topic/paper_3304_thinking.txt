To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Collectively Representing Semi-Structured Data from the Web" by Bhavana Dalvi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on publicly available semi-structured datasets from the web, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss various tasks that utilize semi-structured data, but they do not specify any datasets yet. This section serves to set the context for the research but does not provide dataset names.

Moving on to **section 4 (Experiments)**, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation. The authors state that they use the **Delicious Sports**, **Toy Apple**, and **Hyponym Concept datasets** to evaluate their techniques. This is a crucial finding as it directly identifies the datasets utilized in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide some statistics about these datasets, which helps in understanding their characteristics. They mention that the datasets are publicly available and provide a reference to the source of these datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The relevant citations are:

- For the **Delicious Sports dataset**:
  > Dalvi, B., Cohen, W., and Callan, J. (2012). Websets: Extracting sets of entities from the web using unsupervised information extraction. In WSDM. http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/wk/WebSets/wsdm_2012_online/index.html.

- For the **Toy Apple dataset**:
  > Dalvi, B., Cohen, W., and Callan, J. (2012). Websets: Extracting sets of entities from the web using unsupervised information extraction. In WSDM. http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/wk/WebSets/wsdm_2012_online/index.html.

- For the **Hyponym Concept dataset**:
  > Carlson, A., Betteridge, J., Wang, R. C., Hruschka, Jr., E. R., and Mitchell, T. M. (2010). Coupled semi-supervised learning for information extraction. In WSDM. http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/rtw/.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Delicious Sports Dataset**: A dataset used for evaluating semi-structured data extraction techniques.
2. **Toy Apple Dataset**: Another dataset utilized for the same purpose, providing a different context for evaluation.
3. **Hyponym Concept Dataset**: A dataset that includes hyponym relationships, used in conjunction with the other datasets for various tasks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
