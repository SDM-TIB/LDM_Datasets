To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mildly Non-Projective Dependency Grammar" by Marco Kuhlmann, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Evaluation."** In this paper, I will focus on sections that discuss the evaluation of the proposed grammar formalism, as they are likely to mention the datasets used for testing.

Upon reviewing the paper, I will identify any datasets that are referenced. For instance, if the author mentions using specific dependency treebanks for evaluation, I will note their names and any relevant details provided about them.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture all necessary citation details, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **Prague Dependency Treebank**, I would look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Hajič, Jan, Otakar Smrž, Petr Zemánek, Jan Šnaidauf, and Emanuel Beška. *Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank: Development in data and tools*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Arabic Language Resources and Tools, pages 110–117, Cairo, 2004.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately represented each dataset's details, including any specific characteristics or features mentioned in the paper, such as the number of sentences, languages covered, or any unique annotations provided in the datasets.
