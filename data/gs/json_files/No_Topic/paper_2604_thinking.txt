To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A3-108 Machine Translation System for LoResMT Shared Task @MT Summit 2021 Conference" by Saumitra Yadav and Manish Shrivastava, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and while it mentions the creation of synthetic data, it does not specify any datasets directly.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, which discusses the methods used for machine translation and mentions the low-resource setting for the English-Marathi language pair. However, it does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then examine the **data section** (section 2.1) where the authors describe the datasets used. Here, they mention that the shared task organizers provided a parallel and monolingual corpus. They also detail the composition of the datasets, including the number of sentences for training and development sets for both English and Marathi.

The paper includes a **Table 1** that summarizes the dataset statistics, which is crucial for understanding the datasets used in their experiments. The table indicates the number of sentences in the monolingual and parallel datasets for both languages.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference several works related to the methodologies and tools they used, but they do not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves. Instead, I will note the relevant citations for the tools and methods they employed, as these may lead to the original datasets.

The relevant citations from the references include:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant citations for the tools and methods used, as they are essential for understanding the context of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that highlights the datasets used, their descriptions, and the full citations for reference.
