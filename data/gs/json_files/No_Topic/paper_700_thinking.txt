To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A MARVS Analysis of Two Chinese Near-Synonymous Verbs of Jumping Based on Chinese Corpora" by Yingying Peng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes two large Chinese corpora, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

In the **introduction**, the author mentions the two corpora explicitly: **GigaWord2** and the **CCL corpus**. This confirms that these are the datasets used for the analysis of the near-synonymous verbs.

Next, I will look into the **methods section** to gather more details about these datasets. The author describes the **CCL corpus** as containing 783,463,175 Chinese characters, extracted from both modern and classical Chinese. The **GigaWord2 corpus** is noted to have over 800 million PoS tagged words from various Mandarin Chinese varieties. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and application.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are important for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

For the **GigaWord2 corpus**, the citation is:
> Huang, C.-R. (2009). Tagged Chinese Gigaword version 2.0, ldc2009t14. Linguistic Data Consortium.

For the **CCL corpus**, the citation is:
> Zhan, W., Guo, R., Chang, B., Chen, Y., and Chen, L. (2019). The building of the CCL corpus: its design and implementation. Corp. Ling, 6:77–86.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **GigaWord2**: A large corpus containing over 800 million PoS tagged words from three varieties of Mandarin Chinese.
   - Citation: Huang, C.-R. (2009). Tagged Chinese Gigaword version 2.0, ldc2009t14. Linguistic Data Consortium.

2. **CCL corpus**: A corpus developed by the center for Chinese Linguistics of Beijing University, containing 783,463,175 Chinese characters from modern and classical Chinese.
   - Citation: Zhan, W., Guo, R., Chang, B., Chen, Y., and Chen, L. (2019). The building of the CCL corpus: its design and implementation. Corp. Ling, 6:77–86.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
