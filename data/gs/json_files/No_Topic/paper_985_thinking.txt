To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Debiasing Pretrained Text Encoders by Paying Attention to Paying Attention," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of a debiasing method on various social biases in NLP models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **related work and evaluation sections**. In the related work, the authors reference several benchmarks and datasets used for measuring bias in NLP models. Specifically, I will look for mentions of datasets like **StereoSet** and **Crows-Pairs**, which are highlighted as benchmarks for measuring stereotypes in text encoders.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention the datasets used for their evaluations. They specifically state that they used the **StereoSet** and **Crows-Pairs** datasets for likelihood-based evaluations. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and structure.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

1. **StereoSet**: The citation is:
   > Nadeem, M., Bethke, A., & Reddy, S. (2020). *Stereoset: Measuring stereotypical bias in pretrained language models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.09456.

2. **Crows-Pairs**: The citation is:
   > Nangia, N., Vania, C., Bhalerao, R., & Bowman, S. R. (n.d.). *Crows-Pairs: A challenge dataset for measuring social biases in masked language models*. 

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for understanding the context and validity of the experiments conducted.
