To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Based on BERT-DAOA" by Chen-Yu Chen and Chia-Hui Chang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, which is on sentiment analysis of singers on social media. However, it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **section titled "資料集準備與分析" (Dataset Preparation and Analysis)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors describe their dataset as being sourced from "批踢踢 PTT 實業坊" (PTT Bulletin Board System), specifically focusing on music-related discussions. They mention that they preprocessed the posts and used a singer dictionary to identify relevant paragraphs.

In this section, the authors also provide a statistical summary of the dataset in **表 1 (Table 1)**, which includes the number of sentences, classes, and distinct targets. This indicates that they have created a dataset specifically for aspect-based sentiment analysis.

Now, I will look for the **full citation of the dataset**. Since the dataset is derived from PTT, I will need to provide a citation that reflects this source. The citation should include the name of the platform, the nature of the data collected, and any relevant details about the dataset's creation.

The citation for the dataset can be structured as follows:
> Chen-Yu Chen and Chia-Hui Chang. *Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Based on BERT-DAOA*. Dataset from PTT Bulletin Board System, Taiwan. Data collected from music-related discussions, 2020.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear reference for anyone looking to understand the dataset used in this research.
