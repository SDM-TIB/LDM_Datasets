To extract datasets from the research paper titled "fokas: Formerly Known As - A Search Engine Incorporating Named Entity Evolution" by Helge Holzmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper uses the **New York Times corpus** to demonstrate the NEER method, which suggests that this corpus is a key dataset.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of named entity evolution and how their search engine, fokas, utilizes the NEER method. They mention the **New York Times corpus** again, emphasizing its suitability due to its long time span and the variety of topics covered.

In the **methodology section**, I will check for any additional details about the dataset. The authors describe how they analyze the New York Times corpus from 1986 to 2007, which confirms its relevance as a dataset for their experiments.

I will also review the **references section** to find the full citation for the New York Times corpus. However, it appears that the corpus itself is not attributed to a specific paper but is rather a well-known dataset used in various studies.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset:

1. **New York Times Corpus**: This dataset is used to demonstrate the NEER method and is characterized by its extensive time span (1986â€“2007) and diverse topics. It serves as a rich resource for analyzing named entity evolution.

Since the New York Times corpus is widely recognized, I will note that it does not have a specific citation in the references section of this paper. However, I can reference it as follows:

- **New York Times Corpus**: 
  > The New York Times. *The New York Times Archive*. Available online at https://www.nytimes.com.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format them according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the full citation for the New York Times corpus as part of the dataset entry.
