To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Flooding-X: Improving BERTâ€™s Resistance to Adversarial Attacks via Loss-Restricted Fine-Tuning" by Qin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of their method on various text classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. In this section, they mention five datasets for their experiments:

1. **SST (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and contains 67,000 training samples and 1,800 test samples, with an average word count of 19.

2. **MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus)**: This dataset consists of 3,700 training samples and 1,700 test samples, with an average word count of 44.

3. **QNLI (Question Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset has 105,000 training samples and 5,400 test samples, with an average word count of 37.

4. **IMDB (Internet Movie Database)**: This dataset contains 25,000 training samples and 7,600 test samples, with an average word count of 268.

5. **AG News**: This dataset includes 120,000 training samples and 40,000 test samples, with an average word count of 40.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
