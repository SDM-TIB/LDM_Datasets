To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using character overlap to improve language transformation" by Sander Wubben et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on translating Middle Dutch to Modern Dutch, which may hint at the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of data sparsity in the context of historical texts, which suggests that they may have utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

In the **data section (Section 5)**, the authors provide a detailed breakdown of the training data, which consists of various Middle Dutch literary works along with their modern Dutch translations. This section is crucial as it explicitly lists the datasets used in their study.

The datasets mentioned include:

1. **Van den vos Reynaerde**: A Middle Dutch literary work with 3,428 lines, dated around 1260.
2. **Sint Brandaan**: Another Middle Dutch work with 2,312 lines, originating from the 12th century.
3. **Gruuthuuse gedichten**: A collection of poems with 224 lines, dated around 1400.
4. **â€™t Prieel van Trojen**: A Middle Dutch text with 104 lines, from the 13th century.
5. **Various poems**: A collection of poems totaling 42 lines, from the 12th to 14th centuries.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are literary works, they may not have formal citations like datasets in other fields. Instead, I will provide the titles and relevant details as they appear in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full titles, line counts, and dates of origin for each dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each entry is clear and includes all necessary details for proper citation and reference.
