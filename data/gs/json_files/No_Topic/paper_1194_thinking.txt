To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UFAL at MRP 2020: Permutation-invariant Semantic Parsing in PERIN" by David Samuel and Milan Straka, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the CoNLL 2020 shared task, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention five different frameworks (AMR, DRG, EDS, PTG, and UCCA) that were part of the shared task. This implies that datasets corresponding to these frameworks were utilized, but I need to find specific dataset names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods section**. In this paper, the authors describe the frameworks used, but they do not explicitly list datasets. However, they reference the CoNLL 2020 shared task, which typically has associated datasets.

To find the full citations for the datasets, I will check the **references section** for any papers that describe the datasets used in the frameworks mentioned. The references to the frameworks provide clues about the datasets:

1. **AMR (Abstract Meaning Representation)**: The citation for the AMR dataset is:
   > Banarescu, L., Bonial, C., Cai, S., Georgescu, M., Grifﬁtt, K., Hermjakob, U., Knight, K., Koehn, P., Palmer, M., & Schneider, N. (2013). Abstract Meaning Representation for Sembanking. In Proceedings of the 7th Linguistic Annotation Workshop and Interoperability with Discourse, pages 178–186, Sofia, Bulgaria. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **DRG (Discourse Representation Graphs)**: The citation for the DRG dataset is:
   > Abzianidze, L., Bjerva, J., Evang, K., Haagsma, H., van Noord, R., Ludmann, P., Nguyen, D.-D., & Bos, J. (2017). The Parallel Meaning Bank: Towards a Multilingual Corpus of Translations Annotated with Compositional Meaning Representations. In Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Volume 2, Short Papers, pages 242–247, Valencia, Spain. Association for Computational Linguistics.

3. **EDS (Elementary Dependency Structures)**: The citation for the EDS dataset is:
   > Oepen, J., & Lønning, J. T. (2006). Discriminant-Based MRS Banking. In LREC, pages 1250–1255.

4. **PTG (Prague Tectogrammatical Graphs)**: The citation for the PTG dataset is:
   > Hajic, J., Hajicova, E., Panevova, J., Sgall, P., Bojar, O., Cinkova, S., Fucikova, E., Mikulova, M., Pajas, P., Popelka, J., et al. (2012). Announcing Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0. In LREC, pages 3153–3160.

5. **UCCA (Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation)**: The citation for the UCCA dataset is:
   > Abend, O., & Rappoport, A. (2013). Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA). In Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 228–238, Sofia, Bulgaria. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
