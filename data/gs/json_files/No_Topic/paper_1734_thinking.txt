To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentiable Ranks and Sorting using Optimal Transport" by Marco Cuturi, Olivier Teboul, and Jean-Philippe Vert, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in previous work or in the current study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments. 

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or their characteristics, as these often provide concise information about the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using datasets like "CIFAR-10" or "MNIST," I will look for their full citations in the references. If the datasets are not directly cited in the paper, I will search for authoritative sources or original papers that introduced these datasets to ensure accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methods sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed dataset information.
3. Check tables and figures for concise dataset summaries.
4. Retrieve full citations from the references or authoritative sources.
5. Compile the dataset information systematically for clarity.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
