To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ICARUS – An Extensible Graphical Search Tool for Dependency Treebanks" by Markus Gärtner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss the tool's functionality and examples**. The abstract mentions ICARUS as a tool for querying dependency treebanks, which suggests that it may utilize specific datasets for its functionality.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of linguistically annotated corpora for empirical linguistics and computational modeling. This indicates that the paper may reference specific datasets used for dependency treebanking.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **background section**. Here, the authors refer to various treebanks, including the **Prague Dependency Treebank** and **SynTagRus** for Russian. These are likely candidates for datasets used in conjunction with ICARUS.

I will also check the **examples section** for any specific datasets mentioned during the demonstration of ICARUS. The paper references the **CoNLL 2008 Shared Task data set**, which is significant for the context of dependency parsing.

After identifying these datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Prague Dependency Treebank**:
   > Jan Hajič, Alena Böhmová, Eva Hajičová, and Barbora Vidová-Hladká. *The Prague Dependency Treebank: A Three-Level Annotation Scenario*. In Treebanks: Building and Using Parsed Corpora, pages 103–127. Amsterdam: Kluwer, 2000.

2. **SynTagRus**:
   > Igor Boguslavsky, Svetlana Grigorieva, Nikolai Grigoriev, Leonid Kreidlin, and Nadezhda Frid. *Dependency Treebank for Russian: Concept, Tools, and Types of Information*. In COLING 2000, pages 987–991, Saarbrücken, Germany.

3. **CoNLL 2008 Shared Task data set**:
   > Mihai Surdeanu, Richard Johansson, Adam Meyers, Lluís Marquez, and Joakim Nivre. *The CoNLL 2008 Shared Task on Joint Parsing of Syntactic and Semantic Dependencies*. In CoNLL 2008, pages 159–177, Manchester, England.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into the required format for further processing or review. This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
