To extract datasets from the SemEval-2017 proceedings, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by scanning the **Table of Contents** to identify sections that likely contain dataset information. The tasks listed in the contents, such as "Semantic Textual Similarity," "Sentiment Analysis," and "Community Question Answering," suggest that datasets will be discussed in the corresponding task description papers.

Next, I will focus on the **task description papers** themselves. Each task description typically includes a section detailing the datasets used for that task. I will read through these sections carefully to extract the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant statistics or characteristics mentioned by the authors.

For example, I will look for phrases like "We used the following datasets for our experiments" or "The dataset consists of X samples," which indicate that a dataset is being described. I will also pay attention to any footnotes or references that might provide additional context or citations for the datasets.

Once I identify the datasets, I will compile the necessary details, including:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including the number of samples, types of data, and any specific features.
3. **Full Citation**: I will locate the full citation for each dataset in the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For instance, if I find that the "SemEval-2017 Task 1" used a dataset called "STS Benchmark," I will note its description and then find the citation, which might look like:
> Cer, D., Yang, Y., Kong, S., Hua, N., & Limtiaco, N. (2017). *Universal Sentence Encoder*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.11175.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will organize the datasets into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation for each dataset. This will ensure that the information is clear and accessible for future reference.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries.
