To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Robust Learning to Optimize with Theoretical Guarantees" by Qingyu Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in section 6, where they mention using datasets for training and testing their proposed model. I will carefully read through this section to identify any specific datasets that are referenced.

In section 6, the authors mention that they used a dataset of **32,000 optimization problems** with randomly sampled parameters and optimal solutions for training their model. They also generated a test dataset of **1,000 iterations’ objective values**, averaging over **1,024 pre-generated optimization problems**. However, they do not provide specific names or citations for these datasets.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for these datasets, I will note that the datasets are derived from the context of optimization problems but lack specific references. This is important to highlight, as it indicates that while the datasets are significant for the research, they are not formally published datasets that can be cited.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works provide datasets that could be relevant to the experiments conducted in this paper. I will look for any papers that might have published datasets related to optimization problems or similar experiments.

After reviewing the references, I will compile the information regarding the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include any relevant details about the datasets, even if they are not formally cited. If I find any datasets that are commonly used in the field and are referenced in the paper, I will include their full citations as well.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring that I clearly indicate the nature of the datasets used in the experiments and provide any citations for datasets that are mentioned in the references, even if they are not directly used in this paper.

In conclusion, I will document the datasets as follows:
1. **Dataset of 32,000 optimization problems**: Randomly sampled parameters and optimal solutions (no formal citation).
2. **Test dataset of 1,000 iterations’ objective values**: Averaged over 1,024 pre-generated optimization problems (no formal citation).

If any relevant datasets from the references are identified, I will include their full citations as well. This approach ensures that I comprehensively capture the dataset information from the paper while adhering to the importance of proper citation.
