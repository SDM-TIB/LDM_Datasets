To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "MuST-C: a Multilingual Speech Translation Corpus" by Mattia Antonino Di Gangi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that MuST-C is a multilingual speech translation corpus created to address the scarcity of training corpora for spoken language translation (SLT). This suggests that the paper will detail the dataset itself.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **corpus creation methodology**. In this paper, the authors describe the MuST-C corpus in detail, including its size, language coverage, and the methodology used for its creation. I will focus on the specifics of the dataset, such as the number of hours of audio, the languages included, and the nature of the data (e.g., TED Talks).

In the **methodology section**, the authors explain that MuST-C consists of at least 385 hours of audio recordings from English TED Talks, aligned with manual transcriptions and translations into eight target languages: German, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Romanian, and Russian. This section provides essential details about the dataset's composition.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors mention any comparisons with other datasets or provide additional context about the use of MuST-C in their experiments. They highlight that MuST-C is larger than existing publicly available SLT corpora, which reinforces its significance.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the MuST-C dataset. The authors mention that MuST-C is freely downloadable at mustc.fbk.eu and is released under a Creative Commons license. However, they do not provide a separate citation for the dataset itself, as it is the primary focus of the paper.

Based on this analysis, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **MuST-C Dataset**: A multilingual speech translation corpus containing at least 385 hours of audio recordings from English TED Talks, aligned with manual transcriptions and translations into eight languages.

The full citation for the dataset is:

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
