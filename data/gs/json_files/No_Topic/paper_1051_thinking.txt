To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meeting the 2020 Duolingo Challenge on a Shoestring" by Tadashi Nomoto, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors used data released by Duolingo, which indicates that there is a dataset involved. Specifically, it states that they constructed a corpus from the public dataset containing approximately 4 million pairs of sentences.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **results** sections to find more detailed descriptions of the dataset. In the introduction, the author notes that they created training data by sampling pairs of sentences from the dataset, which reinforces the idea that the Duolingo dataset is central to their work.

In the **experiments** section, the author elaborates on the dataset, stating that they sampled 2,000 pairs of translations for each prompt, resulting in a total of 4,601,000 training instances. This section provides a clearer understanding of how the dataset was utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the dataset used in this research is:

- For the **Duolingo dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Mayhew, K. Bicknell, C. Brust, B. McDowell, W. Monroe, and B. Settles. *Simultaneous translation and paraphrase for language education*. In Proceedings of the ACL Workshop on Neural Generation and Translation (WNGT). ACL, 2020.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Duolingo Dataset
   - **Description**: A public dataset containing approximately 4 million pairs of sentences used for training models in the Duolingo Challenge.
   - **Full Citation**: S. Mayhew, K. Bicknell, C. Brust, B. McDowell, W. Monroe, and B. Settles. *Simultaneous translation and paraphrase for language education*. In Proceedings of the ACL Workshop on Neural Generation and Translation (WNGT). ACL, 2020.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
