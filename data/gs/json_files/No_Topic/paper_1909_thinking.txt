To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Adapter at SemEval-2021 Task 10: Entropy-based Pseudo-Labeler for Source-free Domain Adaptation" by Sangwon Yoon et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed methods are evaluated on data provided by SemEval-2021 task 10, which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention the challenge related to source-free domain adaptation for semantic processing, specifically referencing SemEval-2021 task 10. This indicates that the dataset is likely related to this task.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. They mention that the baseline model is trained on "de-identified clinical notes from the Mayo Clinic," which is a key dataset. They also refer to the development data as the "annotated news portion of the SemEval-2018 Task 6 data" and the test data as "a set of annotated documents extracted from food security warning systems." 

Now, I will compile the details of these datasets and look for full citations in the **References section**:

1. **De-identified clinical notes from the Mayo Clinic**: This dataset is used as the source data for training the models. The citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is important to note its significance in the context of the paper.

2. **SemEval-2018 Task 6 data**: This dataset is referenced as the development data. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Egoitz Laparra, Dongfang Xu, Ahmed Elsayed, Steven Bethard, and Martha Palmer. *SemEval 2018 Task 6: Parsing Time Normalizations*. In Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pages 88â€“96, 2018.

3. **Annotated documents extracted from food security warning systems**: This dataset is mentioned as the test data. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, so I will note it as an important dataset used in the experiments.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for the datasets that have them and clearly note the significance of the others. Finally, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing.
