To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Similarity-Based Non-Scorable Response Detection for Automated Speech Scoring" by Su-Youn Yoon and Shasha Xie, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's purpose, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of automated speech scoring and the need for filtering non-scorable responses. However, they do not mention specific datasets here, so I will move on to the **data section**.

In **section 3 (Data)**, the authors describe the datasets used in their study:

1. **ASR Set**: This dataset consists of approximately 48,000 responses collected from 8,000 non-native speakers. It is used for training the automated speech recognizer (ASR).

2. **FM Set**: This dataset includes 11,560 responses collected from four items in the ASR set, specifically for training and evaluating the filtering model. The authors mention that this set was modified to increase the proportion of non-scorable responses.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the datasets themselves are not typically cited in the same way as published works. Instead, I will note the context in which they were created and used.

The ASR set is derived from an international English language assessment, but the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset. The FM set is also based on the ASR set and does not have a separate citation.

Since the datasets are not formally published works, I will summarize their details without formal citations, as they are internal datasets created for the study.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format for clarity and future reference. 

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **ASR Set**: 48,000 responses from 8,000 non-native speakers used for training the automated speech recognizer.
2. **FM Set**: 11,560 responses used for training and evaluating the filtering model, modified to increase the proportion of non-scorable responses.

While these datasets do not have formal citations, they are crucial for understanding the study's methodology and results.
