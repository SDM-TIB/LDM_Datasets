To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning from Group Comparisons: Exploiting Higher Order Interactions" by Yao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors tested their model on several E-sports datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors describe their datasets in the **Experiments** section, where they mention using data from two online games: **Heroes of the Storm (HotS)** and **Dota 2**. They specify that they collected data for both tournament matches and public games.

I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **HotS Tournament Dataset**: This dataset includes matching records from tournament games for the years 2015 and 2016. It consists of 46,459 games with 113 heroes involved.

2. **HotS Public Dataset (Hero)**: This dataset is derived from the hero league data of public games, containing 139,462 games with 62 heroes.

3. **HotS Public Dataset (Player)**: This dataset also comes from the hero league data but focuses on player performance, consisting of 139,462 games with 7,251 players.

4. **Dota 2 Dataset (Hero)**: This dataset includes matching data from notable players in public games, with 9,610 games involving 54 heroes.

5. **Dota 2 Dataset (Player)**: Similar to the hero dataset, this one focuses on player performance, containing 46,459 games with 30,452 players.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are derived from publicly available sources.

For the **HotS Tournament Dataset**, the authors mention that the data was downloaded from Hotslogs, which can be cited as:
> Hotslogs. *Hotslogs - Heroes of the Storm Statistics*. Available at: https://www.hotslogs.com/Default

For the **Dota 2 Dataset**, the authors refer to OpenDota, which can be cited as:
> OpenDota. *OpenDota - Dota 2 Statistics*. Available at: https://www.opendota.com

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
