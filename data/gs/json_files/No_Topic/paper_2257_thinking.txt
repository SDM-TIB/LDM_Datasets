To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Small-Variance Asymptotics for Hidden Markov Models" by Anirban Roychowdhury et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of small-variance asymptotics to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and mentions results on synthetic and real datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this section, the authors describe their experiments, including comparisons of their algorithms on synthetic data and financial time-series data. 

1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors mention generating a sequence of length 3000 over a varying number of hidden states, with observations sampled from symmetric Gaussian distributions. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation for this synthetic data, as it is generated for the purpose of the experiments.

2. **Financial Time-Series Data**: The authors refer to a dataset consisting of 3668 values of the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 index on consecutive trading days from January 02, 1998, to July 30, 2012. This dataset is used to evaluate the performance of their algorithms in predicting financial trends.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the synthetic data is generated and does not have a formal citation, I will focus on the financial dataset.

For the **S&P 500 index dataset**, the citation is:
> Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. *S&P 500 Index Data*. Available at: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/SP500/downloaddata.

Since the synthetic dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is a generated dataset for experimental purposes.

Finally, I will summarize the findings:
- **Synthetic Data**: No formal citation; generated for experiments.
- **S&P 500 Index Dataset**: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. *S&P 500 Index Data*. Available at: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/SP500/downloaddata.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entries for further processing or documentation.
