To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Literary translation as a three-stage process: machine translation, post-editing and revision" by Lieve Macken et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the study involves a comparison of three versions of target texts produced through a machine translation (MT) workflow. This suggests that there may be datasets related to the translations being analyzed.

Next, I will examine the **Method section**, specifically **section 3 (Method)**, where the authors describe the data they received from the translation company. They mention that the dataset consists of an English novel and three Dutch translations: the machine translation generated by DeepL, the post-edited version, and the revised version. This is a clear indication of the datasets involved in the study.

In **subsection 3.1 (Data)**, the authors provide specific details about the dataset:
- The dataset includes an English novel with **68,762 source words** and three Dutch translations:
  1. **Machine Translation (MT)**: Generated by DeepL.
  2. **Post-Edited (PE)**: The version after post-editing.
  3. **Revised (REV)**: The final version after revision.

The authors also mention that they used a subset of **578 aligned segments** for their analysis, which consists of **7,921 source words** and **9,419 source tokens**. This detailed breakdown is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

Next, I will check the **References section** to ensure that I can provide full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are not traditional datasets with separate publications but rather the outputs of the translation process itself. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are derived from the translation of a specific English novel and the subsequent versions created through machine translation, post-editing, and revision.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:
1. **Machine Translation Dataset**: The output from DeepL for the English novel.
2. **Post-Edited Dataset**: The version of the English novel after post-editing.
3. **Revised Dataset**: The final version of the English novel after revision.

Since these datasets are not published separately, I will not provide traditional citations but will note that they are part of the study conducted by Lieve Macken et al. and are based on the English novel used in their research.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines the datasets and their descriptions, ready for further processing or review.
