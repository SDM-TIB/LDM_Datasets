To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Task-Oriented Dialogue Architecture via Transformer Neural Language Models and Symbolic Injection" by Oscar J. Romero et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the system on the **multi-domain DSTC8 data set**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in **section 3 (Experiment Framework)**, where the authors describe their choice of the DSTC8 dataset. They highlight its rich annotations and size, stating that it contains over 20,000 multi-domain, task-oriented dialogues spanning 45 APIs across 20 domains. This section confirms that the DSTC8 dataset is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** for the full citation of the DSTC8 dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:
> Abhinav Rastogi, Xiaoxue Zang, Srinivas Sunkara, Raghav Gupta, and Pranav Khaitan. *Schema-Guided Dialogue State Tracking Task at DSTC8*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.01359, 2020.

Since the paper primarily discusses the DSTC8 dataset, I will focus on this dataset for extraction.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset. The dataset entry will include the name, description, and citation, which is crucial for proper attribution.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
