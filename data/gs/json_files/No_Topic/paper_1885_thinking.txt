To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Graph Based Semi-Supervised Approach for Analysis of Derivational Nouns in Sanskrit" by Amrith Krishna et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the lack of analyzers for derivational nouns in Sanskrit and the need for labeled data. This suggests that they may have used specific datasets to address this issue.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their approach and mention using multiple lexicons and corpora to obtain their vocabulary. Specifically, they refer to:

1. **IndoWordNet**: A lexical database for the Sanskrit language.
2. **Digital Corpus of Sanskrit**: A digitized collection of Sanskrit texts.
3. **Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary**: A well-known dictionary for Sanskrit.
4. **Apte Sanskrit-Sanskrit Dictionary**: Another important resource for Sanskrit vocabulary.
5. **Sanskrit Heritage Engine**: A tool for processing Sanskrit texts.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail how they obtained seed labels and gold labels from the Apte Sanskrit-Sanskrit dictionary, which indicates that this dictionary was used to create a labeled dataset for their classifier.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

- For **IndoWordNet**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
