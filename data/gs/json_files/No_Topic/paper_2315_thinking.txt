To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On shape classifiers, their metaphorical extension(s) and wordnet potentials" by Francesca Quattri, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the study's focus on Chinese shape classifiers but does not mention any datasets directly. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Shape classifiers as lexico-semantic information carriers)** and **section 3 (Future work)**, as these sections may contain references to datasets used for analysis or examples. However, upon reviewing these sections, it appears that the paper primarily discusses theoretical concepts and does not provide specific datasets or empirical data.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of other authors. The references include various studies and papers related to classifiers, but they do not seem to point to specific datasets that were used in the current research.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide citations for datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this particular paper. 

In summary, I will document that no datasets were identified in the paper "On shape classifiers, their metaphorical extension(s) and wordnet potentials" by Francesca Quattri, and therefore, there are no citations to provide for datasets.
