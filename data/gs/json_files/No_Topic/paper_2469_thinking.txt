To extract datasets from the research paper titled "POS Tagging For Resource Poor Indian Languages Through Feature Projection" by Pruthwik Mishra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and corpus details sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used translated sentences from a pair of languages, which suggests the presence of datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of POS tagging in resource-poor languages and mention the need for annotated corpora. This hints that they may have utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Corpus Details)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **ILCI (Indian Languages Corpora Initiative) parallel corpora**: This dataset is used for feature transfer from a resource-rich language (Hindi) to resource-poor languages. The authors mention that they experimented on 8 languages: Punjabi, Konkani, Bengali, Telugu, Malayalam, Urdu, Marathi, and Gujarati.

2. **Hindi Treebank**: This dataset is described as a multi-layered representation of sentences with syntactic and semantic annotation. It includes 21,000 sentences and 450,000 tokens, and it is used to ensure high-quality projection of POS tags.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ILCI parallel corpora**, the citation is:
  > Narayan Choudhary and Girish Nath Jha. *Creating multilingual parallel corpora in Indian languages*. In Human Language Technology Challenges for Computer Science and Linguistics, pages 527â€“537. Springer, 2014.

- For the **Hindi Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Akshar Bharati, Rajeev Sangal, Dipti Misra Sharma, and Lakshmi Bai. *Anncorra: Annotating corpora guidelines for POS and chunk annotation for Indian languages*. LTRC-TR31, 2006.

With these citations in hand, I will now prepare to create entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
