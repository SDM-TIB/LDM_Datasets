To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simultaneous Object Detection and Ranking with Weak Supervision" by Matthew B. Blaschko, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on the **INRIA pedestrian detection dataset** and the **PASCAL VOC dataset**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly focusing on the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention the **INRIA pedestrian detection dataset** and the **PASCAL VOC dataset** in the context of their experimental validation. 

In the **experiments section**, they provide details about the datasets:
1. **INRIA Pedestrian Detection Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of their object detection method. It contains images with pedestrians and is commonly used in the field for benchmarking detection algorithms.
2. **PASCAL VOC Dataset**: This dataset is another benchmark used for object detection tasks, which includes various object categories and is widely recognized in the computer vision community.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **INRIA Pedestrian Detection Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dalal, N., & Triggs, B. (2005). Histogram of Oriented Gradients for Human Detection. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), volume 2, pages 886–893.

- For the **PASCAL VOC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K. I., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2010). The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2), 303–338.

Having gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will now prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing.
