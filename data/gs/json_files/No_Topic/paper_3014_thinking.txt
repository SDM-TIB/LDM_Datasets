To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DualGraph: A graph-based method for reasoning about label noise" by HaiYang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three datasets: **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **Clothing1M**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research and should be documented.

Next, I will look for specific details about each dataset in the **experiments section**. The authors provide a brief description of each dataset:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for evaluating machine learning algorithms.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class. It is also widely used for benchmarking.

3. **Clothing1M**: A large-scale dataset containing 1 million images of clothing obtained from online shopping websites. The dataset is classified into 14 categories, and the labels are generated from surrounding texts, which may contain errors.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. University of Toronto, 05 2012.

- For **Clothing1M**, the citation is:
  > Tong Xiao, Tian Xia, Yi Yang, Chang Huang, and Xiaogang Wang. *Learning from massive noisy labeled data for image classification*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2691â€“2699, 2015.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
