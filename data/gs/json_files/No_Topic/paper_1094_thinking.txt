To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inter-annotator Agreement for Dependency Annotation of Learner Language" by Marwa Ragheb and Markus Dickinson, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for reliably annotated learner corpora, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Inter-annotator agreement study)**, where the authors describe their study and the texts used for annotation. They mention that they selected six essays from a learner corpus of written essays collected from students entering Indiana University. This indicates that the learner corpus is a dataset of interest.

In **section 3.1 (Selection of annotation texts)**, the authors specify that they randomly selected six essays based on learner proficiency and native language. They also mention that the essays were divided into two texts for annotation. However, they do not provide a specific name for the dataset itself, which is a common practice in research papers.

I will also check the **References section** to see if the authors cite any specific datasets or related works that might provide further context or details about the learner corpus. However, it appears that the dataset is not formally named in the references.

The key dataset identified is the **learner corpus of written essays** collected from students at Indiana University. While the paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset, I will note that it is based on the work of the authors and their research context.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset name and any relevant details, even if a formal citation is not provided. The dataset entry will reflect the context in which it was used and the authors' contributions.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
