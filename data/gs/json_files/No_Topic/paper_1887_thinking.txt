To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probe-Less Probing of BERT’s Layer-Wise Linguistic Knowledge with Masked Word Prediction" by Tatsuya Aoyama and Nathan Schneider, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study analyzes BERT's predictions on an English corpus, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention using **STREUSLE 4.4**, a corpus of web reviews written in English. This section provides specific details about the dataset, including the number of documents, sentences, and tokens, as well as the types of annotations it contains.

The authors state that STREUSLE 4.4 contains **723 documents, 3,813 sentences, and 55,590 tokens**, with rich annotations of various syntactic and lexical-semantic information, including **3,013 strong multiword expressions**. This detailed description confirms that STREUSLE 4.4 is the primary dataset used in their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the STREUSLE dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **STREUSLE 4.4**, the citation is:
  > Nathan Schneider, Jena D. Hwang, Vivek Srikumar, Jakob Prange, Austin Blodgett, Sarah R. Moeller, Aviram Stern, Adi Bitan, and Omri Abend. *Comprehensive supersense disambiguation of English prepositions and possessives*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 185–196, Melbourne, Australia, 2018. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for STREUSLE 4.4, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the study.
