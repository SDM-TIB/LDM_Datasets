To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Sentential Patterns of Various Rhetoric Moves for Assisted Academic Writing" by Jim Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a method for extracting sentential patterns from a corpus, which suggests that a dataset is involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) and mention the use of a corpus for extracting patterns. They reference the **Macmillan English Dictionary** and the **Citeseerx corpus** as sources for their work. This indicates that these are potential datasets.

Next, I will look at **section 4 (Implementation and Setting)**, where the authors describe their data sources in more detail. They explicitly mention using the **CiteSeerx corpus**, which consists of about four million computer science abstracts. This is a significant dataset for their research.

Additionally, they reference the **Argumentative Zoning corpus**, created and annotated by Teufel and collaborators, which consists of 80 AZ-annotated conference articles in computational linguistics. This dataset is also crucial for their methodology.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. For the **CiteSeerx corpus**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, it is generally known as:
   > CiteSeerX. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/

2. For the **Argumentative Zoning corpus**, the citation is:
   > Teufel, S. (2010). The Structure of Scientific Articles: Applications to Citation Indexing and Summarization. Center for the Study of Language and Information-Lecture Notes.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
