To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards HDR and HFR Video from Rolling-Mixed-Bit Spikings" by Yakun Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of reconstructing HDR videos and mentions experiments conducted on synthetic and real-synthetic data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to find specific mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors mention that they conducted experiments on both synthetic and real-synthetic data. I will look for any detailed descriptions of these datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state that the dataset utilized to train RMB-Net includes three components: RMB spikings, ground truth optical flows, and ground truth HDR video frames. This indicates that there are specific datasets involved in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper references other works that may provide datasets or methodologies relevant to their research. 

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors synthesized RMB spikings using a mechanism described in the paper. However, they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset since it is generated from their own methodology.

2. **Real-Synthetic Data**: The authors mention collecting 10 groups of real data, but again, they do not provide a specific citation for these datasets as they are based on their own experiments.

3. **Ground Truth Optical Flows and HDR Video Frames**: The authors refer to using ground truth data for training, but they do not specify a citation for these datasets either. They mention that the ground truth HDR video frames were synthesized with alternating-exposure videos from a previous work (Chang et al. [2]).

The only dataset that has a clear citation is the one referenced from Chang et al. [2], which is:
   > Yakun Chang, Chu Zhou, Yuchen Hong, Liwen Hu, Chao Xu, Tiejun Huang, and Boxin Shi. *1000 FPS HDR video with a Spike-RGB hybrid camera*. In Proc. of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 22180â€“22190, 2023.

Since the other datasets are either synthesized or not explicitly cited, I will note that down as well.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring to include the full citations for any datasets that were referenced in the paper.
