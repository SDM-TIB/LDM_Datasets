To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparing Data Sources and Architectures for Deep Visual Representation Learning in Semantics" by Douwe Kiela, Anita L. Veró, and Stephen Clark, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study compares various data sources for retrieving images, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **section 3 (Sources of Image Data)**, where the authors provide a detailed overview of the datasets used in their experiments. They mention several data sources, including:

1. **Google Images**: A search engine for images that retrieves images based on search queries.
2. **Bing Images**: Another search engine similar to Google Images.
3. **Flickr**: A photo-sharing platform where images are tagged by human annotators.
4. **ImageNet**: A large-scale image database constructed for various computer vision applications, organized hierarchically.
5. **ESP Game dataset**: A dataset created through a game where players label images collaboratively.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors mention two intrinsic datasets used for evaluating semantic representation quality:

1. **MEN (Bruni et al., 2012)**: A dataset focusing on relatedness judgments among word pairs.
2. **SimLex-999 (Hill et al., 2015)**: A dataset designed to evaluate genuine similarity between word pairs.

I will now check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Fei-Fei Li. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of CVPR, pages 248–255, 2009.

- For **ESP Game dataset**, the citation is:
  > Luis von Ahn and Laura Dabbish. *Labeling images with a computer game*. In CHI, pages 319–326, 2004.

- For **MEN**, the citation is:
  > Elia Bruni, Gemma Boleda, Marco Baroni, and Nam-Khanh Tran. *Distributional semantics in technicolor*. In ACL, pages 136–145, 2012.

- For **SimLex-999**, the citation is:
  > Felix Hill, Roi Reichart, and Anna Korhonen. *SimLex-999: Evaluating semantic models with (genuine) similarity estimation*. Computational Linguistics, 2015.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
