To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extracting Economic Signals from Central Bank Speeches" by Maximilian Ahrens and Michael McMahon, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research objectives and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the creation of a novel monetary policy shock series based on central bank speeches, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to central bank communications.

Next, I will examine the **data section** (Section 3) in detail, as it is likely to contain explicit mentions of the datasets used in the research. In this section, the authors describe two distinct data subsets:

1. **FEDâ€™s Greenbook Data**: This dataset comprises numerical and text data captured in the 145 Greenbooks released from 1990 to 2013. It includes numerical estimates on various economic figures and forecasts, along with accompanying text that provides context for these forecasts.

2. **Central Bank Speeches Dataset**: This dataset consists of textual transcripts of over 3000 speeches given by different central bank officials from 1993 to 2013.

I will also check the **results section** and **conclusion** to see if the authors provide any additional context or insights regarding the datasets, but the primary details are likely to be in the data section.

After identifying the datasets, I will need to find the full citations for these datasets. I will look for references in the **References section** of the paper to locate the original sources of the datasets mentioned. 

For the **Greenbook Data**, I will cite the original source of the Greenbooks, which is typically the Federal Reserve Board. The citation might look something like this:
> Federal Reserve Board. *Greenbook Reports*. Various years, 1990-2013.

For the **Central Bank Speeches Dataset**, I will need to check if the authors have provided a specific reference or if it is based on publicly available transcripts from the Federal Reserve or other central banks. If the authors have not provided a specific citation, I will reference the general source of central bank speeches, which could be:
> Federal Reserve. *Transcripts of Speeches by Federal Reserve Officials*. Various years, 1993-2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that I accurately represent the datasets as described in the paper. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
