To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disentangling Adversarial Robustness in Directions of the Data Manifold," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments conducted on real datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets for their experiments. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were used in the context of the experiments.

In the experiments section, the authors state that both datasets contain 50,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples. This information is crucial for understanding the scale of the datasets used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
