To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HIBOU: an eBook to improve Text Comprehension and Reading Fluency for Beginning Readers of French" by Ludivine Javourey-Drevet et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the HIBOU application was used in six elementary schools in France, which suggests that there may be data collected from these schools.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Genesis of the project)**, where the authors mention that HIBOU has been used in six primary schools from 2017 to 2019 to analyze the effects of text simplification on reading fluency and comprehension. This section provides a clear indication that there is a dataset related to the reading performance of children.

In **section 4 (Corpus and reading settings)**, the authors describe the ALECTOR corpus, which consists of 79 original texts in French along with their simplified versions. This corpus is crucial as it forms the basis of the texts used in the HIBOU application.

I will also check **section 5 (Learning activities)**, where the authors discuss the multiple-choice questions and reading times collected from the children. This reinforces the existence of a dataset related to reading comprehension and fluency.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **ALECTOR Corpus**: The citation for the ALECTOR corpus is:
   > Gala, N., Tack, A., Javourey-Drevet, L., François, T., & Ziegler, J. C. (2020a, May). Alector: A parallel corpus of simplified French texts with alignments of misreadings by poor and dyslexic readers. In Language Resources and Evaluation for Language Technologies (LREC). European Language Resources Association, Marseille, France, 1353-1361.

2. **Reading Performance Dataset**: While the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset collected from the six schools, it is referenced in the context of the authors' own studies. The relevant citation for the study that discusses the effects of text simplification is:
   > Javourey-Drevet, L. (2021). La simplification de textes comme outil pour améliorer la compréhension de lecture chez les enfants à l'école primaire: une étude en longitudinal avec des textes littéraires et scientifiques chez des enfants entre 7 et 9 ans. PhD doctoral dissertation, Aix-Marseille Université.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
