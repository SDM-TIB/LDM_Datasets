To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lingua Custodia’s participation at the WMT 2021 Machine Translation using Terminologies shared task" by Melissa Ailem, Jinghsu Liu, and Raheel Qader, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses participation in a shared task involving machine translation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for the three language pairs: English to French, Russian, and Chinese. This section is crucial as it outlines the training data selection, development, and test sets, as well as the terminologies used.

In this section, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **English → French Dataset**: This dataset includes various sources such as News Crawl 2020, NCv16, UN, Common Crawl, and Europarl v10, with a total of 5,186,989 sentences, of which 521,119 are term-grounded sentences.

2. **English → Russian Dataset**: This dataset comprises sources like News Commentary, Wikititles, ParaCrawl, and Common Crawl, totaling 7,165,738 sentences, with 701,058 being term-grounded.

3. **English → Chinese Dataset**: The sources for this dataset include News Crawl 2020, Wikititles, and ParaCrawl, with a total of 6,322,275 sentences, of which 912,063 are term-grounded.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, the datasets themselves are derived from publicly available corpora, and the authors do not provide specific citations for these datasets in the references. Instead, they reference the original sources of the data.

For the English → French dataset, the citation for the relevant work is:
> Melissa Ailem, Jingshu Liu, and Raheel Qader. *Encouraging neural machine translation to satisfy terminology constraints*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL-IJCNLP 2021, pages 1450–1455, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics.

For the English → Russian dataset, the citation for the relevant work is:
> Anastasopoulos, A., Besacier, L., Cross, J., Gallé, M., Koehn, P., Nikoulina, V., et al. *On the evaluation of machine translation for terminology consistency*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.11891.

For the English → Chinese dataset, the citation for the relevant work is:
> Dinu, G., Mathur, P., Federico, M., and Al-Onaizan, Y. *Training neural machine translation to apply terminology constraints*. Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics, page 3063–3068.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
