To extract datasets from the research paper titled "YZU-NLP Team at SemEval-2016 Task 4: Ordinal Sentiment Classification Using a Recurrent Convolutional Network" by Yunchao He et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a system for classifying sentiment in tweets, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the dataset used for their evaluation. In this section, they mention that they evaluated their model using data from the SemEval-2016 Task 4 subtask. They provide a summary of the dataset statistics in Table 1, which includes details about the number of tweets in various splits (Gold Train, Gold Dev, Gold Devtest, and Test).

The authors also mention using an additional dataset from the **Vader corpus** to improve their model's performance. This dataset contains 4,000 tweets annotated with sentiment ratings, which is crucial for understanding the training process of their model.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. For the **SemEval-2016 Task 4 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Preslav Nakov, Alan Ritter, Sara Rosenthal, Veselin Stoyanov, and Fabrizio Sebastiani. *SemEval-2016 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter*. In Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, Association for Computational Linguistics, San Diego, California, 2016.

2. For the **Vader corpus**, the citation is:
   > Clayton J. Hutto, and Eric Gilbert. *Vader: A parsimonious rule-based model for sentiment analysis of social media text*. In Proceedings of the Eighth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, 2014.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
