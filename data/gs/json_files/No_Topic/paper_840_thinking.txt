To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using CollGram to Compare Formulaic Language in Human and Machine Translation" by Yves Bestgen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the PLECI corpus, which is a translation corpus used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **Method section**, specifically **section 2.1 (Translation Corpus)**, where the author describes the PLECI corpus in detail. The text states that the corpus consists of sentence-aligned translations of quality newspaper articles from Le Monde diplomatique, published between 2005 and 2012. It mentions the total word counts for both the original French texts and their English translations, which indicates that this corpus is a significant dataset for the research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PLECI corpus. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the PLECI corpus itself, as it is referenced through a URL. Therefore, I will note the URL provided in the text for the PLECI corpus: uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/ilc/cecl/pleci.html.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **PLECI Corpus**: This dataset is a sentence-aligned translation corpus of quality newspaper articles written in French and published in Le Monde diplomatique, with corresponding English translations. It includes 279 texts, totaling 570,000 words in the original French and 500,000 words in English.

Since the PLECI corpus is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will ensure to document it thoroughly, including its description and the URL for reference.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset and its citation, ensuring that it is ready for further processing or review.
