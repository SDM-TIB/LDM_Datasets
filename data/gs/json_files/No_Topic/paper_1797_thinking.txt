To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Evaluation of Multimodal Machine Translation" by Desmond Elliott, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the use of image data in multimodal machine translation, which suggests that datasets related to images and translations may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the Multi30K dataset. They reference it as a dataset used for evaluating multimodal translation systems, indicating its importance in their research.

In the **Systems Evaluation section (3)**, the authors explicitly state that the three evaluated multimodal translation systems were trained on the **Multi30K dataset**, which consists of 29,000 English–German–image tuples. This confirms that this dataset is central to their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Multi30K dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Desmond Elliott, Stella Frank, Khalil Sima’an, and Lucia Specia. *Multi30K: Multilingual English-German Image Descriptions*. In Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Vision and Language, pages 70–74, 2016.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the only dataset to extract is the Multi30K dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. This will ensure that the extraction is complete and accurate for any further processing or review.
