To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online List Labeling with Predictions" by Samuel McCauley et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their theoretical results empirically on "numerous real datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for empirical validation. In this section, the authors mention that they use datasets from the **SNAP Large Network Dataset Collection**. They specifically refer to several temporal datasets, including **Gowalla**, **MOOC**, and **AskUbuntu**.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will look for any specific descriptions or characteristics of these datasets within the experiments section. The authors mention that the Gowalla dataset is a location-based social networking dataset where users share their locations by checking in. This provides context for its use in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the SNAP dataset collection, which is crucial for proper citation. The citation for the SNAP datasets is:

- **SNAP Large Network Dataset Collection**:
  > Jure Leskovec and Andrej Krevl. *SNAP Datasets: Stanford large network dataset collection*. http://snap.stanford.edu/data, June 2014.

Additionally, I will note the specific datasets mentioned in the experiments:

1. **Gowalla Dataset**: A location-based social networking dataset where users share their locations by checking in.
   - Citation: Leskovec, J., & Krevl, A. (2014). *SNAP Datasets: Stanford large network dataset collection*. http://snap.stanford.edu/data.

2. **MOOC Dataset**: This dataset is used in the experiments but requires further details from the paper for a complete citation.
   - Citation: Leskovec, J., & Krevl, A. (2014). *SNAP Datasets: Stanford large network dataset collection*. http://snap.stanford.edu/data.

3. **AskUbuntu Dataset**: Similar to the MOOC dataset, this dataset is also referenced but needs more details for a complete citation.
   - Citation: Leskovec, J., & Krevl, A. (2014). *SNAP Datasets: Stanford large network dataset collection*. http://snap.stanford.edu/data.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
