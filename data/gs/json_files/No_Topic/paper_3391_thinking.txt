To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Complex Word Identification Using Character n-grams" by Maja Popović, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses the use of character n-grams for identifying complex words in multiple languages, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the author describes the datasets used for the Complex Word Identification (CWI) shared task. Here, I will look for specific details about each dataset, including their characteristics and the languages they cover.

In section 3, the author mentions that the organizers provided training and test datasets for **English, German, Spanish**, and a test set for **French**. The English dataset consists of a mixture of professionally written news, non-professionally written news, and Wikipedia articles. The German, Spanish, and French datasets are derived from Wikipedia pages in their respective languages.

I will note the following datasets:

1. **English Dataset**: This dataset includes professionally written news (News), non-professionally written news (WikiNews), and Wikipedia articles (Wiki). It was annotated by 20 people (10 native and 10 non-native speakers).

2. **German Dataset**: This dataset is taken from German Wikipedia pages and was annotated by 10 people, a mix of native and non-native speakers.

3. **Spanish Dataset**: Similar to the German dataset, this one is derived from Spanish Wikipedia pages and also annotated by 10 people.

4. **French Dataset**: Only a test dataset was provided for French, intended for cross-lingual CWI, and it was annotated by 10 people.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are typically found in the papers referenced by the author. 

The relevant citations for the datasets are:

- For the **CWI shared task datasets**, the citation is:
  > Seid Muhie Yimam, Chris Biemann, Shervin Malmasi, Gustavo Paetzold, Lucia Specia, Sanja Štajner, Anaïs Tack, and Marcos Zampieri. *A Report on the Complex Word Identification Shared Task 2018*. In Proceedings of the 13th Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications, pages 341–348, New Orleans, Louisiana, June 5, 2018.

- For the **SemEval 2016 CWI shared task**, which may provide context for the datasets, the citation is:
  > Gustavo Paetzold and Lucia Specia. *SemEval 2016 Task 11: Complex Word Identification*. In Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2016), pages 560–569, San Diego, California.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
