To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discriminative Shape from Shading in Uncalibrated Illumination" by Stephan R. Richter and Stefan Roth, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have enabled their approach through a "new large-scale dataset for training and analysis." This suggests that a dataset is indeed present, but I need to find its specifics.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of estimating surface normals and mention the need for suitable training data. They reference previous works that relied on limited datasets, hinting that they have developed or utilized a more comprehensive dataset.

I will then focus on **section 4 (Data for Analysis and Training)**, where the authors explicitly describe their dataset. They mention that they have created a dataset of shapes designed by artists, which consists of 100 objects that cover a range of categories, primarily organic shapes like humans and animals. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's size and variety.

In addition, I will look for any references to other datasets used for comparison or evaluation in the **experiments** section. The authors mention evaluating their method on various datasets, including the **MIT intrinsic image dataset** and others, which may be relevant for citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the dataset created by the authors, I will note that it is a collection of 3D models created by artists, but since it does not have a formal citation, I will describe it as:
   > Artist-created 3D model dataset, consisting of 100 objects covering various organic shapes.

2. For the **MIT intrinsic image dataset**, the citation is:
   > R. Grosse, M. K. Johnson, E. H. Adelson, and W. T. Freeman. *Ground truth dataset and baseline evaluations for intrinsic image algorithms*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1-8, 2009.

3. The authors also reference other datasets in their comparisons, such as those used by Barron and Malik, which I will summarize as:
   > J. T. Barron and J. Malik. *Shape, albedo, and illumination from a single image of an unknown object*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
