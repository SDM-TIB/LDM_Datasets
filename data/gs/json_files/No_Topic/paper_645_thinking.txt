To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Annotating and Analyzing Biased Sentences in News Articles using Crowdsourcing" by Sora Lim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a novel news bias dataset, which is a strong indication that a dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the construction of their dataset. They mention that their dataset consists of **966 sentences from 46 English-language news articles** covering **4 different events**. This section will provide specific details about the dataset, including its purpose and structure.

The authors detail the four news events that the dataset covers:
1. **NFL** - Related to player protests.
2. **Facebook** - Concerning data misuse.
3. **North Korea** - Involving U.S. diplomatic relations.
4. **Johnson** - About a lawmaker's suicide amid allegations.

I will also note that the dataset was constructed using articles collected from Google News, which adds context to its creation.

In the **References section**, I will look for any citations related to the dataset. The authors mention that their dataset can be downloaded from a GitHub repository, which is crucial for providing a full citation. The citation for the dataset will be:
> Lim, S., Jatowt, A., & Yoshikawa, M. (2020). Annotating and Analyzing Biased Sentences in News Articles using Crowdsourcing. In Proceedings of the 12th Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2020), pages 1478–1484. Marseille, 11–16 May 2020.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:
- **Dataset Name**: News Bias Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset consisting of 966 sentences from 46 English-language news articles covering 4 different events, annotated for bias on a sentence level.
- **Usage**: The dataset can be used for analyzing news bias and developing methods for news bias detection.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
