To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards the Extraction of Customer-to-Customer Suggestions from Reviews" by Sapna Negi and Paul Buitelaar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors provide a benchmark dataset for the task of detecting customer-to-customer (CTC) suggestions, which suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets they prepared for their experiments. They mention two specific types of reviews:

1. **Hotel Reviews Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the work of Wachsmuth et al. (2014), which provides a large collection of TripAdvisor hotel reviews. The reviews are segmented into statements, each tagged with sentiment labels. The authors take a smaller subset of these reviews for their dataset.

2. **Electronics Reviews Dataset**: This dataset is based on the work of Hu et al. (2004), which consists of reviews of electronic products that are also split into sentences, with sentiment labels assigned to each sentence.

In the **Results and Discussion section**, the authors confirm that these datasets are used for their experiments, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Hotel Reviews Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Henning Wachsmuth, Martin Trenkmann, Benno Stein, Gregor Engels, and Tsvetomira Palakarska. *A review corpus for argumentation analysis*. In Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing, volume 8404 of LNCS, pages 115–127, Kathmandu, Nepal. Springer, 2014.

- For the **Electronics Reviews Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Minqing Hu and Bing Liu. *Mining and summarizing customer reviews*. In Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, KDD ’04, pages 168–177, New York, NY, USA. ACM, 2004.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
