To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Experiment in Integrating Sentiment Features for Tech Stock Prediction in Twitter" by Tien Thanh Vu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes Twitter messages to predict stock price movements for four tech companies, which suggests that there is a dataset related to Twitter data.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** (3.1) where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that they crawled **5,001,460 daily Tweets** from April 1, 2011, to May 31, 2011, using the Twitter online streaming API. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

In addition, the authors specify that they filtered the Tweets to focus on four tech companies: **Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN)**. They also provide the number of relevant Tweets for each company after filtering, which is crucial information for the dataset description.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. However, since the dataset is primarily derived from Twitter and does not have a formal citation like traditional datasets, I will note that the dataset is based on Twitter data without a specific reference.

The key dataset I will extract is as follows:

1. **Twitter Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5,001,460 Tweets collected over a period of 41 market days, focusing on sentiment related to the stock movements of four tech companies (AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN).

Since there are no formal citations for the Twitter dataset, I will document it as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Twitter Dataset for Tech Stock Prediction
- **Description**: A dataset containing 5,001,460 Tweets collected from April 1, 2011, to May 31, 2011, focusing on sentiment analysis for predicting stock price movements of Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.
- **Citation**: Not applicable (data derived from Twitter API).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
