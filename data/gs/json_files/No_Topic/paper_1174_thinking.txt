To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Large-Scale Dataset for Empathetic Response Generation" by Anuradha Welivita, Yubo Xie, and Pearl Pu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have developed a large-scale silver dataset consisting of 1 million dialogues annotated with various emotions and intents, which suggests that this dataset is significant.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the limitations of existing empathetic datasets and the need for a larger dataset. They mention the **EmpatheticDialogues dataset** and its analysis, which indicates that it is relevant to their work.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the process of curating the new dataset, **EDOS (Emotional Dialogues in OpenSubtitles)**, which contains 1 million emotional dialogues. They detail how they used movie subtitles from the OpenSubtitles corpus and applied a weak labeler to annotate the dialogues with emotions and intents. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's size and the emotions it includes.

I will also check the **results and comparison sections** to see if the authors compare EDOS with other datasets. They mention several existing datasets, including:

1. **IEMOCAP**: A dataset with 151 dialogues and 7,433 utterances annotated with emotions like Joy, Sadness, Anger, etc.

2. **MELD**: A dataset with 1,433 dialogues and 13,708 utterances annotated with emotions like Joy, Surprise, Sadness, etc.

3. **DailyDialogue**: A dataset with 12,218 dialogues and 103,607 utterances annotated with emotions.

4. **EmpatheticDialogues**: A dataset with 24,850 dialogues and 107,220 utterances annotated with 32 fine-grained emotions and 8 empathetic response intents.

5. **EDOS**: The new dataset created by the authors, containing 1 million dialogues annotated with 32 fine-grained emotions and 8 empathetic response intents.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as specified. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets discussed in the paper, along with their respective citations for further reference.
