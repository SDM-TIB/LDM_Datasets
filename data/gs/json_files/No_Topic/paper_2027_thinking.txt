To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Recovery of Dense Correspondence and Cosegmentation in Two Images" by Tatsunori Taniai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on a new dataset of 400 image pairs with ground truth, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention the dataset in the **experiments section**. They describe their dataset as comprising 400 image pairs divided into three groups:

1. **FG3DCar**: Contains 195 image pairs of vehicles.
2. **JODS**: Contains 81 image pairs of airplanes, horses, and cars.
3. **PASCAL**: Contains 124 image pairs of bicycles, motorbikes, buses, cars, and trains.

The authors also mention that some images and segmentation masks are taken from existing datasets, which suggests that there are additional references to consider.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the following datasets:

- For **FG3DCar**, the citation is:
  > Y.-L. Lin, V. I. Morariu, W. Hsu, and L. S. Davis. *Jointly optimizing 3D model fitting and fine-grained classification*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For **JODS**, the citation is:
  > M. Rubinstein, A. Joulin, J. Kopf, and C. Liu. *Unsupervised joint object discovery and segmentation in internet images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1939â€“1946, 2013.

- For **PASCAL**, the citation is:
  > B. Hariharan, P. Arbelaez, L. Bourdev, S. Maji, and J. Malik. *Semantic contours from inverse detectors*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2011.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented each dataset along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
