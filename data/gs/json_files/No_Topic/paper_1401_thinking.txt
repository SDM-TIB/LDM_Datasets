To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AOD-Net: All-in-One Dehazing Network" by Boyi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the model is evaluated on both synthesized and natural hazy image datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Implementation)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **NYU2 Depth Database**: This dataset is used to create synthesized hazy images. The authors specify that they use ground-truth images with depth metadata from this database, taking 27,256 images for training and 3,170 for testing.

2. **Middlebury Stereo Database**: The authors also mention using 800 full-size synthetic images from this database as TestSet B.

Additionally, they refer to a set of natural hazy images collected for evaluating the model's generalization performance, but they do not provide a specific name or citation for this dataset.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **NYU2 Depth Database**, the citation is:
  > N. Silberman, D. Hoiem, P. Kohli, and R. Fergus. *Indoor segmentation and support inference from RGBD images*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 746–760. Springer, 2012.

- For the **Middlebury Stereo Database**, the citation is:
  > D. Scharstein and R. Szeliski. *High-accuracy stereo depth maps using structured light*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2003. Proceedings. 2003 IEEE Computer Society Conference on, volume 1, pages I–I. IEEE, 2003.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.
