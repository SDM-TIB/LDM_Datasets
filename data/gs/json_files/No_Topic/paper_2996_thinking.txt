To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Causal Investigation of Public Opinion during the COVID-19 Pandemic via Social Media Text" by Michael Jantscher and Roman Kern, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of sentiment analysis on Tweets related to COVID-19, which suggests that there is a dataset of Tweets being utilized.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail, particularly the **Materials & Methods** section. In this section, the authors mention the use of a **geotagged Twitter dataset** that includes COVID-19 related keywords and hashtags. This indicates that the dataset is based on Tweets collected during the pandemic.

I will also check for any additional datasets mentioned in the **Results** or **Discussion** sections. The paper references the **COVID-19 Government Response Tracker** developed by the University of Oxford, which provides a measure of government response intensity, known as the **Stringency Index**. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

In the **References section**, I will find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Geotagged Twitter Dataset**: The authors refer to a dataset collected by Abd-Alrazaq et al. (2021) that includes COVID-19 related Tweet IDs and sentiment analysis. The citation is:
   > Abd-Alrazaq, A., Alhuwail, D., Househ, M., Hamdi, M., and Shah, Z. (2020). Top concerns of tweeters during the covid-19 pandemic: infoveillance study. *Journal of Medical Internet Research*, 22(4):e19016.

2. **COVID-19 Government Response Tracker**: The citation for the Stringency Index is:
   > Hale, T., Angrist, N., Goldszmidt, R., Kira, B., Petherick, A., Phillips, T., Webster, S., Cameron-Blake, E., Hallas, L., Majumdar, S., et al. (2021). A global panel database of pandemic policies (Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker). *Nature Human Behaviour*, pages 1â€“10.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
