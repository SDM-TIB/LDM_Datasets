To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "The binary trio at SemEval-2019 Task 5: Multitarget Hate Speech Detection in Tweets" by Patricia Chiril et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a supervised approach to hate speech detection in English tweets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they focus on hate speech detection towards immigrants and women, and they reference a collection of English tweets annotated for hate speech as part of HateEval@SemEval2019. This is a strong indication that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Multitarget hate speech detection systems)**, particularly the **3.1 Data** subsection, where the authors describe their data sources. They mention two datasets:

1. **HateEval Dataset**: This dataset contains English tweets annotated for hate speech against immigrants and women, which was part of the SemEval 2019 task. The authors reference the work of Basile et al. (2019) for this dataset.

2. **DATASET++**: This is a new dataset created by the authors, which includes tweets collected based on the most used hashtags in both hateful and non-hateful tweets. The authors describe how they constructed this dataset based on their analysis of the original HateEval dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **HateEval Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Valerio Basile, Cristina Bosco, Elisabetta Fersini, Debora Nozza, Viviana Patti, Francisco Rangel, Paolo Rosso, and Manuela Sanguinetti. *SemEval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in Twitter*. In Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), pages 489â€“493, Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019.

- The **DATASET++** does not have a separate citation since it is a dataset created by the authors based on their analysis. However, I will note that it is derived from the original HateEval dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.
