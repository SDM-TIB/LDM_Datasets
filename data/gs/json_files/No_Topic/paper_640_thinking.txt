To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying Cleartext in Historical Ciphers" by Maria-Elena Gambardella et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use historical language corpora and a specific database for their analysis, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Method)**, where the authors describe the data used for their study. They mention the **DECODE database**, which contains a collection of almost 3000 ciphertexts and keys from Early Modern times in Europe. This is a significant dataset for their research.

In this section, they also mention that the dataset consists of **214 documents in 8 different languages**. They provide details about the language distribution and the number of documents used for training and testing. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The DECODE database is cited as follows:
- Megyesi, B., Blomqvist, N., and Pettersson, E. (2019). *The DECODE database: Collection of historical ciphers and keys*. In The 2nd International Conference on Historical Cryptology, HistoCrypt 2019, June 23-26 2019, Mons, Belgium, pages 69–78.

Additionally, the authors reference two specific ciphers used in their study:
1. **The Borg Cipher**: 
   - Aldarrab, N., Knight, K., and Megyesi, B. (2017). *The Borg Cipher*. Available at: https://cl.lingfil.uu.se/˜bea/borg. Accessed: 2020-01-31.
   
2. **The Copiale Cipher**: 
   - Pettersson, E. and Megyesi, B. (2011–2020). *The Copiale Cipher*. Available at: https://cl.lingfil.uu.se/˜bea/copiale. Accessed: 2020-01-31.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
