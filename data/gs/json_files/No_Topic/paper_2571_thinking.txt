To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks" by Jinsung Yoon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various real and synthetic time-series datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention four specific datasets:

1. **Sines Dataset**: This dataset consists of multivariate sinusoidal sequences with different frequencies and phases, providing continuous-valued, periodic data.

2. **Stocks Dataset**: This dataset includes daily historical Google stock prices from 2004 to 2019, featuring various attributes such as volume and prices (high, low, opening, closing, and adjusted closing).

3. **Energy Dataset**: The UCI Appliances energy prediction dataset is characterized by noisy periodicity and includes multivariate continuous-valued measurements taken at close intervals.

4. **Events Dataset**: This dataset consists of sequences of events and their timings, specifically from a private lung cancer pathways dataset, which includes one-hot encoded sequences of event types.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used, as they are either publicly available datasets or proprietary datasets without formal citations.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the dataset names and descriptions. Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets, I will note that these datasets are commonly known or publicly available.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I have accurately captured the relevant details about each dataset.
