To extract datasets from the research paper titled "L2-Net: Deep Learning of Discriminative Patch Descriptor in Euclidean Space" by Yurun Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that L2-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **Brown datasets**, **Oxford dataset**, and the **HPatches dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are significant for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 3.2 (Training data and preprocessing)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training. Here, they specifically mention:

1. **Brown Dataset**: The authors describe it as consisting of local patches extracted from different scenes, with three subsets: Yosemite, Notre Dame, and Liberty. They note that the dataset contains approximately 500K 3D points (patches).

2. **HPatches Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as being composed of local patches with different degrees of viewpoint and illumination changes. The authors state that it contains around 190K 3D points (patches).

Additionally, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used for training and evaluation, which is further validated by the results presented in the paper.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Brown Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Brown, G. Hua, and S.A.G. Winder. *Discriminative learning of local image descriptors*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2010.

- For the **Oxford Dataset**, the citation is:
  > K. Mikolajczyk and C. Schmid. *A performance evaluation of local descriptors*. PAMI, pages 257â€“263, 2003.

- For the **HPatches Dataset**, the citation is:
  > V. Balntas, K. Lenc, A. Vedaldi, and K. Mikolajczyk. *HPatches: A benchmark and evaluation of handcrafted and learned local descriptors*. In CVPR, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
