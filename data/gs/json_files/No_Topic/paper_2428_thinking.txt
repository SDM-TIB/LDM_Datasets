To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UTH_CCB: A Report for SemEval 2014 – Task 7 Analysis of Clinical Text," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the task and mentions the use of clinical notes, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention the training and development sets from the 2013 ShARe/CLEF challenge, detailing the number of clinical notes in each set and the types of clinical notes included (discharge summaries, radiology reports, and ECG/ECHO reports). 

The paper states that the training set consists of **199 notes** and the development set has **99 notes**, with specific counts of disorder entities and unique Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) mapped. This section provides a clear description of the datasets used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper refers to the 2013 ShARe/CLEF challenge, which is crucial for citation purposes. 

The citation for the ShARe/CLEF challenge is:
> Suominen, H., Salanterä, S., Velupillai, S., Chapman, W. W., Savova, G., & Elhadad, N. (2013). Overview of the ShARe/CLEF eHealth Evaluation Lab 2013. In Information Access Evaluation. Multilinguality, Multimodality, and Visualization, 2013, 212–231.

Additionally, I will note that the datasets are derived from clinical notes, but since they are not standalone datasets with separate citations, I will reference the challenge itself as the authoritative source.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the ShARe/CLEF challenge as it is the source of the datasets used in the paper. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets in accordance with the requirements.
