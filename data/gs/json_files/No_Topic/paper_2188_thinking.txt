To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporally-Informed Analysis of Named Entity Recognition" by Shruti Rijhwani and Daniel Preot¸iuc-Pietro, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the introduction of a "novel data set of English tweets annotated with named entities," which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Temporal Twitter Data Set)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. They describe the dataset as consisting of **12,000 English tweets** evenly distributed across six years (2014-2019). This section outlines the data collection process, the annotation methodology, and the specific characteristics of the dataset.

In this section, the authors also mention that the dataset can be downloaded from a GitHub repository, which is crucial for providing access to the dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper references several previous datasets used for named entity recognition in tweets, including:

1. **Broad Twitter Corpus**: 
   > Leon Derczynski, Kalina Bontcheva, and Ian Roberts. *Broad twitter corpus: A diverse named entity recognition resource*. In Proceedings of COLING 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers, pages 1169–1179, Osaka, Japan. The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee.

2. **WNUT-17 Corpus**: 
   > Leon Derczynski, Eric Nichols, Marieke van Erp, and Nut Limsopatham. *Results of the WNUT2017 shared task on novel and emerging entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text, pages 140–147, Copenhagen, Denmark. Association for Computational Linguistics.

3. **Other datasets** mentioned include those from Finin et al. (2010), Ritter et al. (2011), Liu et al. (2011), and the Microposts NEEL Challenge Corpora.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their respective citations for proper attribution.
