To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Harnessing Privileged Information for Hyperbole Detection" by Rhys Biddle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets referenced. The abstract mentions a model for hyperbole detection and indicates that experiments were conducted on an existing hyperbole detection dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (HYPO)**, where the authors introduce the **HYPO dataset**. This section provides a detailed description of the dataset, including its composition and the annotation process. The HYPO dataset consists of hyperbolic utterances collected from various sources, and it is crucial to note that it was introduced by Troiano et al. (2018). This citation is essential for proper referencing.

In addition to the HYPO dataset, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors also describe the **HyperProbe** suite, which consists of synthetic data generated to test hyperbole detection models. However, since HyperProbe is not a traditional dataset but rather a collection of generated test sentences, I will focus on documenting the HYPO dataset for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the HYPO dataset. The citation for the original work introducing the HYPO dataset is:

- Troiano, E., Strapparava, C., Özbal, G., & Tekiroğlu, S. S. (2018). *A computational exploration of exaggeration*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 3296–3304).

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **HYPO Dataset**: An annotated collection of hyperbolic utterances, consisting of 709 hyperbolic sentences, along with their literal paraphrases and non-hyperbolic counterparts.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper referencing. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the relevant datasets from the research paper.
