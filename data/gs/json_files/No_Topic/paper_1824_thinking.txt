To extract datasets from the research paper, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets that the authors reference.

Next, I will proceed to the **methodology** or **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. I will look for any sections explicitly labeled as "Datasets" or similar, where the authors might describe the datasets in detail, including their size, type, and any specific characteristics.

If the paper includes a **results** section, I will also check there for any additional mentions of datasets, as authors sometimes discuss their findings in relation to specific datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as I need to ensure that I provide accurate and complete citations.

For each dataset, I will note the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose, size, and any relevant details.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its description and citation. This will ensure that the extracted information is organized and ready for further use or analysis.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the research paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the citations.
