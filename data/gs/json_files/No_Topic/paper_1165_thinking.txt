To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Crowdsourced Corpus of Multiple Judgments and Disagreement on Anaphoric Interpretation" by Massimo Poesio et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper presents a corpus of anaphoric information, which suggests that a dataset is indeed involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference existing datasets for anaphora resolution, such as ONTONOTES and PRECO, which provides context for the significance of their own dataset. However, I need to find specific details about the dataset they created.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on the corpus or datasets**. In this paper, the relevant information is found in **section 4 (The corpus)**. Here, the authors describe the corpus in detail, including its size and structure. They mention that the corpus consists of 542 documents containing 408,153 tokens and 108,000 markables, which is crucial information for dataset extraction.

The authors also provide a breakdown of the corpus into subsets: **PDgold** (gold-annotated documents) and **PDsilver** (silver-annotated documents). The PDgold subset consists of 45 documents with expert annotations, while PDsilver consists of 497 documents with crowdsourced annotations.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the following datasets:

1. **ONTONOTES**: 
   > Pradhan, S., Moschitti, A., Xue, N., Uryupina, O., & Zhang, Y. (2012). CoNLL-2012 shared task: Modeling multilingual unrestricted coreference in OntoNotes. In Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2012), Jeju, Korea.

2. **PRECO**: 
   > Chen, H., Fan, Z., Lu, H., Yuille, A., & Rong, S. (2018). PreCo: A large-scale dataset in preschool vocabulary for coreference resolution. In Proceedings of EMNLP, pages 172â€“181, Brussels, Belgium.

3. **Phrase Detectives corpus** (the dataset presented in this paper):
   > Chamberlain, J., Poesio, M., & Kruschwitz, U. (2016). Phrase Detectives: A web-based collaborative annotation game. In Proceedings of I-Semantics 2008.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets from the paper:
- PDgold (Phrase Detectives corpus)
- PDsilver (Phrase Detectives corpus)
- ONTONOTES
- PRECO

I will ensure to include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing.
