To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fixed That for You: Generating Contrastive Claims with Semantic Edits" by Christopher Hidey and Kathleen McKeown, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. In the abstract, the authors mention creating a corpus of Reddit comment pairs self-labeled by posters using the acronym FTFY (fixed that for you). This indicates that there is a dataset derived from Reddit comments.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Data)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets. In this section, the authors describe the collection process of the dataset, which consists of 1,083,520 contrastive comment pairs drawn from Reddit. They also mention a crowd-labeled set of 2,625 comments paired with new contrastive responses generated by annotators. This confirms the existence of two distinct datasets:

1. **Reddit Contrastive Comment Pairs**: This dataset contains 1,083,520 pairs of comments where each pair consists of a parent comment and a corresponding FTFY response. The authors explain that these pairs were filtered to ensure they represent contrastive claims.

2. **Crowd-Labeled Contrastive Responses**: This dataset consists of 2,625 comments, each paired with five new contrastive responses generated by additional annotators. This dataset is used for evaluating the quality of the generated claims.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from Reddit and the crowd-labeled responses are generated by the authors' own annotation process, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will document them as follows:

- For the **Reddit Contrastive Comment Pairs**, I will note that the dataset is based on comments scraped from Reddit using the FTFY acronym, and the data was collected from pushshift.io for the period from December 2008 to October 2017.

- For the **Crowd-Labeled Contrastive Responses**, I will mention that this dataset was created through Amazon Mechanical Turk, where annotators generated responses based on the parent comments.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and any relevant details, ensuring to highlight their significance in the context of the research.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
