To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiaHClust: an iterative hierarchical clustering approach for identifying stages in language change" by Christin Schätzle and Hannah Booth, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and case study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the DiaHClust method and hints at its application to a case study involving syntactic change in Icelandic, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of traditional periodization in historical linguistics and mention the need for data-driven methodologies. This indicates that they likely utilized specific datasets to support their claims.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the DiaHClust method and its implementation. Here, they mention using the **Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus (IcePaHC)** as the primary dataset for their case study. This is a crucial dataset, and I will need to extract its details.

In **section 4 (Case study)**, the authors elaborate on the IcePaHC dataset, describing its characteristics, such as being a Penn-style treebank with approximately 1,000,000 words spanning 10 centuries. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in their analysis.

Now, I will locate the **References section** to find the full citation for the IcePaHC dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Joel C. Wallenberg, Anton Karl Ingason, Einar Freyr Sigurðsson, and Eiríkur Rögnvaldsson. *Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus (IcePaHC), version 0.9*. http://linguist.is/icelandic_treebank.

Additionally, I will check for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. The authors reference methodologies and approaches from other studies, but IcePaHC is the primary dataset utilized for their analysis.

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation for IcePaHC as it is critical for proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ready for further processing or review.
