To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoRuSS — a New Prosodically Annotated Corpus of Russian Spontaneous Speech" by Tatiana Kachkovskaia et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract introduces the CoRuSS corpus, which is a new speech corpus based on recordings from 60 native Russian speakers. This indicates that the corpus itself is a dataset.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the corpus, such as **section 2 (Corpus design and creation)**, where the authors describe the types of recordings included in the CoRuSS corpus. They mention three types of recordings: free conversations, monologues, and readings of a phonetically balanced text. This section provides valuable information about the structure and content of the dataset.

In **section 3 (Annotation)**, the authors elaborate on the annotation process, which adds further context to the dataset's usability for research. This section confirms that the corpus is well-annotated, which is crucial for potential users.

I will also check the **conclusion** and **acknowledgment sections** to see if there are any additional insights or mentions of the dataset's significance or future availability.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the CoRuSS dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Kachkovskaia, T., Kocharov, D., Skrelin, P., & Volskaya, N. (2023). CoRuSS — a New Prosodically Annotated Corpus of Russian Spontaneous Speech. *Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Speech and Computer (SPECOM 2023)*.

Since the paper primarily discusses the CoRuSS corpus, I will focus on this single dataset for extraction.

Finally, I will prepare to create an entry for the CoRuSS dataset, ensuring that I include all relevant details and the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset for future reference or analysis.
