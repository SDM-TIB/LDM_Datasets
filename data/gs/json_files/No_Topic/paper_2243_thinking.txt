To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Connecting the Dots between Audio and Text without Parallel Data through Visual Knowledge Transfer," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving state-of-the-art performance on the **ESC50** and **US8K** audio classification tasks, which indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges of audio-text alignment and mentions the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors describe the datasets in the **experiments section**. Here, they provide specific details about the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **ESC50 Dataset**: This dataset contains 2000 audio clips from 50 classes, each with a duration of 5 seconds. It is used for multi-class classification tasks.

2. **US8K Dataset**: This dataset consists of 8732 audio clips from 10 classes, with each clip having a duration of less than 4 seconds. It is also used for multi-class classification.

3. **AudioSet**: This is a benchmark dataset for multi-label classification, containing around 2 million audio clips. The authors mention using both the balanced and unbalanced versions of this dataset.

4. **AudioCaps Dataset**: This dataset builds on AudioSet and provides captions for a subset of audio clips sourced from YouTube.

5. **Clotho Dataset**: This dataset consists of audio clips with a duration of 15-30 seconds, which are used for audio captioning tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
