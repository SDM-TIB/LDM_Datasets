To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Entropy Loss Leads to Poor Margins," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the implications of cross-entropy loss on decision boundaries but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of training neural networks but again does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors present numerical experiments. Here, they mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for training a convolutional neural network to classify horses and planes. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is commonly referenced in the literature, and I can find its citation as follows:

- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the only dataset extracted from this paper is the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. 

In summary, the steps I followed were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for specific dataset usage.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

This method ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research while providing proper citations.
