To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SSFD: Self-Supervised Feature Distance as an MR Image Reconstruction Quality Metric" by Philip M. Adamson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I will focus on the methods section for detailed dataset information.

In **section 2.1 (Dataset and Supervised Reconstruction Models)**, the authors explicitly mention the **fastMRI knee dataset**. They describe it as containing both sparse and fully acquired k-space data from a multi-coil MR scanner, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and application.

Next, I will look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. The fastMRI knee dataset is the primary dataset used for the experiments, and the authors provide specific details about how they split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, which is important for understanding its structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the fastMRI knee dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

Radiol Artif Intell, 2(1):e190007, Jan 2020.

Since the fastMRI knee dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the fastMRI knee dataset, ensuring that it is clear and complete for any further processing or review.
