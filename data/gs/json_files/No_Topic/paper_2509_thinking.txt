To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BAD: An assistant tool for making verses in Basque" by Manex Agirrezabal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the tool's purpose, but I need to look for specific datasets in the main body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the tradition of bertsolaritza and the need for a tool to assist in verse composition. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets here. I will continue to the **methodology** and **results sections** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the tool's development or evaluation.

Upon reviewing the **methodology**, the authors mention using a corpus of **3,500 Basque verse transcriptions** for their research. This corpus is crucial as it serves as the foundational dataset for training and evaluating the BAD tool. I will note this dataset and look for its citation.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the corpus of Basque verse transcriptions. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this corpus in the references, but they mention it as part of their ongoing work. Therefore, I will treat it as an internal dataset without an external citation.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, such as the **Basque Wordnet**, which is used for the synonym search feature. The authors reference a modified version of the Basque Wordnet developed by the IXA group at the University of the Basque Country. I will find the citation for this as well.

The citation for the Basque Wordnet is:
> Eli Pociello, Eneko Agirre, "Methodology and construction of WordNet", 2010.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries:

1. **Basque Verse Corpus**: A corpus containing 3,500 Basque verse transcriptions used for training and evaluating the BAD tool. (No external citation available)

2. **Basque Wordnet**: A lexical database used for synonym searches in the BAD tool.
   > Eli Pociello, Eneko Agirre, "Methodology and construction of WordNet", 2010.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
