To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-lingual RDF Thesauri Interlinking" by Tatiana Lesnikova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper evaluates machine translation for interlinking concepts from different thesauri, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation Setup)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors describe two experiments involving different thesauri:

1. **TheSoz Multilingual Thesaurus**: This is a SKOS-based thesaurus containing concepts in English, French, and German. The paper mentions that there are 8,223 concepts in total, with 8,206 concepts shared across the three languages.

2. **EuroVoc and AGROVOC Thesauri**: These are multilingual thesauri used in the second experiment, specifically for concepts in English and Chinese. The authors mention that they extracted 1,300 concepts for evaluation.

After identifying these datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **TheSoz Multilingual Thesaurus**, the citation is:
  > Zapilko, B., Schaible, J., Mayr, P., and Mathiak, B. (2013). *TheSoz: A SKOS Representation of the Thesaurus for the Social Sciences*. Semantic Web journal (SWJ), 4(3):257â€“263.

- For **EuroVoc**, the citation is:
  > EuroVoc. (n.d.). *EuroVoc Thesaurus*. Retrieved from http://eurovoc.europa.eu/

- For **AGROVOC**, the citation is:
  > AGROVOC. (n.d.). *AGROVOC Thesaurus*. Retrieved from http://aims.fao.org/standards/agrovoc/concept-scheme

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
