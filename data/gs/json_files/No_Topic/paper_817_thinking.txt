To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modality-Agnostic Learning for Radar-Lidar Fusion in Vehicle Detection" by Yu-Jhe Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** for further details. The authors discuss the importance of fusing different sensor modalities and reference existing datasets that utilize various sensors, but they specifically highlight the **Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset** as a benchmark for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets used in their evaluations. The authors state that they used the **Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset** for their experiments, providing specific details about the dataset, such as the number of sample pairs of Lidar and Radar frames, and how the data is split into training and testing sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Dan Barnes, Matthew Gadd, Paul Murcutt, Paul Newman, and Ingmar Posner. *The Oxford Radar Robotcar Dataset: A Radar Extension to the Oxford Robotcar Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 6433â€“6438, 2020.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the **Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset** is the primary dataset used in this research.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I follow the required format for documentation.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections to identify datasets.
2. Confirm the use of the **Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset**.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.
4. Document the dataset details for further processing.
