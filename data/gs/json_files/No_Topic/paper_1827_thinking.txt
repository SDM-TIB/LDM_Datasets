To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Warp to the Future: Joint Forecasting of Features and Feature Motion" by Josip Šarić et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the anticipation of scene development and mentions experiments conducted on the **Cityscapes dataset**. This indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experiments)**. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they performed experiments on the **Cityscapes dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for semantic urban scene understanding. 

I will then gather details about the **Cityscapes dataset** from the text. The paper mentions that it consists of a finely annotated subset with 2975 training images, 500 validation images, and 1525 test images. Each labeled image corresponds to the 20th frame of a 1.8-second long video clip (30 frames). This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Cityscapes dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3213–3223, 2016.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry for the **Cityscapes dataset**, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
