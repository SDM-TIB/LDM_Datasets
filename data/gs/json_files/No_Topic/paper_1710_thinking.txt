To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Demographic Word Embeddings for Racism Detection on Twitter" by Mohammed Hasanuzzaman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved classification accuracy over a "gold standard dataset," which suggests that there is a specific dataset they used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data Sets)**, where the authors describe their data collection process. Here, they mention two main datasets:

1. **Unlabeled Data Set**: This dataset consists of tweets collected using the Twitter streaming API over three months, resulting in approximately 17.2 million potentially racist tweets and 41.3 million potentially clean tweets. This dataset is crucial for training their models.

2. **Classification Data Set**: This dataset is a gold-standard dataset created through a crowdsourcing platform, consisting of 8,000 tweets that were annotated for racist intent. It includes a balanced distribution of tweets based on gender and age, which is essential for evaluating the classification models.

In the **methodology section**, the authors detail how they used these datasets to build demographic word embeddings and classify tweets. This reinforces the importance of both datasets in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are based on the authors' own data collection efforts. Instead, I will note the relevant details for each dataset:

- For the **Unlabeled Data Set**, the authors describe the collection process and the types of tweets included, but there is no formal citation since it is original data collected by the authors.

- For the **Classification Data Set**, the authors mention that it was created using a crowdsourcing platform (CrowdFlower) for annotation, but again, there is no formal citation for the dataset itself.

Since the datasets are original and not published in other works, I will summarize their details without formal citations but will ensure to include the context in which they were used.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that captures the essential information about each dataset, ready for review or further processing.
