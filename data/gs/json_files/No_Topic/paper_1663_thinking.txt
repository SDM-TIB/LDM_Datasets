To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MoRTy: Unsupervised Learning of Task-specialized Word Embeddings by Autoencoding" by Nils Rethmeier and Barbara Plank, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the MORTY method on various benchmark tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention evaluating MORTY on "18 publicly available benchmark tasks developed by Jastrzebski et al. (2017)." This indicates that there are specific datasets associated with these benchmark tasks, and I need to find their names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. The paper describes the evaluation of MORTY across 18 semantic benchmark tasks, which are categorized into word similarity, word analogy, and word categorization tasks. I will need to identify the datasets used for these tasks.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to a publicly available word embedding benchmark implementation developed by Jastrzebski et al. (2017) for their experiments. This implies that the datasets used for the 18 tasks are part of this benchmark.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the benchmark dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the benchmark tasks is:

- For the benchmark tasks developed by Jastrzebski et al. (2017), the citation is:
  > Stanislaw Jastrzebski, Damian Lesniak, and Wojciech Marian Czarnecki. *How to evaluate word embeddings? On importance of data efficiency and simple supervised tasks*. CoRR, abs/1702.02170, 2017.

Since the paper does not provide specific names for the datasets used in the 18 tasks, I will note that they are part of the benchmark tasks referenced.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the citation for the benchmark tasks, into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations as required.
