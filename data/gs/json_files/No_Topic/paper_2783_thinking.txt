To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Co-reference Resolution of Elided Subjects and Possessive Pronouns in Spanish-English Statistical Machine Translation" by Annette Rios and Don Tuggener, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of translating from pro-drop languages and the need for co-reference resolution, but they do not mention specific datasets yet.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Co-Reference Resolution for Null-Subjects in Spanish)** and **section 3 (Dummy Subjects and Co-Reference Annotations in MT)**. Here, the authors mention using the **AnCora treebank** for training their co-reference resolver. This is a crucial dataset for their experiments.

In **section 3.1 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention that they used the **Spanish-English part of the news commentary texts from 2011 (NC11)** as their corpus for experiments. They extracted a subset of 90,000 sentences from this corpus for training, tuning, and testing.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **AnCora treebank**, the citation is:
   > Mariona Taulé, Antònia Martí, and Marta Recasens. *AnCora: Multilevel Annotated Corpora for Catalan and Spanish*. In Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 08), pages 96–101, Marrakech, Morocco, 2008. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

2. For the **NC11 corpus**, the citation is:
   > The news commentary corpus is available from the OPUS website: http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
