To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Anlirika: an LSTM–CNN Flow Twister for Spoken Language Identification" by Andrei Shcherbakov et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a system submitted to the SIGTYP 2021 Shared Task, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the CMU Wilderness dataset as the largest multilingual spoken language identification dataset. This is a strong indication that this dataset is significant for their work.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. They mention that the training data is derived from the CMU Wilderness dataset, which consists of speech utterances from the Bible in approximately 700 languages. They also state that the validation and test sets were collected from multiple corpora, specifically mentioning the Common Voice dataset.

The details I need to extract include:
1. **CMU Wilderness Dataset**: Used for training, derived from the Bible, predominantly single speaker per language.
2. **Common Voice Dataset**: Used for validation and testing, includes multiple speakers and various recording conditions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CMU Wilderness Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alan W Black. 2019. *CMU Wilderness Multilingual Speech Dataset*. In ICASSP 2019-2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5971–5975. IEEE.

- For the **Common Voice Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rosana Ardila, Megan Branson, Kelly Davis, Michael Henretty, Michael Kohler, Josh Meyer, Reuben Morais, Lindsay Saunders, Francis M Tyers, and Gregor Weber. 2019. *Common Voice: A Massively Multilingual Speech Corpus*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.06670.

With these citations, I can now summarize the datasets used in the paper, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
