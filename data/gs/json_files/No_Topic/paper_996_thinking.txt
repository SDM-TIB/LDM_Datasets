To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SwatCS: Combining simple classifiers with estimated accuracy" by Sam Clark and Richard Wicentowski, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the SwatCS system and its application to sentiment analysis, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of analyzing Twitter data for sentiment analysis, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** (Section 3), where the authors describe the datasets used for their study. Here, they mention two main sources of data:

1. **Provided Training Data**: This is a manually-labeled set of approximately 15,000 tweets, labeled for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral, or objective). The authors reference Wilson et al. (2013) for this dataset.

2. **External Data**: The authors also mention using a dataset built by Go et al. (2009), which consists of 50,000 tweets, equally divided into positive and negative sentiment.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **provided training data**, the citation is:
  > Theresa Wilson, Zornitsa Kozareva, Preslav Nakov, Sara Rosenthal, Veselin Stoyanov, and Alan Ritter. *SemEval-2013 task 2: Sentiment analysis in Twitter*. In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEvalâ€™13.

- For the **external data** from Go et al. (2009), the citation is:
  > A. Go, R. Bhayani, and Huang. L. *Twitter sentiment classification using distant supervision*. Technical report, Stanford University.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

1. **Provided Training Data**: A collection of approximately 15,000 manually-labeled tweets for sentiment analysis.
2. **External Data**: A dataset of 50,000 tweets, with 25,000 labeled as positive and 25,000 as negative.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.
