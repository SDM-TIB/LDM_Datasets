To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compositional Mechanisms of Japanese Numeral Classifiers" by Miho Mano, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion** sections to see if the author references any datasets or data sources. The abstract primarily discusses theoretical frameworks and does not mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses numeral classifiers in Japanese and references various studies but does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will continue to the **main body of the paper**, particularly focusing on sections that might discuss empirical data or experiments.

As I progress through the paper, I will pay special attention to any sections that might detail experiments or analyses that could involve datasets. However, it appears that this paper is more theoretical and does not present any empirical studies or datasets. The references to previous studies and theoretical frameworks do not indicate the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of other authors. The references include various studies on classifiers and quantifiers but do not provide specific datasets that were used in the author's analysis.

Since the paper does not mention any datasets explicitly or provide citations for datasets, I conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. 

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in this research paper, and therefore, there are no citations to provide. This process highlights the importance of carefully reviewing each section of the paper to ensure that all potential sources of data are considered, even if the focus is primarily theoretical.
