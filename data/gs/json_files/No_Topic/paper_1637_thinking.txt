To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Construction et maintenance d’une ressource lexicale basées sur l’usage" by Laurie Planes, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a semantic search engine and a lexicon based on the Meaning-Text theory, but it does not directly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methods and results sections** to look for any references to datasets used in the research. The paper describes the construction and maintenance of a lexical resource, but it primarily focuses on the methodology rather than specific datasets.

I will also check the **conclusion and references sections** for any mentions of datasets or related works that might provide insights into the datasets used. However, the paper seems to focus on theoretical aspects and the development of a lexicon rather than empirical datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will note that there are no datasets to extract. If there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to retrieve full citations for each dataset from the references section, similar to how I would document datasets in other research papers.

In summary, after thoroughly reviewing the paper, I conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this research paper. If there were datasets, I would have documented them with their full citations for clarity and proper attribution.
