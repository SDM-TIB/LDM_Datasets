To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Annotated Corpus for Sentiment Analysis in Political News" by Gabriel Domingos de Arruda et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the corpus, indicating that it consists of news texts in Brazilian Portuguese, which suggests that the dataset is related to sentiment analysis in political news.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the need for annotated corpora for sentiment analysis, particularly in the context of political news. They mention the lack of resources in Brazilian Portuguese, which reinforces the significance of their dataset.

In the **materials and methods section**, the authors detail the process of data collection, specifying that they gathered news from public Twitter profiles and selected 131 news articles relevant to political candidates in Brazil. This section confirms the existence of a dataset, but I need to extract specific details about it.

The authors state that the corpus comprises **131 news articles**, segmented into **1,447 paragraphs**, with a total of **65,675 words**. They also mention that the paragraphs were annotated for two dimensions: target entity and polarity. This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

I will also check the **conclusion** section, where the authors summarize the contributions of their work, reiterating the availability of the corpus and gold standard for public use under a Creative Commons license. This indicates that the dataset is accessible for further research.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset as mentioned in the paper. The authors provide a link to access the dataset, which is important for proper citation.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Gabriel Domingos de Arruda, Norton Trevisan Roman, and Ana Maria Monteiro. *An Annotated Corpus for Sentiment Analysis in Political News*. In Proceedings of Symposium in Information and Human Language Technology, pages 101-110, Natal, RN, Brazil, November 4–7, 2015. Sociedade Brasileira de Computação.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset details, including the number of articles, paragraphs, words, and the dimensions of annotation, ensuring that I have all the necessary information to present the dataset accurately.
