To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Classification of Communicative Functions of Definiteness" by Archna Bhatia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and may mention datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the development of a supervised classifier and mention leveraging a cross-lingual definiteness annotation scheme and an annotated English corpus. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to locate their specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors describe the English definiteness corpus. They mention that this corpus consists of texts from multiple genres annotated with the Communicative Functions of Definiteness (CFD) scheme. The corpus includes 17 documents from TED talks, a presidential address, published news articles, and fictional narratives, totaling 13,860 words and 3,422 noun phrases (NPs).

The authors also provide a link to access the dataset: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ytsvetko/definiteness_corpus. This is crucial information for the dataset entry.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- **English definiteness corpus**:
  > Archna Bhatia, Mandy Simons, Lori Levin, Yulia Tsvetkov, Chris Dyer, and Jordan Bender. *A unified annotation scheme for the semantic/pragmatic components of definiteness*. In Proceedings of LREC, Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, 2014.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. 

In summary, the steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify the context of the datasets.
2. Focusing on the data section to find specific details about the datasets used.
3. Retrieving the full citation from the references section to ensure proper attribution.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on this information.
