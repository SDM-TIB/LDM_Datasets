To extract datasets from the proceedings of the Fifth Workshop on Speech and Language Processing for Assistive Technologies (SLPAT 2014), I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **introduction and individual paper sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The introduction provides context about the workshop and its focus, but I need to look at the specific papers for dataset information.

Next, I will examine the **titles and abstracts of each paper** listed in the table of contents. This will help me identify which papers might contain datasets relevant to assistive technologies. For instance, titles like "Speech recognition in Alzheimer’s disease with personal assistive robots" may suggest the use of specific datasets related to speech recognition.

I will then delve into the **full text of each paper** to find detailed descriptions of any datasets used. I will look for sections that typically discuss datasets, such as "Methodology," "Experiments," or "Data Collection." 

For example, if I find that the paper "Speech recognition in Alzheimer’s disease with personal assistive robots" mentions a dataset, I will note the specifics, such as the dataset's name, size, and any unique characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of each paper to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

If a dataset is derived from a previously published work, I will ensure to cite the original source. For instance, if the paper uses a well-known dataset like the "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)," I will find the appropriate citation for that dataset.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and properly attributed, making it useful for future research or reference.
