To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Real-life, French-accented Corpus of Air Traffic Control Communications" by Estelle Delpech et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss the corpus and its characteristics**. The abstract mentions the creation of the AIRBUS-ATC corpus, which is a key dataset in this paper. This indicates that I should look for detailed descriptions of this corpus throughout the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors explain the purpose of the AIRBUS-ATC corpus, which is to build a speech recognition system for Air Traffic Control communications. This section provides context but does not introduce additional datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Corpus description)**, where the authors provide a detailed account of the AIRBUS-ATC corpus. They mention that the corpus currently consists of **59 hours of transcribed English audio** and that it is intended to reach **100 hours**. The corpus includes various annotations, which are crucial for understanding its structure and potential applications.

In **section 2 (Existing ATC speech corpora)**, the authors reference other ATC datasets that are relevant to their work. They mention:

1. **NIST Air Traffic Control Corpus**: This corpus contains **70 hours of real-life ATC data** from three different US airports. It is noted as the best fit for their goals, although it lacks non-native data.

2. **ATCOSIM Corpus**: A smaller corpus containing **10.7 hours** of non-prompted clean ATC speech.

3. **HIWIRE Corpus**: Contains **8,100 utterances** of cockpit communication, but is limited in scope.

4. **VOCALISE Dataset**: Contains **150 hours** of military ATC data, but is unavailable.

5. **nnMTAC Corpus**: Contains **24 hours** of real-life, non-native ATC data, but is also unavailable.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **NIST Air Traffic Control Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Godfrey, J. (1994). *Air Traffic Control Complete*. LDC94S14A. Web Download. Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium.

- For the **ATCOSIM Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Hofbauer, K., Petrik, S., and Hering, H. (2008). *The ATCOSIM Corpus of Non-Prompted Clean Air Traffic Control Speech*. In Proceedings of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC).

- For the **HIWIRE Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Segura, J. C., Ehrette, T., Potamianos, A., Fohr, D., Illina, I., Breton, P.-A., Clot, V., Gemello, R., Matassoni, M., and Maragos, P. (2007). *The HIWIRE database, a noisy and non-native English speech corpus for cockpit communication*. Online. http://www.hiwire.org

- For the **VOCALISE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Graglia, L., Favennec, B., and Arnoux, A. (2005). *Vocalise: Assessing the impact of data link technology on the R/T channel*. The 24th Digital Avionics Systems Conference, Vol. 1.

- For the **nnMTAC Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Pigeon, S., Shen, W., and van Leeuwen, D. (2007). *Design and characterization of the non-native military ATC corpus*. 

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
