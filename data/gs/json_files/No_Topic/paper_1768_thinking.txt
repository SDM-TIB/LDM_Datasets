To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InstaHideâ€™s Sample Complexity When Mixing Two Private Images," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. In the introduction, the authors mention that the InstaHide method shows promising results on several datasets, specifically **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **ImageNet**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss the InstaHide challenge, which involves using a public dataset (ImageNet) and a private dataset consisting of 100 private images. However, they do not provide specific details about the private dataset, as it is likely proprietary or not publicly available.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Deng, L. (2012). The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research. *IEEE Signal Processing Magazine*, 29(6), 141-142. doi:10.1109/MSP.2012.2211477.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:

4. **ImageNet Dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper citations for future reference or use.
