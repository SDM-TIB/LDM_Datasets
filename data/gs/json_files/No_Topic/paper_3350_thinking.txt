To extract datasets from the research paper presented at EMNLP 2013, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by scanning the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used. I will look for phrases that indicate the presence of datasets, such as "we used the following datasets" or "our experiments were conducted on."

Next, I will examine the **methodology or experiments section** of the paper. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will look for specific dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., size, number of samples, types of annotations).

If the paper includes a dedicated **datasets section**, I will focus on that as it will likely provide the most comprehensive information about each dataset. I will note down the names, purposes, and any unique characteristics of the datasets mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it allows for proper attribution and enables others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if I find a dataset named "MCTest," I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Matthew Richardson, Christopher J.C. Burges, and Erin Renshaw. *MCTest: A Challenge Dataset for the Open-Domain Machine Comprehension of Text*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 193â€“202, 2013.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and organized summary of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further analysis or sharing.
