To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discriminative Feature-to-Point Matching in Image-Based Localization" by Michael Donoser and Dieter Schmalstieg, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction and experiments sections are more likely to contain specific dataset names and details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the prevalent approaches in image-based localization and mention the use of 3D point clouds obtained from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines. However, they do not specify any datasets here.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they use two widely known datasets in the field of image-based localization: **Dubrovnik** and **Rome**. The authors provide some statistics about these datasets, including the number of images, points, and descriptors, which is crucial for understanding their scope.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the datasets as follows:

- For the **Dubrovnik dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Irschara, C. Zach, J. M. Frahm, and H. Bischof. *From structure-from-motion point clouds to fast location recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2599–2606, 2009.

- For the **Rome dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Li, N. Snavely, and D. Huttenlocher. *Location recognition using prioritized feature matching*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 791–804, 2010.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Dubrovnik Dataset**: Contains approximately 6,000 images, 2 million points, and 10 million descriptors, obtained from Flickr and processed through a SfM pipeline.
2. **Rome Dataset**: Comprises around 15,000 images, 4 million points, and 21 million descriptors, also sourced from Flickr and reconstructed using a SfM pipeline.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citations for both datasets ready for inclusion in any structured output or documentation. This thorough approach ensures that I capture all relevant details about the datasets mentioned in the paper.
