To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Neural Verb Lexicon Model with Source-side Syntactic Context for String-to-Tree Machine Translation" by Maria Nadejde et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of verb translation in machine translation systems, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Verb Translation Analysis)**, where the authors describe their experiments and the data used. Here, they mention that the string-to-tree system is trained on all available data from WMT15, which is a key dataset for their analysis. They also specify that the evaluation test set consists of newstest2013, newstest2014, and newstest2015, totaling 8,172 sentences. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

In **section 4 (Verb Lexicon Model)**, the authors provide details about the training and evaluation data. They mention that the models are trained on all parallel training data available at WMT15 and a development set of 2,000 sentences for early stopping. This reinforces the importance of the WMT15 dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **WMT15 Dataset**: The citation for the WMT15 dataset is:
   > Bojar, O., Chatterjee, R., Federmann, C., Haddow, B., Huck, M., Hokamp, C., Koehn, P., Logacheva, V., Monz, C., Negri, M., Post, M., Scarton, C., Specia, L., & Turchi, M. (2015). Findings of the 2015 workshop on statistical machine translation. In Proceedings of the Tenth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, Lisbon, Portugal, September 2015, pp. 1–46.

2. **newstest2013 Dataset**: The citation for the newstest2013 dataset is:
   > Bojar, O., Chatterjee, R., Federmann, C., Haddow, B., Huck, M., Hokamp, C., Koehn, P., Logacheva, V., Monz, C., Negri, M., Post, M., Scarton, C., Specia, L., & Turchi, M. (2013). Findings of the 2013 workshop on statistical machine translation. In Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, Sofia, Bulgaria, August 2013, pp. 1–12.

3. **newstest2014 Dataset**: The citation for the newstest2014 dataset is:
   > Bojar, O., Chatterjee, R., Federmann, C., Haddow, B., Huck, M., Hokamp, C., Koehn, P., Logacheva, V., Monz, C., Negri, M., Post, M., Scarton, C., Specia, L., & Turchi, M. (2014). Findings of the 2014 workshop on statistical machine translation. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, Baltimore, Maryland, USA, June 2014, pp. 1–12.

4. **newstest2015 Dataset**: The citation for the newstest2015 dataset is:
   > Bojar, O., Chatterjee, R., Federmann, C., Haddow, B., Huck, M., Hokamp, C., Koehn, P., Logacheva, V., Monz, C., Negri, M., Post, M., Scarton, C., Specia, L., & Turchi, M. (2015). Findings of the 2015 workshop on statistical machine translation. In Proceedings of the Tenth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, Lisbon, Portugal, September 2015, pp. 1–46.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
