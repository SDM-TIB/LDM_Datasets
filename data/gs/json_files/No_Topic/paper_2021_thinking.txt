To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Phone-ing it in: Towards Flexible, Multi-Modal Language Model Training using Phonetic Representations of Data," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions initial experiments using Swahili and Kinyarwanda data, indicating that these languages are associated with specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of data scarcity for low-resource languages. They mention various projects and datasets, including the **Bloom software project** and the **ChoCo corpus**. I will note these as potential datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors detail their use of the following datasets:

1. **Language Modeling Data for Swahili**: This dataset is referenced as being hosted on Hugging Face and is crucial for their Swahili language model training.
   
2. **ALFFA Speech Dataset**: This dataset is used for processing audio files and original text transcriptions for Swahili.

3. **Common Voice Kinyarwanda 6.1 Subset**: This dataset is mentioned as a significant resource for Kinyarwanda audio and text data.

4. **MasakhaNER Dataset**: This dataset is used for fine-tuning the Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Language Modeling Data for Swahili**, the citation is:
  > Shivachi Casper Shikali and Mokhosi Refuoe. *Language modeling data for Swahili*. 2019.

- For the **ALFFA Speech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hadrien Gelas, Laurent Besacier, and Francois Pellegrino. *Developments of Swahili resources for an automatic speech recognition system*. In SLTU - Workshop on Spoken Language Technologies for Under-Resourced Languages, 2012.

- For the **Common Voice Kinyarwanda 6.1 Subset**, the citation is:
  > Rosana Ardila et al. *Common voice: A massively-multilingual speech corpus*. CoRR, abs/1912.06670, 2019.

- For the **MasakhaNER Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Adelani et al. *MasakhaNER: Named Entity Recognition for African Languages*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 9:1116â€“1131, 2021.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference or processing.
