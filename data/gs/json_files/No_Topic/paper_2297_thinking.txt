To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stylistic Approaches to Predicting Reddit Popularity in Diglossia" by Huikai Chua, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper, as these sections typically provide insights into the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions that the study uses data from Singaporean and British subreddits, which indicates that there are datasets related to Reddit posts.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Data)**, where the author describes the data collection process. Here, the author specifies that data was scraped from two subreddits: the Singaporean subreddit and the United Kingdom subreddit. This section provides crucial details about the datasets, including the time frame of the data collection (from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2019) and the criteria for post selection (posts with more than 101 characters).

In **section 4.1 (Data collection)**, the author explicitly states the two datasets:

1. **Singaporean subreddit dataset**: This dataset consists of posts from the Singapore subreddit, which features a distinctive linguistic style known as "Singlish." The dataset includes posts from approximately 300,000 participants.

2. **United Kingdom subreddit dataset**: This dataset comprises posts from the UK subreddit, which has around 400,000 participants. The author notes that while the population sizes of Singapore and the UK differ significantly, the subreddit sizes are comparable.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are not formal publications but rather collections of Reddit posts, so I will focus on documenting them based on the information provided in the paper.

The citations for the relevant papers that describe methodologies or concepts used in the analysis are as follows:

- For the methodology related to community style endorsement, I will cite:
  > Tran, T., & Ostendorf, M. (2016). Characterizing the language of online communities and its relation to community reception. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 1030–1035). Austin, Texas: Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the work that inspired the annotation procedure, I will cite:
  > Fang, H., Cheng, H., & Ostendorf, M. (2016). Learning latent local conversation modes for predicting comment endorsement in online discussions. In Proceedings of The Fourth International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (pp. 55–64). Austin, TX, USA: Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names of the datasets along with their descriptions and relevant citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
