To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cycle-Consistent GAN Front-End to Improve ASR Robustness to Perturbed Speech" by Sri Harsha Dumpala et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on "spontaneously generated laughter-speech and creaky voice datasets," which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. They refer to two specific datasets:

1. **AMI Meeting Corpus**: This dataset is noted for its dedicated annotations and time-stamps for speech that is perturbed with emotions and voice quality. It is important to note that the authors used data collected from 40 female and 30 male speakers for their experiments.

2. **Buckeye Corpus of Conversational Speech**: Similar to the AMI corpus, this dataset also contains annotations and is used for analyzing speech affected by emotions and voice quality.

In the experiments section, the authors provide details about the number of utterances considered for training and testing, which further confirms the relevance of these datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **AMI Meeting Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Iain McCowan, Jean Carletta, W Kraaij, S Ashby, S Bourban, M Flynn, M Guillemot, T Hain, J Kadlec, V Karaiskos, et al. *The AMI Meeting Corpus*. In Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Methods and Techniques in Behavioral Research, volume 88, page 100, 2005.

- For the **Buckeye Corpus of Conversational Speech**, the citation is:
  > Mark A Pitt, Laura Dilley, Keith Johnson, Scott Kiesling, William Raymond, Elizabeth Hume, and Eric Fosler-Lussier. *Buckeye Corpus of Conversational Speech (2nd release)*. Columbus, OH: Department of Psychology, Ohio State University (Distributor), 2007.

Having gathered this information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
