To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mieux utiliser BERT pour la détection d’évènements à partir de peu d’exemples" by Aboubacar Tuo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of BERT for few-shot event detection, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of event extraction and the need for annotated corpora. This indicates that they likely reference specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimentation section** (section 3), where the authors describe their evaluation framework. They mention using the **FewEvent corpus**, which is crucial for my dataset extraction. I will look for details about this corpus, such as its size, structure, and the types of events it contains.

The paper states that the FewEvent corpus consists of **70,852 event mentions** in English, categorized into **100 types**. They also mention the specific splits used for training, validation, and testing, which is important for understanding how the dataset is utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FewEvent corpus. The authors cite Deng et al. (2020) as the source of this dataset. I will extract the full citation from the references:

- For the **FewEvent corpus**, the citation is:
  > Deng, S., Zhang, N., Kang, J., Zhang, Y., Zhang, W., & Chen, H. (2020). Meta-Learning with Dynamic-Memory-Based Prototypical Network for Few-Shot Event Detection. In Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, pp. 151–159, Houston TX USA: ACM. DOI: 10.1145/3336191.3371796.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the FewEvent corpus, ensuring to include all relevant details and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
