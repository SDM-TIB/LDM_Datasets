To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent Trees for Coreference Resolution" by Eraldo Rezende Fernandes et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that empirical evaluation is performed on the **multilingual unrestricted coreference CoNLL-2012 Shared Task data sets**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific details about the datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 7.1, the authors describe the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task data sets, which include three languages: **Arabic, Chinese, and English**. They mention that these datasets are provided by the OntoNotes project and consist of training, development, and test subsets.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following:

- For the **CoNLL-2012 Shared Task**, the citation is:
  > Pradhan, Sameer, Alessandro Moschitti, Nianwen Xue, Olga Uryupina, and Yuchen Zhang. *CoNLL-2012 Shared Task: Modeling multilingual unrestricted coreference in OntoNotes*. In Joint Conference on EMNLP and CoNLL—Shared Task, CoNLL’12, pages 1–40, Jeju Island, 2012.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as required.

1. **CoNLL-2012 Shared Task Data Sets**: This dataset is used for modeling multilingual unrestricted coreference resolution and includes three languages: Arabic, Chinese, and English. It consists of training, development, and test subsets, and is provided by the OntoNotes project.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
