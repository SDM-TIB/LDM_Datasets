To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Vector Representations for Unsupervised Automatic Short Answer Grading" by Oliver Adams et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their technique across two datasets from different domains, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Data section (Section 4)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **CSDataset**: This dataset is derived from an undergraduate computer science course and includes 87 questions along with model answers and student responses from 31 students. The reference for this dataset is:
   > Michael Mohler, Razvan C. Bunescu, and Rada Mihalcea. *Learning to grade short answer questions using semantic similarity measures and dependency graph alignments*. In ACL, pages 752â€“762, 2011.

2. **RCDataset**: This dataset is from a high-school English reading comprehension task for Class XII students in India. It consists of 14 questions, each with recorded responses from 58 students, and includes fine-grained scoring schemes. The authors intend to share this dataset for future research. The citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is important to note that it is intended for community sharing.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their descriptions and any relevant details provided in the paper, such as the number of questions, responses, and the context in which they were used.

Finally, I will compile the full citations for each dataset, ensuring that they are accurately represented for future reference. This will include the citation for the CSDataset and a note about the RCDataset's availability for research purposes.

With this information gathered, I will be ready to format the dataset entries according to the required structure for further processing or review.
