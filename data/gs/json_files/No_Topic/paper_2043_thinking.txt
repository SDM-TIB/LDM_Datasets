To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting the Compositionality of Nominal Compounds: Giving Word Embeddings a Hard Time" by Silvio Cordeiro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract states that the authors present a "large-scale multilingual evaluation of DSMs for predicting the degree of semantic compositionality of nominal compounds on 4 datasets for English and French." This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** to gather more context about these datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of evaluating distributional semantic models (DSMs) and hints at the datasets used for this evaluation.

I will then focus on **section 3.2 (Compositionality Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **Reddy Dataset**: This dataset contains compositionality judgments for 90 compounds, with scores ranging from 0 (idiomatic) to 5 (literal). The dataset was collected using Mechanical Turk.
   
2. **Reddy++ Dataset**: An extension of the Reddy dataset, it includes an additional 90 nominal compounds, bringing the total to 180 entries. The scores also range from 0 to 5 and were collected similarly through Mechanical Turk.

3. **Farahmand Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,042 English compounds extracted from Wikipedia, with binary non-compositionality judgments provided by four experts. The judgments are used to classify compounds as either compositional or non-compositional.

4. **FR-comp Dataset**: A new resource created for this evaluation, it contains 180 adjective-noun and noun-adjective compounds in French, with compositionality scores collected through crowdsourcing.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Reddy Dataset**:

- For the **Farahmand Dataset**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
