To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Inference on Deep Neural Networks by Dynamic Representations and Decision Gates" by Mohammad Saeed Shafiee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or utilized in the experiments. The abstract mentions experimental results on the **CIFAR10 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their evaluations.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The introduction discusses various methods and architectures but does not explicitly name additional datasets beyond CIFAR10. Therefore, I will focus on the **methodology** and **results sections** for more details.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their experiments with two different network architectures, ResNet-101 and DenseNet-201, both of which are trained on the **CIFAR10 dataset**. This confirms that CIFAR10 is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors present experimental results comparing the performance of their proposed d-gate modules on the ResNet-101 and DenseNet-201 architectures, again referencing the **CIFAR10 dataset**. There are no additional datasets mentioned in the results or discussion.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR10 dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for CIFAR10 within the text. I will use a commonly accepted citation for the CIFAR10 dataset, which is:

- **CIFAR10 Dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2010. Available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

Since CIFAR10 is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for CIFAR10, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
