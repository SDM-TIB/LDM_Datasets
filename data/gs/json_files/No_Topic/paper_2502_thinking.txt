To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diversity Augmented Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Multimodal Image-to-Image Translation," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention various image-to-image translation tasks and refer to datasets like "cat→dog," "Yosemite summer→winter," "Alps seasonal transfer," "image weather conditions," "AFHQ," and "WikiArts." This gives me a preliminary list of datasets to look for.

I will then focus on the **experiments** section, specifically looking for any subsection that discusses the datasets used. The authors explicitly list the datasets they evaluated their method on, which includes:

1. **Yosemite Summer→Winter Dataset**: Referenced as a dataset used for image-to-image translation tasks.
2. **Dog→Cat Dataset**: Another dataset mentioned for two-domain translation tasks.
3. **Alps Seasonal Transfer Dataset**: Used for multi-domain translation tasks.
4. **Image Weather Conditions Dataset**: Also used for multi-domain translation tasks.
5. **AFHQ Dataset**: Mentioned in the context of multi-domain image translation.
6. **WikiArts Dataset**: Another dataset used for evaluation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide complete information for future researchers.

The citations I will look for include:

- For the **Yosemite Summer→Winter Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhu, J.-Y., Park, T., Isola, P., & Efros, A. A. (2017). Unpaired image-to-image translation using cycle-consistent adversarial networks. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017.

- For the **Dog→Cat Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Alps Seasonal Transfer Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Image Weather Conditions Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **AFHQ Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **WikiArts Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhu, J.-Y., Park, T., Isola, P., & Efros, A. A. (2017). Toward multimodal image-to-image translation. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 30 (NeurIPS), 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or processing.
