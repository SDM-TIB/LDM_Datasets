To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lexical access via a simple co-occurrence network" by Gemma Bel-Enguix and Michael Zock, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the construction of a co-occurrence network based on Wikipedia abstracts, which suggests that the dataset used is derived from Wikipedia.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. The authors describe building a co-occurrence graph using "the entire set of Wikipedia's abstracts, i.e. almost 4 million documents." This indicates that the dataset consists of Wikipedia abstracts, which is a significant corpus for their research.

I will also check the **conclusion and references sections** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors cite any specific datasets or resources that were used in their work. However, the primary dataset appears to be the Wikipedia abstracts, as there are no other datasets explicitly mentioned in the text.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset used:

- **Wikipedia Abstracts**: The citation for the dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it can be referenced as:
  > Wikipedia contributors. *Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia*. Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. [https://www.wikipedia.org](https://www.wikipedia.org) (Accessed: [insert date]).

Since the authors did not provide a formal citation for the Wikipedia dataset, I will use the general citation format for Wikipedia.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Wikipedia abstracts as the primary dataset used in their research. This will be ready for further processing or review.
