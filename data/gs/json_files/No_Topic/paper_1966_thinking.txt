To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Depth-Aware Stereo Video Retargeting" by Bing Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the challenges of stereo video retargeting but does not specify any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the context of stereo video and mentions the need for effective retargeting methods, but again, no datasets are explicitly named.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this case, I will focus on the **performance comparison** subsection, which often includes details about the datasets employed in the experiments. 

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors mention testing their method on videos from the **CVW dataset** (Consistent Volumetric Warping), which is a dataset used for stereo video retargeting. However, they do not provide a detailed description of this dataset within the paper.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the **CVW dataset**, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here, I will look for the entry that corresponds to the CVW dataset. The citation is as follows:
> S.-S. Lin, C.-H. Lin, Y.-H. Kuo, and T.-Y. Lee. *Consistent volumetric warping using floating boundaries for stereoscopic video retargeting*. IEEE Trans. Circuits Syst. Video Technol., 8, 2015.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors also refer to videos from the **PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge (VOC)** dataset for comparisons with 2D image/video retargeting methods. I will also retrieve the citation for this dataset:
> M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2007 (VOC2007) Results*. http://www.pascal-network.org/challenges/VOC/voc2007/workshop/index.html.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CVW Dataset**: Used for performance comparison in stereo video retargeting.
   - Citation: S.-S. Lin, C.-H. Lin, Y.-H. Kuo, and T.-Y. Lee. *Consistent volumetric warping using floating boundaries for stereoscopic video retargeting*. IEEE Trans. Circuits Syst. Video Technol., 8, 2015.

2. **PASCAL VOC Dataset**: Used for comparisons with 2D image/video retargeting methods.
   - Citation: M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2007 (VOC2007) Results*. http://www.pascal-network.org/challenges/VOC/voc2007/workshop/index.html.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
