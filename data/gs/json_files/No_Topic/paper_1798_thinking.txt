To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Pipeline for Zero-Shot Data-to-Text Generation," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments on "two major triple-to-text datasets—WebNLG and E2E," which indicates that these datasets are significant for the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. The **experiments section** (section 5.5) explicitly lists the datasets:

1. **WebNLG Dataset**: The paper states that the WebNLG dataset contains RDF triples from DBPedia and their crowdsourced descriptions. It also mentions that they used version 1.4 of the dataset for comparability to prior work.

2. **E2E Dataset**: The E2E dataset is described as containing restaurant recommendations in the form of attribute-value pairs. The authors note that they used a cleaned version of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **WebNLG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Claire Gardent, Anastasia Shimorina, Shashi Narayan, and Laura Perez-Beltrachini. *The WebNLG challenge: Generating text from RDF data*. In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Natural Language Generation, pages 124–133, Santiago de Compostela, Spain, 2017.

- For the **E2E Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jekaterina Novikova, Ondrej Dušek, and Verena Rieser. *The E2E Dataset: New Challenges for End-to-End Generation*. In Proceedings of the 18th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue, pages 201–206, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured the details necessary for future reference or analysis. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any critical information regarding the datasets used in the research.
