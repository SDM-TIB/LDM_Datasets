To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SCAR: Sentence Compression using Autoencoders for Reconstruction" by Chanakya Malireddy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the SCAR framework and its performance on benchmark datasets, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using the **annotated Gigaword corpus** for training and also refer to the **DUC-2003** and **DUC-2004** shared tasks for testing. This indicates that these are the primary datasets utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will gather details about each dataset:

1. **Annotated Gigaword Corpus**: The authors state that they used the reference section of this corpus, which contains a large number of samples for training their model. The paper mentions that they only considered sentences of a specific length (between 15 and 40 words) for training.

2. **DUC-2003 and DUC-2004**: These datasets are mentioned as part of the evaluation process. They consist of news articles paired with reference summaries, which are used to assess the performance of the SCAR model.

Next, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Annotated Gigaword Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Alexander M. Rush, Sumit Chopra, and Jason Weston. *A neural attention model for abstractive sentence summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 379–389, Lisbon, Portugal. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **DUC-2003 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Paul Over, Hoa Dang, and Donna Harman. *DUC in context*. Information Processing & Management, 43(6):1506–1520, 2007.

- For the **DUC-2004 dataset**, the citation is the same as for DUC-2003, as they are part of the same series of shared tasks.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
