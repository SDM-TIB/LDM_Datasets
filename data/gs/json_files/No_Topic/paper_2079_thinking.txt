To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constructing Web-Accessible Semantic Role Labels and Frames for Japanese as Additions to the NPCMJ Parsed Corpus" by Koichi Takeuchi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors are adding frame information and semantic role labels to the NINJAL Parsed Corpus of Modern Japanese (NPCMJ), which suggests that this corpus is a primary dataset.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference several existing corpora related to semantic roles and frames for Japanese, including the NPCMJ, which is described as a freely available web-accessible treebank. This indicates that the NPCMJ is a significant dataset for their research.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the annotation process for semantic roles and frames, but they do not introduce any new datasets beyond the NPCMJ. They mention that the NPCMJ is being enhanced with semantic role labels and frames, which reinforces its importance as the dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The NPCMJ is cited as follows:
- NINJAL. (2016). NINJAL Parsed Corpus of Modern Japanese. (Version 1.0). Technical report, National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics. Available at: http://npcmj.ninjal.ac.jp/interfaces/ (accessed 2019/11/30).

Additionally, the authors reference other corpora that are relevant to their work, such as:
- Kyoto Corpus (Kawahara et al., 2002).
- NAIST Corpus (Iida et al., 2007).
- EDR (EDR, 1995).
- GDA (Hashida, 2005).
- Japanese FrameNet (Ohara et al., 2006).
- BCCWJ-PT (Takeuchi et al., 2015).

I will compile the full citations for these datasets as well:

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured the relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
