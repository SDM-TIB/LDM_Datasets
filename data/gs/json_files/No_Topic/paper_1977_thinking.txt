To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topical Key Concept Extraction from Folksonomy" by Han Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. In this case, it discusses the use of folksonomy data from Douban.com, which is a significant clue that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the dataset is crawled from Douban.com Movie, containing data on the top 250 movies with 1760 tags assigned by users. This section provides specific details about the dataset, including the number of movies and tags, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Douban.com dataset. Since the dataset is derived from a website rather than a traditional dataset publication, I will note the website's name and the context in which it was used. The citation will look something like this:
> Douban.com. *Douban Movie*. Accessed June 2012. Available at: http://movie.douban.com

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset's name, description, and citation, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
