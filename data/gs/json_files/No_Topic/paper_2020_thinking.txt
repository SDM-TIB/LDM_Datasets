To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unified Encoding of Structures in Transition Systems" by Tao Ji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **PTB (Penn Treebank)** and **UD (Universal Dependencies)** datasets, which suggests that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In the section discussing experiments, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the **English Penn Treebank (PTB 3.0)** and **Universal Dependencies (UD 2.2)**. This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized in their research.

I will then check the **appendices** for any additional details or statistics about the datasets. The appendix provides statistics for both datasets, confirming their relevance and usage in the experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **Penn Treebank (PTB)**, the citation is:
   > Marcus, M. P., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank. *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

2. For the **Universal Dependencies (UD)**, the citation is:
   > Nivre, J., de Lhoneux, M., Hajič, J., & Zeman, D. (2018). Universal Dependencies 2.2. *LINDAT/CLARIN digital library at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, Charles University, Prague*.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary information is included for each dataset.
