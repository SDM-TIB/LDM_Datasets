To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Facial Emotion Distribution Learning by Exploiting Low-Rank Label Correlations Locally" by Xiuyi Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on benchmark facial expression datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two datasets: **s-JAFFE** and **SBU 3DFE**. I will extract the relevant details about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments.

1. **s-JAFFE Dataset**: This dataset consists of 213 grayscale images of 10 Japanese female models. Each image is scored by 60 people on six basic emotions (happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, anger, and disgust) using a five-level scale. The average score for each emotion is used to represent the emotion distribution.

2. **SBU 3DFE Dataset**: This dataset contains 2500 images, and the emotion distribution for each image is obtained using the same method as for the s-JAFFE dataset. Each image in this dataset is also represented by a 243-dimensional feature vector extracted using the Local Binary Patterns (LBP) method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the s-JAFFE dataset is extended from the JAFFE dataset, and the SBU 3DFE dataset is extended from the BU 3DFE dataset. I will look for the original papers that describe these datasets:

- For the **JAFFE dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Lyons, S. Akamatsu, M. Kamachi, and J. Gyoba. *Coding facial expressions with Gabor wavelets*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, pages 200–205, 2002.

- For the **BU 3DFE dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lijun Yin, Xiaozhou Wei, Yi Sun, Jun Wang, and Matthew J. Rosato. *A 3D facial expression database for facial behavior research*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, pages 211–216, 2006.

With these citations, I now have the necessary information to describe each dataset accurately.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
