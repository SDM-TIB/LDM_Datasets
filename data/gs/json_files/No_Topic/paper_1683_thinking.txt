To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning brain regions via large-scale online structured sparse dictionary-learning" by Elvis Dohmatob et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on a "large public dataset," which indicates that a dataset is indeed used, but I need to identify its name and details.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup, stating that they used task fMRI data from "500 subjects from the HCP – Human Connectome Project – dataset." This is a clear indication of the dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Human Connectome Project dataset. The citation is typically provided in a format that includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year. 

The citation for the Human Connectome Project dataset is:
> D. van Essen et al. "The Human Connectome Project: A data acquisition perspective." In: NeuroImage 62 (2012).

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset**: This dataset consists of task fMRI data from 500 subjects, which was acquired to assess major domains thought to sample the diversity of neural systems of interest in functional connectomics.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
