To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structure-Augmented Text Representation Learning for Efficient Knowledge Graph Completion" by Bo Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to their work. 

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention achieving state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks and a zero-shot dataset for link prediction. This indicates that there are specific datasets used for evaluation.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find a table summarizing the statistics of benchmark datasets, which includes:

1. **WN18RR**: A link prediction dataset derived from WordNet, consisting of English phrases and their semantic relations.
2. **FB15k-237**: A subset of Freebase, consisting of real-world named entities and their relations.
3. **UMLS**: A small knowledge graph containing medical semantic entities and their relations.
4. **NELL-One**: A few-shot link prediction dataset derived from NELL, where the relations in the dev/test set never appear in the train set.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
