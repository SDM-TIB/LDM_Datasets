To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Chebyshev Basis in Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-based Action Recognition" by Hichem Sahbi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method on skeleton-based action recognition, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors provide context about the importance of skeleton-based action recognition and may mention specific datasets used in their experiments. I will look for any explicit references to datasets.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, particularly **section 5**, I will focus on the details provided about the datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention two datasets:

1. **SBU Interaction Dataset**: This dataset consists of 282 moving skeleton sequences performed by two interacting individuals across 8 categories. Each sequence includes 3D coordinates of 15 joints.

2. **First-Person Hand Action (FPHA) Dataset**: This dataset includes 1175 skeletons belonging to 45 action categories performed by 6 individuals in various scenarios. Each skeleton has 21 hand joints with 3D coordinates.

I will also check the **implementation details** section for any additional information about how these datasets were processed or evaluated.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For the **SBU Interaction Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yun, K., Honorio, J., Chattopadhyay, D., Berg, T. L., & Samaras, D. (2012). Two-person interaction detection using body pose features and multiple instance learning. In *IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop*.

- For the **First-Person Hand Action (FPHA) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Garcia-Hernando, G., Yuan, S., Baek, S., & Kim, T.-K. (2018). First-Person Hand Action Benchmark with RGB-D Videos and 3D Hand Pose Annotations. In *CVPR*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing. This systematic approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
