To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Accurate Pulmonary Nodule Detection in Computed Tomography Images Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" by Jia Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **LUng Nodule Analysis 2016 (LUNA16) Challenge**, which indicates that this is a dataset used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **introduction** and **experimental results sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of early detection of pulmonary cancer and mention the use of CT scans, but I need to confirm the dataset details.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors state that they evaluated their CAD system on the LUNA16 challenge dataset, which is derived from the **LIDC-IDRI** database. They mention that the LIDC-IDRI dataset contains a total of 1018 CT scans, but after filtering, they used 888 scans for their experiments. This gives me the necessary information about the dataset used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **LUNA16 Challenge**, the citation is:
   > A. A. A. Setio, A. Traverso, T. Bel, et al. *Validation, comparison, and combination of algorithms for automatic detection of pulmonary nodules in computed tomography images: the LUNA16 challenge*. arXiv:1612.08012, 2016.

2. For the **LIDC-IDRI dataset**, the citation is:
   > S.G. Armato, G. McLennan, L. Bidaut, et al. *The lung image database consortium (lidc) and image database resource initiative (idri): a completed reference database of lung nodules on ct scans*. Medical Physics, 38(2):915â€“931, 2011.

With these citations, I have the complete information needed to describe the datasets used in the paper. I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
