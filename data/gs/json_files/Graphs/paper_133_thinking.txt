To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal-RCNN: Universal Object Detector via Transferable Graph R-CNN" by Hang Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple object detection benchmarks, which suggests that specific datasets are used for evaluation. The introduction further elaborates on the datasets, specifically mentioning **MSCOCO**, **Visual Genome (VG)**, and **ADE** as the primary datasets utilized in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section, the authors provide details about the datasets used:
1. **MSCOCO**: A widely-used object detection dataset with 80 object classes, containing 118K training images, 5K validation images, and 20K unannotated testing images.
2. **Visual Genome (VG)**: A large-scale object detection benchmark with thousands of object classes, using 88K images for training and 5K for testing.
3. **ADE**: A segmentation dataset with 445 classes, using 20K images for training and 1K for testing.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MSCOCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., DollÃ¡r, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context. In *European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)*.

- For **Visual Genome**, the citation is:
  > Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Kalantidis, Y., Li, L.-J., Shamma, D. A., Bernstein, M., & Fei-Fei, L. (2016). Visual genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations. *International Journal of Computer Vision*.

- For **ADE**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, B., Zhao, H., Puig, X., Fidler, S., Barriuso, A., & Torralba, A. (2017). Scene parsing through ADE20K dataset. In *CVPR*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
