To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction with Structure-Based Deep Fusion Inference" by Derek Jones et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors performed experiments with the **PDBBind 2016 dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will examine the **Materials and Methods** section, specifically the **Data** subsection, where the authors provide detailed information about the **PDBBind database**. They describe it as a curated subset of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and mention that the 2016 edition consists of 13,308 protein-ligand binding complexes. This section confirms that the PDBBind dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **Results** or **Discussion** sections. However, the focus remains on the PDBBind dataset throughout the paper, and no other datasets are explicitly mentioned.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PDBBind dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> wwPDB consortium (2019). Protein data bank: the single global archive for 3D macromolecular structure data. Nucleic Acids Res., 47(D1), D520â€“D528.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **PDBBind 2016 Dataset**: This dataset is a curated collection of protein-ligand binding complexes used for evaluating binding affinity prediction models. It consists of 13,308 complexes, with specific subsets for refined and core complexes.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for the dataset used in the research paper.
