To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Context-Aware Short-Term Interest First Model for Session-Based Recommendation" by Haomei Duan and Jinghua Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "two real-world datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Results and Analysis)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Yoochoose**: This dataset is from the RecSys Challenge 2015 and is used for session-based recommendation tasks. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of clicks, sessions, and items.

2. **Diginetica**: This dataset is from the CIKM Cup 2016 and is also used for session-based recommendation. Similar to Yoochoose, the authors provide statistics regarding its structure and usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **Yoochoose**, the citation is:
  > "Yoochoose Dataset." RecSys Challenge 2015. Available at: [http://www.yoochoose.com](http://www.yoochoose.com).

- For **Diginetica**, the citation is:
  > "Diginetica Dataset." CIKM Cup 2016. Available at: [https://cikm2016.cs.uvic.ca/](https://cikm2016.cs.uvic.ca/).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further analysis or integration into other systems or research efforts.
