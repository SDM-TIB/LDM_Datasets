To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimization Landscape of Tucker Decomposition" by Abraham Frandsen and Rong Ge, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments or analyses.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is typically where datasets are described. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research. If the authors mention any datasets, I will take note of their descriptions, including the number of samples, types of data, and any relevant details about how the datasets were processed or analyzed.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

If the paper mentions any datasets without providing full citations, I will note that as well and suggest looking for the original sources based on the context provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that full citations are included. This will facilitate easy reference and further research by others interested in the datasets used in this study.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation.
