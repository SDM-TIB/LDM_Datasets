To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Distance Metric Learning with GRAPH-BERT" by Jiawei Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments have been conducted on several benchmark graph datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this case, I find that the **experiments section (Section 5)** provides a clear description of the datasets used. The paper explicitly lists three benchmark datasets:

1. **AIDS Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, and it is noted that it has been used in previous works. The authors mention that the ground truth for this dataset is based on graph edit distance (GED).

2. **LINUX Dataset**: Similar to the AIDS dataset, this dataset is also referenced as a benchmark used in the experiments, with the ground truth computed using graph edit distance.

3. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as having larger graph instances, and the authors describe how the ground truth is computed using a combination of distances from other methods (Beam, VJ, and Hungarian).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **AIDS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zeng, Z., Tung, A. K. H., Wang, J., Feng, J., and Zhou, L. "Comparing stars: On approximating graph edit distance." *Proc. VLDB Endow.*, 2(1):25–36, August 2009. doi: 10.14778/1687627.1687631.

- For the **LINUX Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, X., Ding, X., Tung, A., Ying, S., and Jin, H. "An efficient graph indexing method." *Proceedings - International Conference on Data Engineering*, 04 2012. doi: 10.1109/ICDE.2012.28.

- For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yanardag, P. and Vishwanathan, S. "Deep graph kernels." *In Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining*, KDD ’15, pp. 1365–1374, New York, NY, USA, 2015. Association for Computing Machinery. doi: 10.1145/2783258. 

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
