To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid and Non-Uniform Quantization Methods Using Retro Synthesis Data for Efficient Inference" by Tej Pratap GVSL and Raja Kumar, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a "faux dataset" referred to as **Retro-Synthesis Data**, which is generated from the FP32 model layer statistics. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to gather more details.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of quantization and mentions that the proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art methods on the **ImageNet** and **CIFAR-10** datasets. This suggests that these datasets are used for evaluation.

In the **methodology** section, I will look for specific details about the datasets used in the experiments. The authors describe the **Retro-Synthesis Data** generation process, but they also reference the **ImageNet** and **CIFAR-10** datasets as benchmarks for their quantization methods.

I will then check the **experiments** section to confirm the datasets used for evaluation. The results tables indicate that the proposed methods were tested on the **ImageNet** and **CIFAR-10** datasets, providing further validation of their use.

Finally, I will consult the **references** section to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 248â€“255, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
