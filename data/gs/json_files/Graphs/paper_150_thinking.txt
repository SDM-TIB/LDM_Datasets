To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-localization from Images with Small Overlap" by Tanaka Kanji, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets or experimental setups that involve data collection. The author mentions the use of a stereo SLAM system to collect view images, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Problem)**, specifically subsection A (Dataset), where the author describes the dataset collected around a university campus. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the type of images collected and the ground-truth viewpoint information.

The dataset is described as follows:
- **Dataset of View Images**: Collected using a stereo SLAM system with visual odometry, consisting of images sized 640 Ã— 480 pixels from the left eye view of the stereo camera.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the author refers to specific subsets of the collected dataset for different experiments.

After identifying the dataset, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is collected by the author, I will note that the citation will refer to the paper itself.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Tanaka Kanji. *Self-localization from Images with Small Overlap*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2016.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the dataset description and the full citation in a structured manner.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured.
