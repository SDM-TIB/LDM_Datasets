To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning a Transferable Scheduling Policy for Various Vehicle Routing Problems Based on Graph-Centric Representation Learning," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation or experimentation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will specifically look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, I will look for any references to specific datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using **random instances** for training their model, which are generated with varying numbers of vehicles, customers, and refueling stations. They also refer to benchmark problems obtained from libraries such as the **mTSP library**, **CVRP library**, and **TSP library**. 

To ensure I capture all relevant datasets, I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to these libraries or datasets. This is crucial for providing full citations for each dataset mentioned.

Here are the datasets identified:

1. **Random mCVRP Instances**: These are generated instances used for training the model, which involve varying numbers of vehicles, customers, and refueling stations. Since these are not published datasets, they do not have a formal citation.

2. **mTSP Library**: This library is referenced for benchmark problems related to the multi-agent traveling salesman problem. The citation for this library is:
   > Uchoa, E., Pecin, D., Pessoa, A., Poggi, M., Vidal, T., & Subramanian, A. (2017). New benchmark instances for the capacitated vehicle routing problem. *European Journal of Operational Research*, 257(3), 845-858.

3. **CVRP Library**: Similar to the mTSP library, this library is used for benchmark problems related to the capacitated vehicle routing problem. The citation is the same as above.

4. **TSP Library**: This library is used for benchmark problems related to the traveling salesman problem. The citation for this library is:
   > Reinhelt, G. (2014). TSPLIB: A library of sample instances for the TSP (and related problems) from various sources and of various types. URL: http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes noting the characteristics of the datasets and ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
