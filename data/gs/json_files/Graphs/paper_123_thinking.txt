To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph-Based Neural Network Models with Multiple Self-Supervised Auxiliary Tasks" by Franco Manessi and Alessandro Rozza, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of self-supervised learning and multi-task learning, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where datasets are likely to be detailed.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets and Experimental Setup)**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Citeseer Dataset**: This dataset is described as a citation network containing 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, 6 classes, and 3,703 features per node.

2. **Cora Dataset**: Another citation network, the Cora dataset consists of 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 7 classes, and 1,433 features per node.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: This dataset is also a citation network with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, 3 classes, and 500 features per node.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the datasets as follows:

- For **Citeseer Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **Cora Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **Pubmed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

It appears that the same reference is used for all three datasets, which is common in the context of citation networks.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
