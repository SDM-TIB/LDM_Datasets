To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wasserstein Contrastive Representation Distillation" by Liqun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they conduct experiments on benchmark datasets for model compression and cross-modal transfer. This indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on various tasks, and it is likely that they will specify the datasets used for each task.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **CIFAR-100**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 100 classes. It is commonly used for evaluating image classification algorithms.

2. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset containing over 1.2 million images for training and 50,000 for validation, used for image classification tasks.

3. **STL-10**: This dataset contains 10 classes with 5,000 labeled and 100,000 unlabeled images, often used for unsupervised learning tasks.

4. **OCT-GA**: An institutional dataset consisting of 44,520 optical coherence tomography images of the retina, used for identifying geographic atrophy.

5. **OCT Dataset**: This dataset includes 108,312 images from 4,686 patients for 4-way classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

- For **STL-10**, the citation is:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. AISTATS, 2011.

- For **OCT-GA**, the citation is:
  > Daniel S Kermany, Michael Goldbaum, Wenjia Cai, Carolina CS Valentim, Huiying Liang, Sally L Baxter, Alex McKeown, Ge Yang, Xiaokang Wu, Fangbing Yan, et al. *Identifying medical diagnoses and treatable diseases by image-based deep learning*. Cell, 2018.

- For the **OCT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Daniel S Kermany, Michael Goldbaum, Wenjia Cai, Carolina CS Valentim, Huiying Liang, Sally L Baxter, Alex McKeown, Ge Yang, Xiaokang Wu, Fangbing Yan, et al. *Identifying medical diagnoses and treatable diseases by image-based deep learning*. Cell, 2018.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
