To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SkillBot: Identifying Risky Content for Children in Alexa Skills" by Tu Le et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the identification of **28 risky child-directed apps** and a dataset of **31,966 non-overlapping app behaviors** collected from **3,434 Alexa apps**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to extract.

Next, I will look into the **methodology and results sections** to gather more details about these datasets. In the **Kid Skill Analysis section (Section 6)**, the authors describe their analysis of **3,434 Alexa kid skills** and the collection of **31,966 conversations**. This confirms the size of the dataset mentioned in the abstract.

I will also check the **confounding utterances analysis section (Section 8)**, where the authors mention identifying **4,487 confounding utterances** shared among various skills. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

1. **Dataset of risky child-directed apps**:
   - The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, but it is derived from their own research findings.

2. **Dataset of non-overlapping app behaviors**:
   - This dataset is also based on the authors' own research and does not have a separate citation.

3. **Dataset of confounding utterances**:
   - Similar to the previous datasets, this is a result of the authors' analysis and does not have an external citation.

Since the datasets are primarily based on the authors' own research and findings, I will note that they are original datasets created as part of the study.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its context and significance in the research.

In conclusion, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that I have accurately captured the details and citations as required.
