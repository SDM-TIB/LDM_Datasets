To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PRIN/SPRIN: On Extracting Point-wise Rotation Invariant Features" by Yang You et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their methods on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section, which is often where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments. In this paper, I will specifically check **section 6.2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors mention the **ShapeNet part dataset**. This dataset is described as containing 16,881 shapes from 16 categories, annotated with part labels.

I will also check **section 6.3.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors refer to the **ModelNet40** dataset, which consists of 12,308 shapes from 40 categories. Additionally, they mention **ScanObjectNN**, a real-world point cloud object dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **ShapeNet part dataset**:
   > Yi, L., Kim, V. G., Ceylan, D., Shen, I.-C., Huang, Q., Sheffer, A., & Guibas, L. (2016). *A scalable active framework for region annotation in 3D shape collections*. SIGGRAPH Asia.

2. **ModelNet40**:
   > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., & Xiao, J. (2015). *3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 1912–1920.

3. **ScanObjectNN**:
   > Uy, M. A., Pham, Q.-H., Hua, B.-S., Nguyen, T., & Yeung, S.-K. (2019). *Revisiting point cloud classification: A new benchmark dataset and classification model on real-world data*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 1588–1597.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details for future reference or processing.
