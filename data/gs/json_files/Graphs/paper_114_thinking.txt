To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating Typed Syntactic Dependencies for Targeted Sentiment Classification Using Graph Attention Neural Network" by Xuefeng Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on "standard benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors mention that they conducted experiments on four benchmark datasets: **Restaurant**, **Laptop**, **Twitter**, and **MAMS**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant to their research.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors provide statistics about the datasets, including the number of samples in each category (positive, negative, neutral) for each dataset. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations may not be explicitly listed for the datasets themselves, but I will look for any papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail.

1. **Restaurant Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Pontiki, M., Galanis, D., Pavlopoulos, J., Papageorgiou, H., Androutsopoulos, I., & Manandhar, S. (2014). SemEval-2014 task 4: Aspect based sentiment analysis. In *SemEval*.

2. **Laptop Dataset**: The citation is the same as the Restaurant dataset since they are part of the same SemEval task:
   > Pontiki, M., Galanis, D., Pavlopoulos, J., Papageorgiou, H., Androutsopoulos, I., & Manandhar, S. (2014). SemEval-2014 task 4: Aspect based sentiment analysis. In *SemEval*.

3. **Twitter Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Ma, D., Li, S., Zhang, X., & Wang, H. (2017). Interactive attention networks for aspect-level sentiment classification. In *IJCAI*.

4. **MAMS Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Jiang, Q., Chen, L., Xu, R., Ao, X., & Yang, M. (2019). A challenge dataset and effective models for aspect-based sentiment analysis. In *Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP)*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research.
