To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks" by Vijay Prakash Dwivedi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the release of a benchmark framework that includes a diverse collection of mathematical and real-world graphs, indicating that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **section titled "Datasets"** where the authors provide a summary of the datasets included in their benchmark. This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their names, characteristics, and the tasks they are used for.

In the **table summarizing the datasets**, I will identify the following datasets mentioned:

1. **ZINC**: A dataset containing 12,000 molecular graphs used for graph regression tasks.
2. **AQSOL**: A dataset based on AqSolDB with 9,982 molecular graphs for predicting aqueous solubility.
3. **OGBL-COLLAB**: A dataset for link prediction tasks based on a collaboration network of scientists.
4. **WikiCS**: A dataset for node classification based on Wikipedia's Computer Science articles.
5. **MNIST**: A dataset for graph classification derived from the MNIST image dataset.
6. **CIFAR10**: A dataset for graph classification derived from the CIFAR10 image dataset.
7. **PATTERN**: A dataset for graph pattern recognition tasks.
8. **CLUSTER**: A dataset for semi-supervised graph clustering tasks.
9. **TSP**: A dataset for edge classification tasks related to the Traveling Salesman Problem.
10. **CSL**: A dataset for graph classification and isomorphism testing.
11. **CYCLES**: A dataset for binary classification tasks to detect cycles in graphs.
12. **GraphTheoryProp**: A dataset for multi-task graph property prediction.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.
