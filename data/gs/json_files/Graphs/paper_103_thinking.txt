To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Answering Conversational Questions on Structured Data" by Thomas Müller et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a novel approach to answering sequential questions based on structured objects, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, particularly in the context of the Sequential Question Answering (SQA) task.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and experimental setup sections**. In section 4 (Experimental Setup), the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on the **SequentialQA (SQA) dataset**. This is a clear indication that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

I will then gather details about the SQA dataset from the text. The authors describe it as consisting of sequences of questions that can be answered from a given table, with a total of 6,066 answer sequences containing 17,553 questions. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SQA dataset. The authors reference the original work related to the SQA dataset, which is by Iyyer et al. (2017). I will extract the citation from the references:

- For the **SQA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mohit Iyyer, Wen-tau Yih, and Ming-Wei Chang. *Search-based neural structured learning for sequential question answering*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1821–1831, Vancouver, Canada, 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.

In summary, the key steps I followed include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial context.
2. Identifying the dataset in the experimental setup section.
3. Gathering details about the dataset's structure and purpose.
4. Retrieving the full citation from the references.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the necessary information about the dataset used in the research paper.
