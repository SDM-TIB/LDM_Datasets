To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Ranking for Representation Learning" by Ali Varamesh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed framework, S2R2, is trained on **STL10** and **MS-COCO** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the study.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention using **STL10** and **MS-COCO** for training and evaluation. The paper provides details about STL10, stating it includes 100k unlabeled images from 10 known and some unknown categories, along with labeled train and test splits. For MS-COCO, the authors note that they used the train split (COCO-Train) with about 118k images and the validation split (COCO-Val) with 5k images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **STL10**, the citation is:
   > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In Proceedings of the fourteenth international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics, pages 215–223, 2011.

2. For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

Having gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will now prepare to compile this information into the required format for further processing or review.
