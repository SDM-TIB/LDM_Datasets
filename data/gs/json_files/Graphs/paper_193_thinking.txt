To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse Symmetric Tensor Regression for Functional Connectivity Analysis" by Da Xu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on brain functional connectivity and its association with Alzheimer's disease, which suggests that there may be relevant datasets related to neuroimaging.

Next, I will pay close attention to the **introduction** where the authors discuss the Berkeley Aging Cohort Study (BACS) as a motivating example. This indicates that the BACS dataset is likely to be one of the primary datasets used in the study.

In the **methods section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets used for analysis. The authors mention that the study applies their method to the BACS dataset, which consists of 111 controls and 29 cases, with each subject having a PIB measure (which corresponds to AÎ² deposition), age, and gender. This confirms that the BACS dataset is indeed utilized in their analysis.

I will also check the **experiments or results sections** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if there are specific details about the BACS dataset that need to be included.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the BACS dataset from the references section. The citation for the BACS dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, but I can infer that it is a well-known dataset in the field of neuroimaging and Alzheimer's research. Therefore, I will provide a general citation format for the BACS dataset based on common practices in the literature.

The citation for the Berkeley Aging Cohort Study (BACS) can be formatted as follows:
> Berkeley Aging Cohort Study (BACS). *Data on brain functional connectivity and Alzheimer's disease*. Available at: [insert URL or DOI if available].

After gathering this information, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
