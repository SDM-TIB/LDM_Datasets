To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Pre-training with Adversarial Fine-tuning for Zero-shot Expert Linking" by Bo Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of AMiner as a basis for linking external experts, which suggests that AMiner is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the part where the authors summarize the datasets used. In **Table 1**, the authors provide statistics for three datasets:

1. **AMiner**: This dataset is described as the largest manually-labeled name disambiguation dataset collected from AMiner, containing 45,187 experts and 399,255 support information entries.

2. **News**: This dataset consists of news articles collected from various Chinese tech platforms, with 1,824 articles and an average of 8.79 candidate experts linked to each article.

3. **LinkedIn**: The authors mention that they adopted this dataset from a previous work by Zhang et al. (2015), which contains 1,665 LinkedIn profiles and 50,000 support information entries.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **AMiner**, the citation is:
  > Tang, J., Zhang, J., Yao, L., Li, J., Zhang, L., & Su, Z. (2008). Arnetminer: extraction and mining of academic social networks. In Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, 990–998.

- For **News**, the authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset, but they mention that it was collected from several Chinese tech platforms.

- For **LinkedIn**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Y., Zhang, F., Yao, P., & Tang, J. (2015). Cosnet: Connecting heterogeneous social networks with local and global consistency. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining, 1485–1494.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
