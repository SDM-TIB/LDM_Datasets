To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Anomalies Through Contrast in Heterogeneous Data" by Debanjan Datta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the challenges of detecting anomalies in illegal timber trade and hints at the use of large-scale trade data. However, it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section (Section 6)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention five datasets:

1. **KDDCup99**: The authors describe this dataset as a benchmark for anomaly detection tasks, specifically using the 'Normal' class as normal data and attack classes as anomalies.

2. **KDDCup99-N**: This dataset is derived from KDDCup99, where instances labeled 'Neptune' are treated as normal data, and 'Normal' instances are considered anomalies.

3. **UNSW-NB15**: The authors state that data labeled as 'Normal' is used as normal data, while rarer attack classes such as Backdoor, Analysis, Shellcode, and Worms are treated as anomalies.

4. **NSL-KDD**: This dataset combines the train and test partitions of the original dataset, with the 'Normal' class chosen as normal data and the rest as anomalies.

5. **GureKDD**: Similar to the previous datasets, the 'Normal' class label is selected as normal data, while the rest are considered anomalies.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
