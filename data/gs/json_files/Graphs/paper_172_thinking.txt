To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-Contrastive Federated Learning" by Qinbin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various image classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for image classification tasks.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class. It is also widely used in the field of computer vision.

3. **Tiny-Imagenet**: This dataset contains 100,000 images across 200 classes, with each image being 64x64 pixels. It is a smaller version of the ImageNet dataset and is used for image classification tasks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about how these datasets were used, confirming their relevance to the study.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **Tiny-Imagenet**, the citation is:
  > Tiny ImageNet Challenge. *https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
