To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Logical Forms from Graph Representations of Text and Entities" by Peter Shaw et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their approach across several tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. The introduction elaborates on semantic parsing and mentions various tasks, indicating that specific datasets may be used for these tasks.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention three datasets in **section 5.1 (Semantic Parsing Datasets)**:

1. **GEO Dataset**: This dataset consists of natural language questions about US geography along with corresponding logical forms. The authors reference the original work by Zelle and Mooney (1996) and specify that they use 600 training examples and 280 test examples.

2. **ATIS Dataset**: This dataset includes natural language queries about travel planning, with a reference to Dahl et al. (1994). The authors mention using 4473 training examples and 448 test examples, representing logical forms as lambda expressions.

3. **SPIDER Dataset**: This is a large-scale text-to-SQL dataset that contains 10,181 questions and 5,693 unique complex SQL queries across 200 database tables. The authors cite Yu et al. (2018c) and specify using the standard training set of 8,659 training examples and a development set of 1,034 examples.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **GEO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zelle, J. M., & Mooney, R. J. (1996). Learning to parse database queries using inductive logic programming. In Proceedings of the Thirteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), pages 1050–1055.

- For the **ATIS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dahl, D. A., Bates, M., Brown, M., Fisher, W., Hunicke-Smith, K., Pallett, D., Rudnicky, A., & Shriberg, E. (1994). Expanding the scope of the ATIS task: The ATIS-3 corpus. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Human Language Technology, pages 43–48. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **SPIDER Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yu, T., Zhang, R., Yasunaga, M., Li, Z., & Radev, D. (2018c). Spider: A large-scale human-labeled dataset for complex and cross-domain semantic parsing and text-to-SQL task. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.08887.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
