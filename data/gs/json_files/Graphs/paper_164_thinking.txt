To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Molecular Graph Neural Networks for Predicting Molecule Properties" by Zeren Shui and George Karypis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **QM9 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention that they evaluate their model on the **QM9 dataset**. They provide details about the dataset, including that it consists of around 130,000 equilibrium molecules associated with 12 properties.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the QM9 dataset. The relevant citation is:
> R. Ramakrishnan, P. O. Dral, M. Rupp, and O. A. Von Lilienfeld. *Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules*. Scientific Data, vol. 1, p. 140022, 2014.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the QM9 dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation as required. The QM9 dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, so I will focus solely on that for my final output.
