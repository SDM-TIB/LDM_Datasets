To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EDGNN: A Simple and Powerful GNN for Directed Labeled Graphs" by Guillaume Jaume et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors benchmark their algorithm on graph and node classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention two types of tasks: graph classification and node classification. 

In **subsection 3.1 (Datasets and Baselines)**, the authors list the datasets used for graph classification:

1. **MUTAG Dataset**: This dataset consists of 188 graphs, each representing chemical compounds, and is used for predicting mutagenicity.

2. **PTC (Predictive Toxicology Challenge) Datasets**: The authors mention several variants of the PTC dataset:
   - **PTC FM**: 349 graphs.
   - **PTC FR**: 351 graphs.
   - **PTC MM**: 336 graphs.
   - **PTC MR**: 344 graphs.

For node classification, the authors mention the **AIFB Dataset** and the **MUTAG Dataset** again, indicating that they are used in both contexts.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MUTAG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Debnath, A. K., Lopez de Compadre, R. L., Debnath, G., Shusterman, A. J., & Hansch, C. (1991). Structure-Activity Relationship of Mutagenic Aromatic and Heteroaromatic Nitro Compounds. Correlation with Molecular Orbital Energies and Hydrophobicity. *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry*, 34, 786–797.

- For the **PTC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Helma, C., King, R. D., Kramer, S., & Srinivasan, A. (2003). The Predictive Toxicology Challenge 2000-2001. *Bioinformatics*, 19(1), 1179–1182.

- For the **AIFB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ristoski, P., & Paulheim, H. (2016). RDF2Vec: RDF graph embeddings for data mining. In *Lecture Notes in Computer Science*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
