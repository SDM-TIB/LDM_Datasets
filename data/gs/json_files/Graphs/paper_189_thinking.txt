To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive and Generative Graph Convolutional Networks for Graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning" by Sheng Wan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experimental results section**, I will look for a table or a description that lists the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, I find a table (Table 1) that summarizes the statistics of the datasets used, which includes:

1. **Cora**: A citation network with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, and 7 classes.
2. **CiteSeer**: Another citation network with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, and 6 classes.
3. **PubMed**: A larger citation network with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, and 3 classes.
4. **Amazon Computers**: A product co-purchase network with 13,752 nodes, 245,861 edges, and 10 classes.
5. **Amazon Photo**: Another product co-purchase network with 7,650 nodes, 119,081 edges, and 8 classes.
6. **Coauthor CS**: A co-author network in computer science with 18,333 nodes, 81,894 edges, and 15 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the datasets as follows:

- **Cora**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
