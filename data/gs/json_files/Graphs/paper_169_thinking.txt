To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constant Curvature Graph Convolutional Networks" by Gregor Bachmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets employed in the study.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors might have used to validate their methods. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. I will look for subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Data Collection." Here, I will extract the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).

For this paper, I notice that the authors mention three synthetic datasets created for their experiments:

1. **Tree Dataset**: A balanced tree of depth 5 and branching factor 4 consisting of 1365 nodes and 1364 edges.
2. **Torus Dataset**: Points sampled from a planar torus, resulting in 1000 nodes and 30626 edges.
3. **Spherical Graph Dataset**: Points sampled from S2, connecting nodes if their distance is smaller than 0.2, leading to 1000 nodes and 17640 edges.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets that are not original to the authors. In this case, since the datasets are synthetic and created by the authors, I will not need to find external citations.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full names and descriptions of each dataset along with any relevant statistics. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

By following this methodical approach, I will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant dataset information from the paper, including proper citations where applicable.
