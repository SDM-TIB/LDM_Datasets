To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Risk Management via Anomaly Circumvent: Mnemonic Deep Learning for Midterm Stock Prediction" by Xinyi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the S&P 500 stocks for experiments, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Performance Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experiments in detail. They mention that the data for their project consists of historical S&P 500 component stocks downloaded from Yahoo Finance, covering a period of about 10 years (from 01/02/2009 to 12/24/2018). This indicates that the S&P 500 dataset is a primary dataset used in their analysis.

In this section, they also specify that the dataset contains 451 stocks, each recording the close price and trading volume over 2,800 trading days. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the S&P 500 dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from Yahoo Finance and not a standalone publication, I will note that the dataset is publicly available and can be cited as follows:

- **S&P 500 Dataset**: 
  > Yahoo Finance. Historical data for S&P 500 component stocks. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **S&P 500 Dataset**: This dataset includes historical stock prices and trading volumes for 451 stocks that are part of the S&P 500 index, covering a period from January 2, 2009, to December 24, 2018. The dataset consists of 2,800 trading days of data.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the citation for the dataset is included for proper attribution.
