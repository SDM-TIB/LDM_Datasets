To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dissecting the Diffusion Process in Linear Graph Convolutional Networks" by Yifei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics such as the number of nodes, edges, or other characteristics that define the datasets.

In this paper, the authors mention using three standard citation networks: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, and **Pubmed**. I will take note of these datasets and their characteristics as described in the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Cora Dataset**:
   > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**:
   > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**:
   > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017.

Although the same citation is used for all three datasets, it is important to note that they are distinct datasets used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
