To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inductive Graph Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Kriging" by Yuankai Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions empirical results on several real-world spatiotemporal datasets, indicating that datasets are indeed used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections** to find specific mentions of datasets. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly list five datasets used for evaluation:

1. **METR-LA**: A traffic speed dataset from 207 sensors in Los Angeles collected over four months (March 1, 2012, to June 30, 2012).
2. **NREL**: A dataset that registers solar power output by 137 photovoltaic power plants in Alabama state in 2006.
3. **USHCN**: A dataset containing monthly precipitation data from 1218 locations spanning from 1899 to 2019.
4. **SeData**: A traffic speed dataset collected from 323 loop detectors in the Seattle highway network.
5. **PeMS-Bay**: A traffic speed dataset similar to METR-LA, consisting of a time series from 325 sensors in the Bay Area from January 1, 2017, to May 13, 2017.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
