To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sentiment Analysis for Troll Detection on Weibo" by Zidong Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, which includes sentiment analysis and troll detection on the Sina Weibo platform, indicating that datasets related to these topics are likely discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their research. Here, they mention three distinct datasets:

1. **Chinese Segmentation Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the SIGHAN 2005 Competition for Chinese sentence processing, containing approximately 860,000 segmented Chinese sentences for training and about 22,000 unsegmented sentences for testing.

2. **Sentiment Analysis Dataset**: This dataset includes 16,548 sentences with positive sentiment and 18,574 with negative sentiment, sourced from Chinese online shopping, movie, and book reviews. Additionally, the authors crawled about 5 million Sina Weibo posts to create a collection of 2,325,644 sentences with positive sentiment and 960,899 sentences with negative sentiment.

3. **Troll Detection Dataset**: This dataset consists of user information and comments crawled from Weibo, including a small dataset of 673 normal users and 75 trolls sourced from Kaggle. The authors also describe the features extracted from this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
