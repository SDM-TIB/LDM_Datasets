To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hebbian Semi-Supervised Learning in a Sample Efficiency Setting" by Gabriele Lagani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were performed on various object recognition datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **CIFAR10**: This dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, belonging to 10 classes. The training images were split into a training set of 40,000 images and a validation set of 10,000 images.

2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10, this dataset also contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, but it belongs to 100 classes. The training images were also split into a training set of 40,000 images and a validation set of 10,000 images.

3. **Tiny ImageNet**: This dataset contains 100,000 training images and 10,000 test images, belonging to 200 classes. The training images were split into a training set of 90,000 images and a validation set of 10,000 images.

In the same section, the authors discuss the sample efficiency regimes they considered, which further confirms the datasets used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > J. Wu, Q. Zhang, G. Xu. *Tiny ImageNet Challenge*. Technical report, Stanford University, 2017.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

1. **CIFAR10**: A dataset with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 10 classes.
   - Citation: Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR100**: A dataset with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 100 classes.
   - Citation: Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

3. **Tiny ImageNet**: A dataset with 100,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 200 classes.
   - Citation: J. Wu, Q. Zhang, G. Xu. *Tiny ImageNet Challenge*. Technical report, Stanford University, 2017.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
