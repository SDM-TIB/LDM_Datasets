To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BayesGrad: Explaining Predictions of Graph Convolutional Networks" by Hirotaka Akita et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a real dataset to evaluate their method, which suggests that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In **section 4.1 (Quantitative Evaluation on Tox21 Synthetic Data)**, they mention the **Tox21 dataset**, which is a collection of chemical compounds. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of training, validation, and test samples, as well as the specific labels used in their experiments.

In **section 4.3 (Evaluation on Solubility Dataset)**, they refer to the **ESOL dataset**, which contains compounds with measured log solubility. The authors describe how they used this dataset to evaluate their approach and provide insights into the chemical properties related to solubility.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Tox21 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ruili Huang, Menghang Xia, Dac-Trung Nguyen, Tongan Zhao, Srilatha Sakamuru, Jinghua Zhao, Sampada A Shahane, Anna Rossoshek, and Anton Simeonov. *Tox21challenge to build predictive models of nuclear receptor and stress response pathways as mediated by exposure to environmental chemicals and drugs*. Frontiers in Environmental Science, 3:85, 2016.

- For the **ESOL dataset**, the citation is:
  > John S. Delaney. *Esol: Estimating aqueous solubility directly from molecular structure*. Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences, 44(3):1000â€“1005, 2004.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
