To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GRAPHCGAN: Convolutional Graph Neural Network with Generative Adversarial Networks," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In **Section 5.1 (Datasets)**, they list three standard citation network benchmark datasets: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, and **Pubmed**. Each of these datasets is commonly used in graph-based semi-supervised learning tasks.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the work by Sen et al. (2008) for these datasets, which is crucial for providing the complete citation.

The full citation for the datasets is:
> Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Galligher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3):93â€“93, 2008.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset used for node classification tasks.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset, similar to Cora, used for evaluating classification algorithms.
3. **Pubmed**: A dataset derived from PubMed articles, also used for node classification tasks.

With this information, I can now prepare to format the dataset entries according to the required structure, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This systematic approach ensures that I have not missed any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
