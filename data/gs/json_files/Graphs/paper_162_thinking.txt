To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the equivalence of molecular graph convolution and molecular wave function with poor basis set" by Masashi Tsubaki and Teruyasu Mizoguchi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the QM9 dataset, which is a significant dataset in the context of molecular properties. This indicates that I should look for more details about this dataset in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Evaluation)**, where the authors discuss their evaluation metrics and datasets used for training and testing their model. Here, they specifically mention the **QM9under14atoms** dataset, which is a subset of the QM9 dataset, and the **QM9over15atoms** dataset. The authors provide details about the number of molecules in each dataset and the properties being predicted.

In the **supplementary materials**, the authors elaborate on the QM9 dataset, stating that it contains approximately 130,000 molecules made up of H, C, N, O, and F atoms, along with 13 quantum chemical properties for each molecule. They also describe how they created the QM9under14atoms dataset, which consists of around 15,000 molecules with fewer than 14 atoms, and the QM9over15atoms dataset, which includes approximately 115,000 molecules with more than 15 atoms.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. **QM9 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Raghunathan Ramakrishnan, Pavlo O Dral, Matthias Rupp, and O Anatole Von Lilienfeld. *Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules*. Scientific Data, 1:140022, 2014.

2. **QM9under14atoms Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the QM9 dataset, so the citation remains the same as above.

3. **QM9over15atoms Dataset**: Similarly, this dataset is also derived from the QM9 dataset, thus it shares the same citation.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation, ready for further processing or review. This structured approach will help in accurately extracting and referencing datasets from the research paper.
