To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A System for Automated Open-Source Threat Intelligence Gathering and Management" by Peng Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract discusses the need for high-quality open-source Cyber Threat Intelligence (OSCTI) and mentions the construction of a security knowledge graph, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in this process.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** or **architecture** sections, particularly in the **OSCTI Reports Collection** and **Security Knowledge Ontology Design** subsections. These sections may provide insights into the types of data collected and the sources used for gathering OSCTI reports.

In the **OSCTI Reports Collection** section, the authors mention that they have collected over **120K+ OSCTI reports** from various sources, which indicates a significant dataset. However, I need to find specific names or references to datasets that are used in their experiments or system evaluations.

I will also check the **related work** and **conclusion** sections for any references to datasets that may have been used in previous studies or comparisons. This could provide additional context or citations for datasets relevant to their work.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to obtain full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced by others.

For example, if the paper mentions datasets like the **MITRE ATT&CK framework** or specific OSCTI sources, I will look for their full citations in the references. The citation format typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year, which I will need to document accurately.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future research or applications.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I thoroughly extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on accuracy and completeness in the citations.
