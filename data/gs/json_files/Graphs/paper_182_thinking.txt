To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gauge Equivariant Mesh CNNs" by Pim de Haan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments to validate their model, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 6)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Embedded MNIST**: This dataset consists of MNIST digit classification experiments conducted on embedded rectangular meshes of 28×28 vertices. The authors describe how they generated different geometries for the dataset.

2. **FAUST Dataset**: This dataset is used for non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. The authors specify that it consists of 100 meshes of human bodies in various positions, split into 80 train and 20 test meshes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **FAUST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bogo, F., Romero, J., Loper, M., & Black, M. J. (2014). *Faust: Dataset and evaluation for 3D mesh registration*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 3794–3801.

The Embedded MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset, so I will use the standard citation for it:
- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., & Burges, C. J. C. (1998). *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
