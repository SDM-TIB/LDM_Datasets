To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Card Shuffling Hypotheses: Building a Time and Memory Efficient Graph Convolutional Network," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several important tasks in 3D deep learning, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they specifically mention using the **ModelNet40 dataset** for point cloud classification, the **ShapeNetPart dataset** for part segmentation, and the **S3DIS dataset** for semantic segmentation. Each of these datasets is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **ModelNet40 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., & Xiao, J. (2015). 3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1912–1920.

2. **ShapeNetPart Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Chang, A. X., Funkhouser, T., Guibas, L., Hanrahan, P., Huang, Q., Li, Z., ... & Savarese, S. (2015). ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012.

3. **S3DIS Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Armeni, I., Sener, O., Zamir, A. R., Jiang, H., Brilakis, I., Fischer, M., & Savarese, S. (2016). 3D semantic parsing of large-scale indoor spaces. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1534–1543.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
