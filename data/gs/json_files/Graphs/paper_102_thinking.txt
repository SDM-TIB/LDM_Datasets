To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Graph Transformer for Free-Hand Sketch Recognition" by Peng Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors report experiments on **414k sketches from Google QuickDraw**, indicating that this is a significant dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors provide more details about the dataset. In the **Experimental Setting** subsection, they describe the **Google QuickDraw** dataset as the largest available sketch dataset containing **50 million sketches**. They explain how the sketches are represented as simplified stroke key points in temporal order, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

In the same section, the authors provide summary statistics for their subset of QuickDraw, which includes:
- **Training Set**: 345,000 samples
- **Validation Set**: 34,500 samples
- **Test Set**: 34,500 samples

This detailed breakdown confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Google QuickDraw dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Ha, D., & Eck, D. (2017). *A neural representation of sketch drawings*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.03477.

Since the authors refer to the dataset in their work, I will ensure to include this citation in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
