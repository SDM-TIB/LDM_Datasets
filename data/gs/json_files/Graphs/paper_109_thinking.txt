To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Path-Augmented Graph Transformer Network" by Benson Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their model is evaluated on several molecular property prediction datasets, specifically naming **QM7, QM8, QM9, ESOL, Lipophilicity, BACE, and BBBP**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They confirm that they tested their model on **7 benchmark property prediction tasks**: QM7, QM8, QM9 (quantum chemistry), ESOL, Lipophilicity (physical chemistry), and BACE, BBBP (biochemistry). This section will help me understand the context and characteristics of each dataset.

Now, I will gather the necessary details about each dataset mentioned:

1. **QM7**: A dataset used for quantum chemistry property prediction, containing 6,830 molecules.
2. **QM8**: Another quantum chemistry dataset with 21,786 molecules.
3. **QM9**: A larger quantum chemistry dataset consisting of 133,885 molecules.
4. **ESOL**: A dataset for physical chemistry property prediction with 1,128 molecules.
5. **Lipophilicity**: A dataset containing 4,200 molecules, also for physical chemistry.
6. **BACE**: A biochemistry dataset with 1,513 molecules.
7. **BBBP**: Another biochemistry dataset consisting of 2,039 molecules.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference a key paper for the datasets used:

- For **QM7, QM8, QM9, ESOL, Lipophilicity, BACE, and BBBP**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z., Ramsundar, B., Feinberg, E. N., Gomes, J., Geniesse, C., Pappu, A. S., Leswing, K., and Pande, V. *Moleculenet: a benchmark for molecular machine learning*. Chemical Science, 9(2):513â€“530, 2018.

This citation covers all the datasets mentioned, as they are part of the Moleculenet benchmark.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
