To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CayleyNets: Graph Convolutional Neural Networks with Complex Rational Spectral Filters" by Ron Levie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed model on various tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors often provide context for their work, including references to datasets used in previous studies or benchmarks. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks that the authors plan to evaluate their method against.

I will then focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), which typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." 

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the context of their experiments:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for handwritten digit classification tasks. The authors mention using it to evaluate their model's performance.

2. **CORA Dataset**: This dataset consists of scientific papers and is used for vertex classification tasks. The authors describe its structure and the classification task they performed.

3. **MovieLens Dataset**: This dataset is used for recommendation systems and is mentioned in the context of matrix completion tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **CORA Dataset**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93, 2008.

- For **MovieLens Dataset**:
  > Miller, B. N., et al. *MovieLens unplugged: experiences with an occasionally connected recommender system*. In Proceedings of the Intelligent User Interfaces, 2003.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that the full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or datasets mentioned in the paper.
