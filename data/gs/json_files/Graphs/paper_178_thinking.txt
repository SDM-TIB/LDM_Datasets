To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Incorporating Biological Knowledge with Factor Graph Neural Network for Interpretable Deep Learning" by Tianle Ma and Aidong Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. In the abstract, the authors mention applying their model to **two cancer genomic datasets** to predict target clinical variables. This indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they state that they downloaded the harmonized gene expression datasets for **Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (project ID: TCGA-LUSC)** and **Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (project ID: TCGA-KIRC)** from the Genomic Data Commons Data Portal. This section provides the necessary details about the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references or relevant sources. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (TCGA-LUSC)**, the citation is:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *Comprehensive genomic characterization of squamous cell lung cancers*. Nature, 489(7417):519-525, 2012. DOI: 10.1038/nature11404.

- For **Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (TCGA-KIRC)**, the citation is:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *Comprehensive molecular characterization of clear cell renal cell carcinoma*. Nature, 499(7456):43-49, 2013. DOI: 10.1038/nature12222.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly describes each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for any further analysis or reference.
