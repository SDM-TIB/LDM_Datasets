To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Similarity Graph Neural Network on Electronic Health Records" by Zheng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **MIMIC-III dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they conduct experiments on the **MIMIC-III dataset** for the diagnosis prediction task. This confirms that MIMIC-III is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **MIMIC-III Dataset**: 
  > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Li-wei, H., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., Moody, B., Szolovits, P., Celi, L. A., & Mark, R. G. (2016). MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data*, 3, 160035. doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.35

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: This dataset consists of health records of 46,520 intensive care unit (ICU) patients over 11 years. It includes various types of medical information, such as demographics, laboratory test results, diagnoses, medications, and procedures.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their citations from the research paper.
