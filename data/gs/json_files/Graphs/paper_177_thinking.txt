To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Self-Supervised Gait Encoding Approach with Locality-Awareness for 3D Skeleton Based Person Re-Identification" by Haocong Rao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly section 4, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention four datasets used for their experiments:

1. **BIWI Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method and contains 50 unique subjects with dynamic skeleton data.

2. **IAS-Lab Dataset**: This dataset includes 11 unique subjects and is utilized for testing the proposed approach.

3. **Kinect Gait Biometry Dataset (KGBD)**: This dataset consists of 164 unique subjects and is also employed in the experiments.

4. **CASIA B Dataset**: A large-scale RGB video-based dataset that includes 124 individuals and is used for evaluating the method on skeleton data estimated from RGB videos.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **BIWI Dataset**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in any subsequent work.
