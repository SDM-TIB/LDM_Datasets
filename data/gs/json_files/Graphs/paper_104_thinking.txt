To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLUTRR: A Diagnostic Benchmark for Inductive Reasoning from Text" by Koustuv Sinha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract introduces the CLUTRR benchmark, which suggests that it is a dataset itself, but I need to confirm this and look for additional datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for benchmarks that test systematic generalization and robustness in natural language understanding (NLU) systems. They mention existing datasets for reading comprehension and reasoning, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **benchmark design and data generation sections**. Here, the authors describe the CLUTRR benchmark in detail, including how it generates semi-synthetic stories based on kinship relations. This indicates that CLUTRR is a dataset designed for evaluating NLU systems, and I will need to gather specific details about it.

The paper states that the CLUTRR benchmark allows researchers to generate diverse semi-synthetic short stories to test different aspects of inductive reasoning capabilities. I will note that CLUTRR is the primary dataset discussed.

Now, I will check the **experiments section** to see if any other datasets are mentioned in relation to the experiments conducted. The authors compare various NLU models on the CLUTRR benchmark, but they also reference other datasets used for comparison, such as SQuAD, NewsQA, and others. I will extract the relevant details about these datasets.

In the **references section**, I will look for full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the CLUTRR benchmark, the citation is:
> Koustuv Sinha, Shagun Sodhani, Jin Dong, Joelle Pineau, and William L. Hamilton. *CLUTRR: A Diagnostic Benchmark for Inductive Reasoning from Text*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2020.

For the other datasets mentioned, I will extract their citations as well:
- **SQuAD**:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 2383–2392, 2016.

- **NewsQA**:
  > Adam Trischler, Tong Wang, Xingdi Yuan, Justin Harris, Alessandro Sordoni, Philip Bachman, and Kaheer Suleman. *NewsQA: A Machine Comprehension Dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 193–203, 2016.

- **MCTest**:
  > Matthew Richardson, Christopher JC Burges, and Erin Renshaw. *MCTest: A Challenge Dataset for the Open-Domain Machine Comprehension of Text*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 193–203, 2013.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
