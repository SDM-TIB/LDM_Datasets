To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Intention Network for Click-through Rate Prediction in Sponsored Search" by Feng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract discusses the Graph Intention Network (GIN) and its application in click-through rate (CTR) prediction, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the challenges in CTR prediction but again does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 3) to see if any datasets are mentioned. In the **3.1 Experimental Setup** subsection, the authors describe the graph data constructed from users' click behavior data over 30 days, which includes 1 billion nodes and 8 billion edges. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation here.

I will also check the **References section** to identify any datasets that may have been referenced indirectly. The authors mention using "usersâ€™ click behavior data" but do not provide a specific dataset name or citation. It appears that the dataset used is proprietary or specific to their organization (Alibaba Group) and may not have a formal citation.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will summarize the information I have gathered:

1. **User Click Behavior Data**: This dataset is constructed from user click behavior over a 30-day period, containing 1 billion nodes and 8 billion edges. However, there is no formal citation provided for this dataset, as it appears to be internal data from Alibaba.

Given that there are no formal datasets with citations provided in the paper, I will note that the primary dataset referenced is the internal user click behavior data, but I cannot provide a full citation for it.

In conclusion, I will compile the information I have gathered, noting the lack of formal dataset citations, and prepare to present this information in a structured format for review or further processing.
