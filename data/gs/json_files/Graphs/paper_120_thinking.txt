To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Bayesian Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Forecasting" by Jun Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they verify their method on **two real-world datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two datasets:

1. **SZ-taxi Dataset**: This dataset records the traffic speed of 156 major roads in Luohu District, Shenzhen, from January 1 to January 31, 2015. The data is aggregated every 15 minutes.

2. **Los-loop Dataset**: This dataset collects the traffic speed of 207 highways in Los Angeles County from March 1 to March 7, 2012. The data is aggregated every 5 minutes.

Both datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper, and their descriptions provide insights into the data's temporal resolution and geographical context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are not typically published in the same way as academic papers, they may not have formal citations. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper:

- For the **SZ-taxi Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided, but it is described as a dataset collected from the Luohu District in Shenzhen.

- For the **Los-loop Dataset**, similarly, the citation is not explicitly provided, but it is described as a dataset collected from Los Angeles County.

Since these datasets are not associated with formal publications, I will summarize their details as follows:

1. **SZ-taxi Dataset**: Traffic speed data from 156 major roads in Luohu District, Shenzhen, collected from January 1 to January 31, 2015, aggregated every 15 minutes.

2. **Los-loop Dataset**: Traffic speed data from 207 highways in Los Angeles County, collected from March 1 to March 7, 2012, aggregated every 5 minutes.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
