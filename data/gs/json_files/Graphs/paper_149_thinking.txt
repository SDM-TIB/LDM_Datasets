To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Diffusion-Embedding Networks" by Bo Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on several benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used. In Table 2, they list three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, and 1,433 features. It has 7 classes and a label rate of 0.052.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, and 3,703 features. It has 6 classes and a label rate of 0.036.
3. **Pubmed**: This dataset consists of 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, and 500 features. It has 3 classes and a label rate of 0.003.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used benchmark datasets in the field of machine learning and graph-based learning, they may not have specific papers associated with them in the references. Instead, I will note their general usage in the community.

Now, I will compile the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the relevant details such as the number of nodes, edges, features, classes, and label rates. I will also ensure to provide a proper citation for the datasets based on their common references in the literature.

For the **Cora dataset**, the citation is:
> Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

For the **Citeseer dataset**, the citation is:
> Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

For the **Pubmed dataset**, the citation is:
> Namata, G., Sen, P., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their respective details and citations, ready for structured output.
