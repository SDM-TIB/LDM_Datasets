To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aligning Cross-Lingual Entities with Multi-Aspect Information" by Hsiu-Wei Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method is evaluated on "two benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In section 4.1, they explicitly mention two datasets: **DBP15K** and **DBP100K**. I will take note of the statistics provided for each dataset, including the number of entities, relations, attributes, and inter-lingual links (ILLs) for different language pairs.

For **DBP15K**, the authors provide the following details:
- Contains 15,000 ILLs.
- Divided into three subsets: Chinese-English (ZH-EN), Japanese-English (JA-EN), and French-English (FR-EN).

For **DBP100K**, the details are:
- Contains 100,000 ILLs.
- Also divided into the same three subsets: ZH-EN, JA-EN, and FR-EN.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the original works that introduced these datasets, which are crucial for proper citation.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:
- For **DBP15K**, the citation is:
  > Sun, Z., Hu, W., & Li, C. (2017). Cross-lingual entity alignment via joint attribute-preserving embedding. In Proceedings of the International Semantic Web Conference.

- For **DBP100K**, the citation is the same as for DBP15K, as it is a larger version of the same dataset:
  > Sun, Z., Hu, W., & Li, C. (2017). Cross-lingual entity alignment via joint attribute-preserving embedding. In Proceedings of the International Semantic Web Conference.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
