To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SeCo: Exploring Sequence Supervision for Unsupervised Representation Learning" by Ting Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on several benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section** of the paper, which is explicitly dedicated to detailing the datasets used in their experiments. Here, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **Kinetics400 Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing around 300K videos from 400 action categories, with specific details about the training, validation, and testing splits.

2. **UCF101 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 13,320 videos from 101 action classes, with a breakdown of training and testing videos.

3. **HMDB51 Dataset**: This dataset includes 7K videos from 51 action categories, also split into training and testing sets.

4. **ActivityNet Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 19,994 videos from 200 activity categories, with details on the training, validation, and testing splits.

5. **GOT-10K Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing more than 10K real-world videos with moving objects and over 1.5M manually labeled bounding boxes.

6. **OTB-100 Dataset**: This dataset includes 100 video sequences used for evaluating object tracking.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Kinetics400 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kay, W., Carreira, J., Simonyan, K., et al. (2017). *The Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset*. arXiv:1705.06950.

- For **UCF101 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A Dataset of 101 Human Actions Classes From Videos in The Wild*. arXiv:1212.0402.

- For **HMDB51 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Garrote, E., Poggio, T., & Serre, T. (2011). *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In ICCV.

- For **ActivityNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Heilbron, F. C., Escorcia, V., Ghanem, B., & Niebles, J. C. (2015). *ActivityNet: A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding*. In CVPR.

- For **GOT-10K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Huang, L., Zhao, X., & Huang, K. (2019). *GOT-10k: A Large High-Diversity Benchmark for Generic Object Tracking in the Wild*. IEEE Trans. on PAMI.

- For **OTB-100 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Y., Lim, J., & Yang, M.-H. (2015). *Object Tracking Benchmark*. IEEE Trans. on PAMI.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
