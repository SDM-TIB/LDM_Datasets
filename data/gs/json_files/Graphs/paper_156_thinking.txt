To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Contrastive Learning of Audio-Visual Video Representations" by Shuang Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks including **UCF101, HMDB51, and ESC50**, which suggests that these datasets are likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their model on **UCF101**, **HMDB51**, and **ESC50**. This confirms that these datasets are indeed used for their experiments.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of each dataset:

1. **UCF101**: This dataset contains 13,320 video clips from 101 action categories. It is widely used for action recognition tasks.

2. **HMDB51**: This dataset consists of 7,000 video clips from 51 action categories. It is another popular benchmark for action recognition.

3. **ESC50**: This dataset includes 2,000 audio clips from 50 environmental sound classes. It is commonly used for sound classification tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:
  > Hildegard Kuehne, Hueihan Jhuang, Estíbaliz Garrote, Tomaso Poggio, and Thomas Serre. *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2556–2563, 2011.

- For **ESC50**, the citation is:
  > Karol J. Piczak. *ESC: Dataset for environmental sound classification*. In Proceedings of the 23rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pages 101–104, 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research.
