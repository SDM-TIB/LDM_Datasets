To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks on Link Prediction" by Xing Wang and Alexander Vinel, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper benchmarks several GNN models on different datasets for link prediction, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, as this section is likely to contain the specific datasets used in the experiments. Here, the author lists four datasets:

1. **Cora**: A citation network with 2,708 nodes and 5,429 edges, classified into seven classes. Each node is described by a bag-of-words vector.
   
2. **CiteSeer**: Another citation network containing 3,327 nodes and 4,732 edges, classified into six classes, with nodes described similarly to Cora.

3. **PubMed**: A citation network focused on diabetes research, containing 19,717 nodes and 44,338 edges, classified into three classes. Nodes are described by TF/IDF weighted vectors.

4. **WikiCS**: A dataset based on Wikipedia article references, consisting of 11,701 nodes and 216,213 edges, classified into ten classes. Each node is described by a 300-dimensional vector from GloVe embeddings.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper cites the datasets as follows:

- For **Cora** and **CiteSeer**, the citation is:
  > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.02907, 2016.

- For **PubMed**, the citation is:
  > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Variational graph auto-encoders*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.07308, 2016.

- For **WikiCS**, the citation is:
  > Péter Mernyei and C˘at˘alina Cangea. *Wiki-cs: A wikipedia-based benchmark for graph neural networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.02901, 2020.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about each dataset and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations as required.
