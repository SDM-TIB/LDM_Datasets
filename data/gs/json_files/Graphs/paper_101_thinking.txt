To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cognitive Graph for Multi-Hop Reading Comprehension at Scale" by Ming Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **HotpotQA fullwiki dataset** for evaluating their method, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this case, the **experiments section** (section 4.1) explicitly states that the authors used the **HotpotQA dataset** for their experiments. They describe it as containing 112,779 questions, with a significant portion requiring multi-hop reasoning. This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the HotpotQA dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Zhilin Yang, Peng Qi, Saizheng Zhang, Yoshua Bengio, William Cohen, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and Christopher D. Manning. *HotpotQA: A Dataset for Diverse, Explainable Multi-Hop Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2369â€“2380.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the HotpotQA dataset, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly, including its name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's key attributes, ensuring that the citation is included for reference. This will allow for easy access and verification of the dataset used in the research.
