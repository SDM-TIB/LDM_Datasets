To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks: Make the Community Detection Much Better" by Yaping Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on two real-world datasets, specifically **DBLP** and **IMDB**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research and should be examined further.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following information:

1. **DBLP Dataset**: The paper states that DBLP is a citation network dataset with specific characteristics:
   - **Nodes**: 20,919
   - **Edges**: 117,074
   - **Features**: 174
   - **Communities**: 3 (Information Retrieval, Data Base, Machine Learning)

2. **IMDB Dataset**: The IMDB dataset is described as follows:
   - **Nodes**: 10,114
   - **Edges**: 55,924
   - **Features**: 1,213
   - **Communities**: 5 (Action, Adventure, Comedy, Crime, Drama)

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly, but I can infer the following based on common knowledge:

- For the **DBLP dataset**, a typical citation might be:
  > DBLP. *DBLP Computer Science Bibliography*. Available at: https://dblp.uni-trier.de/

- For the **IMDB dataset**, a common citation would be:
  > IMDB. *Internet Movie Database*. Available at: https://www.imdb.com/

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will include the dataset names, their descriptions, and the corresponding citations.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately extracted the datasets, their characteristics, and provided proper citations, which are essential for any further analysis or replication of the research findings.
