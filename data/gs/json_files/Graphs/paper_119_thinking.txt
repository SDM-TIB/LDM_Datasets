To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Active Surface Models" by Udaranga Wickramasinghe, Pascal Fua, and Graham Knott, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors will demonstrate their method on the **ShapeNet** dataset and the **CortexEM** dataset, indicating that these are key datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly the **Experiments** section. In **section 4.1**, the authors describe the **ShapeNet** dataset, noting that it is a collection of 3D textured CAD models split into semantic categories. They mention using **ShapeNetCore.v1** and provide details about the number of models and images used for training and testing.

In **section 4.2**, the authors discuss the **CortexEM** dataset, which consists of a 500×500×200 FIB-SEM image stack of a mouse cortex. They specify how they extracted sub-volumes for training and testing, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **ShapeNet**, the citation is:
   > A. Chang, T. Funkhouser, L. G., P. Hanrahan, Q. Huang, Z. Li, S. Savarese, M. Savva, S. Song, H. Su, J. Xiao, L. Yi, and F. Yu. *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. In arXiv Preprint, 2015.

2. For **CortexEM**, the citation is:
   > Jorstad, A., Nigro, B., Cali, C., Wawrzyniak, M., Fua, P., and Knott, G.W. *Neuromorph: A Toolset for the Morphometric Analysis and Visualization of 3D Models Derived from Electron Microscopy Image Stacks*. Neuroinformatics, 13(1):83–92, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
