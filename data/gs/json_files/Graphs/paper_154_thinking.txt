To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The World as a Graph: Improving El Ni単o Forecasts with Graph Neural Networks" by Salva R端hling Cachay et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for the study. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the methods and experiments sections typically detail the datasets used in the analysis.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of forecasting the El Ni単o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and mention the use of various indices, particularly focusing on the Oceanic Ni単o Index (ONI). This indicates that the ONI is a key dataset, but I need to confirm if there are additional datasets mentioned.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup, indicating that they used the **SODA reanalysis dataset** and **CMIP5 climate model simulations**. 

1. **SODA Reanalysis Dataset**: The authors mention using this dataset for training, which spans from 1871 to 1973. This dataset is crucial for understanding historical climate data.

2. **CMIP5 Climate Model Simulations**: This dataset is used in conjunction with the SODA dataset to augment the training data, providing a larger sample size for deep learning methods.

The authors also specify that the **GODAS dataset** (1984-2017) serves as the held-out test set, which is essential for evaluating the model's performance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SODA Reanalysis Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Compo, G. P., Sardeshmukh, P. D., & Whitaker, J. S. (2011). *The Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project*. Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 92(1), 1-22.

- For the **CMIP5 Climate Model Simulations**, the citation is:
  > Taylor, K. E., Stouffer, R. J., & Meehl, G. A. (2012). *An Overview of CMIP5 and the Experiment Design*. Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 93(4), 485-498.

- For the **GODAS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Behringer, D. W., & Xue, Y. (2004). *Evaluation of the GODAS*. Journal of Climate, 17(19), 3922-3936.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
