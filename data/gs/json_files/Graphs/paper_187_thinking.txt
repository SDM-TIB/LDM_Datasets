To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Block Hankel Tensor ARIMA for Multiple Short Time Series Forecasting" by Qiquan Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors state that they conducted experiments on **three public datasets and two industrial datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will move to the **Introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of time series forecasting and mention the datasets used for their experiments. However, I need to find specific details about these datasets.

In the **Experiments** section, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. I will carefully read through this section to extract the names and descriptions of each dataset. The paper mentions:

1. **Traffic Dataset**: Collected from the California Department of Transportation, this dataset describes the road occupancy rate of the Los Angeles County highway network. The authors used a subset with 228 sensors aggregated to a daily interval for 80 days of data points.

2. **Electricity Dataset**: This dataset consists of hourly electricity consumption records from 321 clients. The authors merged every 24 time points to create a daily interval dataset with a size of 321 × 1096.

3. **Smoke Video Dataset**: This dataset records smoke from a factory chimney in Hokkaido, taken in 2007. The authors sampled and resized the images to obtain a third-order time series dataset of size 36 × 64 × 100.

4. **PC Sales Dataset**: An industrial dataset containing 105 weekly sales records of 9 personal computers from 2017 to 2019.

5. **Raw Materials Dataset**: Another industrial dataset that includes 2246 material items used in product manufacturing, with each item having 24 monthly demand quantities.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from various sources, I will need to ensure that I provide accurate citations for each dataset based on the information available in the paper and any external sources if necessary.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will involve structuring the information clearly and accurately to reflect the details provided in the paper.
