To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MANELA: A Multi-Agent Algorithm for Learning Network Embeddings" by Han Zhang and Hong Xu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used. The experimental sections typically detail the datasets employed in the evaluations.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the importance of network embeddings and refer to various datasets used in their experiments. This indicates that I should look for specific dataset names and descriptions.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection labeled **"Datasets"**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets they used for their experiments. I will extract the names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics about each dataset.

The paper mentions three datasets used in the experiments:

1. **BlogCatalog**: A network depicting bloggers' relationships, consisting of 10,312 nodes, 333,983 undirected edges, and 39 labels representing topic categories.

2. **Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI)**: A network illustrating the interactions of proteins, containing 3,890 nodes, 38,292 undirected edges, and 50 different labels derived from hallmark gene sets.

3. **Wikipedia**: A co-occurrence network of words found in Wikipedia, comprising 4,777 nodes, 92,091 undirected edges, and 40 different labels.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **BlogCatalog**:

- For **Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI)**:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
