To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Label-Aware Graph Convolutional Networks" by Hao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions conducting extensive node classification experiments on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention four benchmark datasets: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, **Pubmed**, and **Reddit**. I will note down the characteristics of each dataset as described in the paper.

For each dataset, I will gather the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including the number of nodes and any relevant features or characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution.

Now, I will look for the full citations for the datasets:
- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.02907, 2016.

- For **Citeseer**, the citation is:
  > Sen Zhang, et al. *Graph Attention Networks*. ICLR, 2019.

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is:
  > Will Hamilton, Zhitao Ying, and Jure Leskovec. *Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs*. In NIPS, 2017.

- For **Reddit**, the citation is:
  > Felix Wu, et al. *Simplifying Graph Convolutional Networks*. ICML, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
