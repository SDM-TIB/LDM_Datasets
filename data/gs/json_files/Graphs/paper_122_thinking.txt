To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Modelling Drug-Target Binding Affinity Using a BERT Based Graph Neural Network," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on "two drug-target interaction datasets that were previously used as benchmarks in recent work." This indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that might describe the datasets used. In this case, the **Materials and Methods** section provides detailed information about the datasets.

In **section 3.2 (Tasks)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Davis Kinase Dataset**: This dataset includes interactions between a subset of selectivity assays from a kinase protein family and a set of inhibitors, measured using the dissociation constant (Kd). It consists of 442 unique proteins and 68 unique drugs, with a total of 30,056 interactions.

2. **KIBA Dataset**: This dataset covers the bioactivity of specific kinase inhibitors from various studies, combining interactions based on Ki, Kd, and IC50 values. It contains 229 unique proteins and 2,111 unique drugs, with a total of 118,254 interactions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Davis Kinase Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mindy I Davis, Jeremy P Hunt, Sanna Herrgard, Pietro Ciceri, Lisa M Wodicka, Gabriel Pallares, Michael Hocker, Daniel K Treiber, and Patrick P Zarrinkar. *Comprehensive analysis of kinase inhibitor selectivity*. Nature biotechnology, 29(11):1046–1051, 2011.

- For the **KIBA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jing Tang, Agnieszka Szwajda, Sushil Shakyawar, Tao Xu, Petteri Hintsanen, Krister Wennerberg, and Tero Aittokallio. *Making sense of large-scale kinase inhibitor bioactivity data sets: a comparative and integrative analysis*. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 54(3):735–743, 2014.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations accurately. I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described, including its purpose, the number of proteins and drugs, and the total interactions, along with the full citation for each dataset.
