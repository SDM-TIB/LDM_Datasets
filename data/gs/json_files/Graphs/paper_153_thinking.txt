To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hypergraph Convolution and Hypergraph Attention" by Song Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experimental results with semi-supervised node classification, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **Section 4.1**, they mention using three citation network datasets: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, and **Pubmed**. Each dataset is described in terms of its characteristics, such as the number of nodes, edges, features, and classes.

1. **Cora Dataset**: This dataset contains 2,708 scientific publications divided into 7 categories, with 5,429 edges representing citation links. Each publication is described by a binary bag-of-words representation consisting of 1,433 unique words.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: Similar to Cora, this dataset includes 3,327 scientific publications divided into 6 categories, linked by 4,732 edges. Each publication is described by a binary bag-of-words representation with 3,703 dimensions.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: This dataset comprises 19,717 scientific publications divided into 3 classes, with 44,338 links. Each publication is represented using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) from a dictionary of 500 terms.

Additionally, the authors mention a modified version of the **20-newsgroup dataset** used for text categorization, which consists of 16,242 articles divided into 4 groups, with each article represented by binary occurrence values for 100 words.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Cora dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

- For the **Citeseer dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

- For the **Pubmed dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.

- For the **20-newsgroup dataset**, the citation is:
  > Roweis, S. (n.d.). 20 Newsgroups dataset. Retrieved from https://cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/data.html

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
