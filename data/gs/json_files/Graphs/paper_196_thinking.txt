To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Temporal Learning," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly name datasets, it sets the context for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on four action recognition datasets: **Kinetics-400**, **UCF101**, and **HMDB51**. I will extract details about each dataset, including their characteristics and how they were used in the study.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **Kinetics-400**: This is described as a large-scale action dataset containing approximately 300,000 videos across 400 classes. The authors used the training split (around 240,000 video samples) without any annotations for pre-training.

2. **UCF101**: This dataset consists of 13,000 videos spanning 101 human action classes. The authors used split 1 for pre-training and evaluation.

3. **HMDB51**: This dataset is smaller, containing about 7,000 videos across 51 classes. The authors also used split 1 for downstream task evaluation.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Kinetics-400**, the citation is:
  > Joao Carreira and Andrew Zisserman. *Quo vadis, action recognition? A new model and the kinetics dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 6299–6308, 2017.

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:
  > Hildegard Kuehne, Hueihan Jhuang, Estíbaliz Garrote, Tomaso Poggio, and Thomas Serre. *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In 2011 International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 2556–2563. IEEE, 2011.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
