To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language-Mediated, Object-Centric Representation Learning" by Ruocheng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets, which indicates that I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically the part where the authors describe their evaluation methods. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **ShopVRB**: This dataset is described as containing images of daily objects along with question-answer pairs. The authors reference a previous work by Nazarczuk and Mikolajczyk (2020) for this dataset.

2. **PartNet**: This dataset is noted to contain images of furniture with a hierarchical structure, and the authors mention that they supplemented it with descriptive sentences they collected themselves. The citation for this dataset is attributed to Mo et al. (2019).

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ShopVRB**, the citation is:
  > M. Nazarczuk and K. Mikolajczyk. *Shop-VRB: A Visual Reasoning Benchmark for Object Perception*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2020.

- For **PartNet**, the citation is:
  > K. Mo, S. Zhu, A. X. Chang, L. Yi, S. Tripathi, L. J. Guibas, and H. Su. *PartNet: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Fine-Grained and Hierarchical Part-Level 3D Object Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

Now that I have the names and full citations for both datasets, I will summarize the findings:

1. **ShopVRB**: A dataset of daily objects and question-answer pairs.
   - Citation: M. Nazarczuk and K. Mikolajczyk. *Shop-VRB: A Visual Reasoning Benchmark for Object Perception*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2020.

2. **PartNet**: A dataset containing images of furniture with hierarchical structure, supplemented by descriptive sentences.
   - Citation: K. Mo, S. Zhu, A. X. Chang, L. Yi, S. Tripathi, L. J. Guibas, and H. Su. *PartNet: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Fine-Grained and Hierarchical Part-Level 3D Object Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

With this information, I am now ready to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
