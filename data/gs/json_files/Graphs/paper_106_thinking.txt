To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discourse-Aware Neural Extractive Text Summarization" by Jiacheng Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the model and its performance on summarization benchmarks, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for specific names and details about the datasets.

Upon reviewing section 4.1, I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **CNN and Daily Mail (CNNDM)**: This dataset is used for training and evaluating the summarization model. The authors note that it contains 287,226 training samples, 13,368 validation samples, and 11,490 test samples.

2. **New York Times (NYT)**: This dataset is also utilized for evaluation, with 137,778 training samples, 17,222 validation samples, and 17,223 test samples.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For the **CNN and Daily Mail dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching Machines to Read and Comprehend*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28, pages 1693–1701, 2015.

- For the **New York Times dataset**, the citation is:
  > Evan Sandhaus. *The New York Times Annotated Corpus*. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, 2008.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **CNN and Daily Mail (CNNDM)**
   - Citation: Karl Moritz Hermann et al. *Teaching Machines to Read and Comprehend*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28, pages 1693–1701, 2015.

2. **New York Times (NYT)**
   - Citation: Evan Sandhaus. *The New York Times Annotated Corpus*. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, 2008.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their full citations from the research paper.
