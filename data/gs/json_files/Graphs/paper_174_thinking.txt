To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Age-Gap Face Verification by Feature Injection in Deep Networks" by Simone Bianco, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the section specifically dedicated to datasets**. The abstract mentions a new dataset called the **Large Age-Gap (LAG) dataset**, which is a strong indicator that I need to gather details about it.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Large Age-Gap Dataset)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive description of the LAG dataset. Here, I will note the key details:
- The dataset consists of **3,828 images** of **1,010 celebrities** collected from various sources, specifically targeting images that span large age gaps.
- The authors describe the methodology used for collecting the images, including the use of Google Image Search and manual curation to ensure quality.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In the **related works section**, the authors reference several existing datasets relevant to face recognition and age estimation, including:
1. **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)**: A dataset with 13,233 images of 5,749 people.
2. **FGNet**: Contains 1,002 images of 82 people with age ranges from 0 to 69.
3. **MORPH**: Comprises 55,134 images of 13,618 people with age ranges from 16 to 77.
4. **CACD**: A dataset with 163,446 images of 2,000 celebrities.
5. **CAFE**: A dataset with 4,659 images of 901 people, specifically for studying face verification with large age gaps.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Here are the citations I will extract:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
