To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GCNv2: Efficient Correspondence Prediction for Real-Time SLAM" by Jiexiong Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for training and evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they trained their network using the **TUM dataset** and a subset of the **SUN-3D dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section V (Experimental Results)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. They specifically mention:

1. **TUM Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the original GCN and is noted for providing accurate camera poses through a motion capturing system. 

2. **SUN-3D Dataset**: The authors created a subset of this dataset for training GCNv2. They describe it as containing millions of real-world recorded RGB-D images in various indoor environments, with a total of 44,624 frames extracted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **TUM dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sturm, J., Engelhard, J., Endres, F., Burgard, W., & Cremers, D. (2012). *A benchmark for the evaluation of RGB-D SLAM systems*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pp. 1-6.

- For the **SUN-3D dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, J., Owens, A., & Torralba, A. (2013). *SUN3D: A database of big spaces reconstructed using SFM and object labels*. In IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 1-8.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
