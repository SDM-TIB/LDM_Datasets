To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RECON: Relation Extraction using Knowledge Graph Context in a Graph Neural Network" by Anson Bastos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their method on two standard relation extraction datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Wikidata Dataset**: This dataset was created by linking the Wikipedia English Corpus to Wikidata and includes sentences with multiple relations. It has 353 unique relations and a total of 372,059 sentences for training and 360,334 for testing.

2. **NYT Freebase Dataset**: This dataset is annotated by linking New York Times articles with the Freebase knowledge graph. It contains 53 relations (including the "no relation" label "NA") and has 455,771 sentences in the training set and 172,448 in the test set.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Wikidata Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Denny Vrandecic. *Wikidata: a new platform for collaborative data collection*. In Proceedings of the 21st World Wide Web Conference, WWW 2012 (Companion Volume), pages 1063–1064, 2012.

- For the **NYT Freebase Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sebastian Riedel, Limin Yao, and Andrew McCallum. *Modeling Relations and Their Mentions without Labeled Text*. In Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, European Conference, ECML PKDD (Lecture Notes in Computer Science), Vol. 6323, pages 148–163, 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets along with their full citations as required.
