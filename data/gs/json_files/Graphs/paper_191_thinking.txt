To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CNN Acceleration by Low-Rank Approximation with Quantized Factors" by Nikolay Kozyrskiy and Anh-Huy Phan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Imagenet datasets**, which suggests that these datasets are relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 7, the authors provide specific information about the datasets used:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are mutually exclusive.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains the same images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class.

3. **Imagenet**: Specifically, the paper refers to the Imagenet-1k (ILSVRC), which contains approximately 1 million images across 1,000 object classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **Imagenet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sergey Ma, Zhi Huang, Andre Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
