To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VGCN-BERT: Augmenting BERT with Graph Embedding for Text Classification" by Zhibin Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several text classification datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors detail their methodology and the datasets used. In **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly list five datasets used for their experiments:

1. **SST-2**: The Stanford Sentiment Treebank is a binary single-sentence classification task consisting of sentences extracted from movie reviews with human annotations of their sentiment. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C.D., Ng, A., Potts, C. (2013). *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing (EMNLP), pp. 1631–1642.

2. **MR**: This is another movie review dataset for binary sentiment classification. The citation is:
   > Pang, B., Lee, L. (2005). *Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales*. In ACL, pp. 115–124.

3. **CoLA**: The Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability is a binary single-sentence classification task. The citation is:
   > Warstadt, A., Singh, A., Bowman, S.R. (2018). *Neural network acceptability judgments*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.12471.

4. **ArangoHate**: This dataset is a resampled dataset merging datasets from other sources for hate speech detection. The citation is:
   > Arango, A., Perez, J., Poblete, B. (2019). *Hate Speech Detection is Not as Easy as You May Think: A Closer Look at Model Validation*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Web and Social Media.

5. **FountaHate**: A large four-label dataset for hate speech and offensive language detection. The citation is:
   > Founta, A.M., Djouvas, C., Chatzakou, D., Leontiadis, I., Blackburn, J., Stringhini, G., Vakali, A., Sirivianos, M., Kourtellis, N. (2018). *Large scale crowdsourcing and characterization of twitter abusive behavior*. In Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Web and Social Media, ICWSM 2018.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note any additional details provided in the paper, such as the number of examples, average lengths, and any specific characteristics that may be relevant for understanding the datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
