To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Budget-Driven Hardware Optimization for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks using Stochastic Computing" by Zhe Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of implementing deep learning systems on resource-constrained devices, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section** to look for any datasets used in their evaluations.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors specifically mention using the **MNIST database** for their experiments, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. This is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, particularly for image classification tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST database is:

> Li Deng. *The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research*. In IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 29(6):141â€“142, 2012.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MNIST Database**: This dataset is widely used for training various image processing systems. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, each image being 28x28 pixels in grayscale.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entry according to the required format, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution. This process highlights the importance of thorough reading and cross-referencing within the paper to accurately extract and cite datasets.
