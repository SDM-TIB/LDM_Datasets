To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MER-GCN: Micro-Expression Recognition Based on Relation Modeling with Graph Convolutional Networks" by Ling Lo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of deep learning techniques for micro-expression recognition, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they state that they used the **CASME II dataset** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that this dataset is central to their research.

I will then look for a detailed description of the **CASME II dataset** within the text. The authors describe it as an improved version of the original CASME dataset, containing 247 micro-expressions from 35 subjects, with over 3,000 facial movements labeled based on Action Units (AUs). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and application.

After gathering the necessary details about the dataset, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CASME II dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> W.-J. Yan, X. Li, S.-J. Wang, G. Zhao, Y.-J. Liu, Y.-H. Chen, and X. Fu. *CASME II: An improved spontaneous micro-expression database and the baseline evaluation*. PLOS ONE, 9(1):e86041, 2014.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately extracted the dataset information, including the full citation, to maintain the integrity of the research and provide proper credit to the original dataset creators.
