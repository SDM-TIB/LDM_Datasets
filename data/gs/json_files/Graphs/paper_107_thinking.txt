To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stochastic Shared Embeddings: Data-driven Regularization of Embedding Layers" by Liwei Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and its applications, which may hint at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any textual descriptions that provide details about the datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets in the context of their experiments:

1. **Movielens1m**: This dataset is used for explicit feedback in recommendation tasks. It contains 1 million ratings from users on movies.

2. **Movielens10m**: This dataset is similar to Movielens1m but contains 10 million ratings, providing a larger scale for testing the proposed methods.

3. **Douban**: Another dataset used for recommendation tasks, though specific details about its size or structure are not provided in the main text.

4. **WMT 2014 English to German dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 4.5 million parallel sentence pairs used for neural machine translation tasks.

5. **IMDB movie reviews**: The authors crawled one million user reviews from IMDB for pre-training their BERT model.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be explicitly listed for datasets like Movielens or IMDB, but I will note the original sources where applicable.

For the **Movielens datasets**, the citations are:
- For **Movielens1m**:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The Movielens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):19, 2015.

- For **Movielens10m**:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The Movielens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):19, 2015.

For the **WMT dataset**, the citation is:
- For **WMT 2014 English to German dataset**:
  > Philipp Koehn, Christof Monz, and others. *Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. 2014.

For the **IMDB dataset**, the citation is:
- For **IMDB movie reviews**:
  > Andrew L. Maas, Jared N. Daly, and Jeffrey W. Ng. *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142â€“150, 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, as this is crucial for proper attribution and reproducibility in research.
