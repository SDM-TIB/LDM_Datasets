To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge Association with Hyperbolic Knowledge Graph Embeddings" by Zequn Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on entity alignment and type inference," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention two tasks: entity alignment and type inference. 

1. **DBP15K**: This dataset is used for the entity alignment task. The authors describe it as being extracted from DBpedia and consisting of three settings: ZH-EN (Chinese-English), JA-EN (Japanese-English), and FR-EN (French-English), each containing 15,000 pairs of entity alignments.

2. **YAGO26K-906**: This dataset is used for the type inference task. It is extracted from YAGO and consists of an entity-level KG and an ontological KG for concepts. The statistics of this dataset are also provided, indicating a total of 26,078 entities and 906 concepts.

3. **DB111K-174**: Another dataset for type inference, extracted from DBpedia. It contains 111,762 entities and 174 concepts, with a total of 863,643 triples.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **DBP15K**, the citation is:
  > Zequn Sun, Wei Hu, and Chengkai Li. *Cross-lingual entity alignment via joint attribute-preserving embedding*. In Proceedings of the International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC), pages 628–644, 2017.

- For **YAGO26K-906**, the citation is:
  > Junheng Hao, Chelsea Ju, Muhao Chen, Yizhou Sun, Carlo Zaniolo, and Wei Wang. *Universal representation learning of knowledge bases by jointly embedding instances and ontological concepts*. In Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), pages 1709–1719, 2019.

- For **DB111K-174**, the citation is:
  > Junheng Hao, Muhao Chen, Wenchao Yu, Yizhou Sun, and Wei Wang. *Bio-joie: Joint representation learning of biological knowledge bases*. In Proceedings of the 11th ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Biomedicine, 2020.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
