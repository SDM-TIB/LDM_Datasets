To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Drug repurposing for COVIDâ€‘19 using graph neural network and harmonizing multiple evidence" by Kanglin Hsieh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include mentions of datasets used for drug repurposing.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for drug repurposing and mention the **Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTDbase)** as a source for collecting drugs related to COVID-19 treatment. This indicates that CTDbase is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, where the authors describe how they built the COVID-19 knowledge graph. They mention collecting data on **27 SARS-CoV-2 baits, 322 host genes, 1783 host genes on 609 pathways, 3635 drugs, 4427 drug targets, and 1285 phenotypes**. This detailed enumeration suggests that these collections represent significant datasets.

In the **results section**, the authors highlight the top 22 drugs identified through their analysis, which may also reference datasets used for validation. They mention using **genetic profiles, in vitro experimental efficacy, and population-based treatment effects** for validation, indicating that these sources may also be considered datasets.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to various studies and databases, which may provide full citations for the datasets.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations:

1. **Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTDbase)**: This database was used to collect drugs related to COVID-19 treatment.

2. **COVID-19 Knowledge Graph**: This graph was built from curated COVID-19 literature and includes various interactions.

3. **Optum de-identified EHR database**: Used for population-based validation of treatment effects.

     > Optum. *Optum EHR data*. Available at: https://www.optum.com.

4. **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)**: Used for genetic validation of drug candidates.

5. **NCATS OpenData COVID-19 Portal**: Used for in vitro drug screening results.
   - Citation: 
     > National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). *OpenData COVID-19 Portal*. Available at: https://opendata.ncats.nih.gov/covid19.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation, ready for further processing or review.
