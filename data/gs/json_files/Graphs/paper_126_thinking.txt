To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Localizing Visual Sounds the Hard Way" by Honglie Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **Flickr SoundNet dataset** and introduce a new benchmark called **VGG-Sound Source (VGG-SS)**. This suggests that both datasets are important for the research.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, specifically focusing on any detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In the introduction, the authors mention that the VGG-SS benchmark is a new set of annotations for the VGG-Sound dataset, which is 20 times larger than existing datasets. This indicates that the VGG-Sound dataset is also significant in their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they use both the **Flickr SoundNet dataset** and the **VGG-Sound dataset** for training their models. They provide details about the number of videos and classes in each dataset, which is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Flickr SoundNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yusuf Aytar, Carl Vondrick, and Antonio Torralba. *Soundnet: Learning sound representations from unlabeled video*. In NeurIPS, 2016.

2. For the **VGG-Sound dataset**, the citation is:
   > Honglie Chen, Weidi Xie, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman. *VGG-Sound: A large-scale audio-visual dataset*. In Proc. ICASSP, 2020.

3. For the **VGG-Sound Source (VGG-SS)** benchmark, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
   > Honglie Chen, Weidi Xie, Triantafyllos Afouras, Arsha Nagrani, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman. *Localizing Visual Sounds the Hard Way*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
