To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TransGCN: Coupling Transformation Assumptions with Graph Convolutional Networks for Link Prediction" by Ling Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **FB15K-237** and **WN18RR**, which indicates that these datasets are likely important for the research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets and provide statistics about them. The relevant information is as follows:

1. **FB15K-237**: This dataset consists of 14,541 entities, 237 relations, and includes 272,115 training triples, 17,535 validation triples, and 20,466 test triples.

2. **WN18RR**: This dataset contains 40,943 entities, 11 relations, with 86,835 training triples, 3,034 validation triples, and 3,134 test triples.

To ensure accuracy, I will also check the **References section** for the full citations of the datasets. The authors mention that FB15K-237 and WN18RR are filtered versions of the original FB15K and WN18 datasets, respectively. The citations for these datasets are:

- For **FB15K-237**, the citation is:
  > Dettmers, T., Minervini, P., Stenetorp, P., & Riedel, S. (2018). Convolutional 2D Knowledge Graph Embeddings. In Proceedings of the 32nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-18), 1811–1818. https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01476

- For **WN18RR**, the citation is:
  > Bordes, A., Usunier, N., Garcia-Duran, A., Weston, J., & Yakhnenko, O. (2013). Translating embeddings for modeling multi-relational data. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2787–2795.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is captured accurately.
