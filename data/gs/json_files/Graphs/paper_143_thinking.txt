To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OPAL-Net: A Generative Model for Part-based Object Layout Generation" by Rishabh Baghel and Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that OPAL-Net is trained on the **PASCAL-Parts dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial to the research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions in the **experiments section**. In section 5, the authors explicitly mention that they use the **PASCAL-Part dataset**, which contains 10,103 images across 20 object categories annotated with part labels at the pixel level. They also specify the 10 object categories selected for their experiments: cow, bird, person, horse, sheep, cat, dog, airplane, bicycle, and motorbike. This section provides important context about how the dataset is used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PASCAL-Parts dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Chen, X., Mottaghi, R., Liu, X., Fidler, S., Urtasun, R., & Yuille, A. (2014). Detect what you can: Detecting and representing objects using holistic models and body parts. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 1971â€“1978.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the PASCAL-Parts dataset, I will create an entry for this dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for further processing or review.
