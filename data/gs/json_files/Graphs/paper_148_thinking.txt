To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MultiVERSE: a multiplex and multiplex-heterogeneous network embedding approach" by LÃ©o Pio-Lopez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation protocol section** (section 4), where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the context in which they were used.

In section 4.1.1 (Multiplex network datasets), the authors list several datasets used for evaluation:

1. **CKM physician innovation (CKM)**: A multiplex network describing how physicians in four towns in Illinois used the new drug tetracycline, composed of 3 layers corresponding to different questions asked to the physicians.

2. **Lazega network (LAZEGA)**: A multiplex social network composed of 3 layers based on co-working, friendship, and advice among partners in a corporate law partnership.

3. **Caenorabidis Elegans connectome (C.ELE)**: A neuronal multiplex network composed of 3 layers corresponding to different synaptic junctions.

4. **ArXiv network (ARXIV)**: Composed of 8 layers corresponding to different ArXiv categories, restricted to papers with 'networks' in the title or abstract.

5. **Homo sapiens network (HOMO)**: Composed of 4 layers extracted from the original network on CoMuNe Lab, keeping physical association, direct interaction, association, and co-localization layers.

6. **Disease multiplex network (DIS)**: Constructed from a disease-drug network, consisting of 3 layers based on disease-disease relationships.

7. **Human molecular multiplex network (MOL)**: A molecular network consisting of 3 layers, including protein-protein interactions, pathways, and molecular complexes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
