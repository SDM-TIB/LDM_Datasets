To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Open Domain Recognition by Semantic Discrepancy Minimization" by Junbao Zhuo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a method evaluated on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **I2AwA**: This dataset is a replacement for the original AwA dataset for zero-shot learning, consisting of 50 animal classes with a total of 37,322 images. The authors specify that they use a proposed split where 40 classes are known and 10 are unknown.

2. **I2WebV**: This dataset's source domain is ILSVRC-2012, which contains 1,279,847 images across 1,000 classes. The target domain is the validation set of WebVision, comprising 294,009 images across 5,000 classes. The authors note that this dataset presents significant challenges due to domain discrepancies.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **I2AwA**, the citation is:
  > Xian, Y., Schiele, B., & Akata, Z. (2017). *Zero-shot learningâ€”the good, the bad and the ugly*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.04394.

- For **WebVision**, the citation is:
  > Li, W., Wang, L., Li, W., Agustsson, E., & Van Gool, L. (2017). *Webvision database: Visual learning and understanding from web data*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.02862.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
