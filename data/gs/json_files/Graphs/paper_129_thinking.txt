To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatio-Temporal Crop Classification on Volumetric Data" by Muhammad Usman Qadeer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on **Yolo and Imperial county benchmark datasets**, indicating that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional context or details about these datasets. The introduction discusses the use of multispectral satellite imagery and mentions the importance of crop classification, but it primarily reiterates the datasets mentioned in the abstract.

Moving to the **methodology section**, I will look for specific details about how the datasets were used. The authors state that they used crop survey data provided by the California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) for both Imperial County and Yolo County, which confirms the datasets' relevance.

In the **results section**, the authors provide a comparative analysis of their proposed method using the datasets, further solidifying their importance in the study. They mention that the datasets were split into training and testing sets, which is crucial for understanding their application.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The paper cites the California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) for the crop survey data, which is essential for proper attribution.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> California Department of Water Resources (CDWR). *2016 statewide crop mapping GIS shapefiles*. Accessed Jan. 07, 2020 [online], Available: https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/statewide-crop-mapping.

Since the paper primarily focuses on these two datasets (Yolo and Imperial County), I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CDWR dataset.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that the citations are correctly formatted and attributed.
