To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Movement Strategies for Moving Target Defense," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a game-theoretic model and a learning approach but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the context of Moving Target Defense (MTD) and the need for effective strategies, but again, there are no specific datasets mentioned.

I will then move on to the **experiments** section, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this section, the authors describe two scenarios for MTD: one for web-application security and another for cloud networks. They mention using a game simulator based on parameters from previous works, but they do not provide specific datasets.

In the **modeling sections** (2.1.1 and 2.1.2), the authors refer to existing works and datasets indirectly, such as the Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) database, but they do not provide a new dataset or a specific dataset name.

Next, I will check the **references** section to see if any datasets are cited. The references include various papers that may have datasets related to MTD, but they do not explicitly mention new datasets created for this study.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that while the authors reference existing datasets (like the CVE database), they do not introduce any new datasets or provide specific datasets used in their experiments. Therefore, I will note that no new datasets were extracted from this paper.

Finally, I will compile my findings into a structured format, ensuring to include any relevant citations for the existing datasets mentioned, particularly the CVE database, which is a crucial resource in cybersecurity research.

The citation for the CVE database is:
> National Vulnerability Database. *Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)*. Available at: https://nvd.nist.gov.

In conclusion, I will summarize that the paper does not present new datasets but references existing ones, particularly the CVE database, which is essential for understanding vulnerabilities in the context of Moving Target Defense.
