To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Directional Message Passing for Molecular Graphs" by Johannes Gasteiger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the proposed method, DimeNet, outperforms previous models on two benchmarks: **MD17** and **QM9**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors discuss the datasets in the **experiments section**. They specifically mention:

1. **QM9**: A dataset consisting of approximately 130,000 molecules used for predicting molecular properties. The authors note that they use 110,000 molecules for training, 10,000 for validation, and 10,831 for testing.

2. **MD17**: This dataset is used for testing model performance in molecular dynamics simulations. It includes data for eight small organic molecules and is commonly used with 50,000 training and 10,000 validation and test samples.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **QM9**, the citation is:
  > Ramakrishnan, R., Dral, P. O., Rupp, M., & von Lilienfeld, O. A. (2014). Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules. *Scientific Data*, 1(1), 1-7.

- For **MD17**, the citation is:
  > Chmiela, S., Tkatchenko, A., Sauceda, H. E., Poltavsky, I., Schütt, K. T., & Müller, K.-R. (2017). Machine learning of accurate energy-conserving molecular force fields. *Science Advances*, 3(5), e1603015.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
