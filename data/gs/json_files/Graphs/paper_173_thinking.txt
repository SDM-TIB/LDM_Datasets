To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VERSE: Versatile Graph Embeddings from Similarity Measures" by Anton Tsitsulin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention testing their methods on six real datasets. This is a strong indication that specific datasets will be detailed in this section. I will look for a subsection that lists these datasets and their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **BlogCatalog**: A network of social interactions among bloggers, with node labels representing topic categories provided by authors.

2. **Microsoft Academic Graph (CoAuthor and CoCit)**: A network of academic papers, citations, authors, and affiliations. CoAuthor is a co-authorship network, while CoCit is a network of papers citing other papers.

3. **VK**: A Russian social network, with two snapshots taken at different times to analyze link appearance.

4. **YouTube**: A network of social interactions among users of the YouTube platform, with labels representing groups of viewers by video genres.

5. **Orkut**: A social network where the largest communities are used as labels for classification.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be directly provided in the paper, but I will look for any references that might lead to the original sources of these datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **BlogCatalog**: 
  > Zafarani, R., & Liu, H. (2009). Social Computing Data Repository at ASU. Retrieved from http://socialcomputing.asu.edu

- **Microsoft Academic Graph**: 
  > Microsoft Academic Graph - KDD cup 2016. (2016). Retrieved from https://kddcup2016.azurewebsites.net/Data

- **VK**: 
  > No specific citation is provided in the paper, but it is a well-known Russian social network.

- **YouTube**: 
  > No specific citation is provided in the paper, but it is a widely used platform.

- **Orkut**: 
  > No specific citation is provided in the paper, but it was a popular social network before its discontinuation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
