To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hybrid Graph Neural Network Approach for Detecting PHP Vulnerabilities" by Rishi Rabheru et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on both a synthetic dataset and a novel real-world dataset collected from GitHub. This suggests that there are at least two datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **datasets section (IV)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **SARD Dataset**: This is a synthetic dataset from the Software Assurance Reference Dataset project, specifically for PHP vulnerabilities. The authors describe it as containing both safe and unsafe samples for different vulnerability types, generated by a tool called the PHP Vulnerability Test Suite Generator.

2. **GitHub Dataset**: This dataset consists of real-world PHP projects collected from GitHub, specifically targeting vulnerabilities such as SQL injection (SQLi), Cross-site scripting (XSS), and OS Command Injection (OSCI). The authors explain their methodology for extracting vulnerable and non-vulnerable samples from GitHub repositories.

In the **conclusion** section, the authors summarize their findings and mention the datasets again, reinforcing their importance in the evaluation of their model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SARD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bertrand C. Stivalet. *PHP Vulnerability Test Suite*. [Accessed April 10, 2020]. Available: https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/view.php?tsID=103.

- For the **GitHub Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is derived from various GitHub repositories and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). I will note that the authors used CVE entries for vulnerabilities, which can be cited as:
  > MITRE. *CVE - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures*. [Accessed April 10, 2020]. Available: https://cve.mitre.org/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
