To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A new dataset of literary events" by David Bamman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a new dataset of literary events, which suggests that a specific dataset will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **data section** where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of approximately the first 2000 words of 100 literary works published before 1923, which is a significant dataset for literary analysis.In the **data section**, the authors provide specific details about the dataset, including the number of tokens (210,532) and the source of the texts (Project Gutenberg). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and purpose.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the Project Gutenberg corpus as the source of the texts, which is a well-known repository of public domain literature. The citation for the Project Gutenberg corpus is:> Project Gutenberg. *Project Gutenberg*. Available at: https://www.gutenberg.org/Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the details provided in the paper, ensuring to include the full citation for the Project Gutenberg corpus.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that all relevant information is included for clarity and completeness.
