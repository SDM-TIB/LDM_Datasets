To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QE BERT: Bilingual BERT using Multi-task Learning for Neural Quality Estimation" by Hyun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **WMT19 QE dataset**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention using the **WMT19 QE Shared Task** for their experiments, which is a well-known dataset in the field of machine translation quality estimation. They also reference the **WMT19 news machine translation task** as a source of parallel data for pre-training their model.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the WMT19 QE dataset. The citation for the WMT19 QE dataset is:- For **WMT19 QE dataset**, the citation is: > Hyun Kim, Hun-Young Jung, Hongseok Kwon, Jong-Hyeok Lee, and Seung-Hoon Na. *Predictor-estimator: Neural quality estimation based on target word prediction for machine translation*. ACM Trans. Asian Low-Resour. Lang. Inf. Process., 17(1):3:1a3:22, 2017.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
