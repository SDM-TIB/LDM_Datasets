To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unified Language Model Pre-training for Natural Language Understanding and Generation" by Li Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the pre-training of a unified language model (UNILM) and mentions its performance on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention several datasets for their experiments, including:1. **CNN/DailyMail**: This dataset is used for abstractive summarization tasks. The authors state that they used the non-anonymized version of this dataset for their experiments.2. **Gigaword**: Another dataset used for abstractive summarization, specifically for evaluating the model's performance in this task.3. **SQuAD 2.0**: This dataset is referenced for extractive question answering tasks. The authors mention that they fine-tuned their model on this dataset.4. **CoQA**: This dataset is used for generative question answering tasks, where the authors adapted their model to handle conversational question answering.5. **DSTC7**: This dataset is utilized for document-grounded dialog response generation tasks.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For **CNN/DailyMail**, the citation is: > Abigail See, Peter J. Liu, and Christopher D. Manning. *Get to the point: Summarization with pointer-generator networks*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 1073a1083, Vancouver, Canada, July 2017. Association for Computational Linguistics.- For **Gigaword**, the citation is: > Alexander M. Rush, Sumit Chopra, and Jason Weston. *A neural attention model for abstractive sentence summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 379a389, Lisbon, Portugal, September 2015. Association for Computational Linguistics.- For **SQuAD 2.0**, the citation is: > Pranav Rajpurkar, Robin Jia, and Percy Liang. *Know what you donâ€™t know: Unanswerable questions for SQuAD*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 784a789, Melbourne, Australia, July 15-20, 2018, Volume 2: Short Papers, pages 784a789, 2018. Association for Computational Linguistics.- For **CoQA**, the citation is: > Siva Reddy, Danqi Chen, and Christopher D. Manning. *CoQA: A conversational question answering challenge*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 7:249a266, March 2019.- For **DSTC7**, the citation is: > Lianhui Qin, Michel Galley, Chris Brockett, Xiaodong Liu, Xiang Gao, Bill Dolan, Yejin Choi, and Jianfeng Gao. *Conversing by reading: Contentful neural conversation with on-demand machine reading*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 5427a5436, Florence, Italy, July 2019. Association for Computational Linguistics.After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
