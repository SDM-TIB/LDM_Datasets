To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal Dependencies According to BERT: Both More Specific and More General" by Tomasz Limisiewicz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the analysis of syntactic abstraction in BERT and mentions the use of various datasets for evaluation, which indicates that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **data section** (section 2) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets, including:1. **EuroParl**: A parallel corpus for statistical machine translation, used for head selection in English, German, French, Czech, and Finnish.2. **Google Universal Dependency Treebanks (GSD)**: Used for Indonesian, Korean, and Japanese.3. **UD Turkish Treebank (IMST-UD)**: Used for Turkish.4. **CoNLL2017 Shared Task**: Used for evaluation of mBERT in all languages.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:- For **EuroParl**, the citation is: > Philipp Koehn. *EuroParl: A parallel corpus for statistical machine translation*. 2004.- For **Google Universal Dependency Treebanks (GSD)**, the citation is: > Ryan McDonald, Joakim Nivre, Yvonne Quirmbach-Brundage, Yoav Goldberg, Dipanjan Das, Kuzman Ganchev, Keith Hall, Slav Petrov, Hao Zhang, Oscar Tackström, Claudia Bedini, Nöra Bertomeu Castelló, and Jungmee Lee. *Universal dependency annotation for multilingual parsing*. In Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers), pages 92a97, Sofia, Bulgaria, 2013.- For **UD Turkish Treebank (IMST-UD)**, the citation is: > Umut Sulubacak, Gülsün Eryılmaz, and Tuğba Pamay. *IMST-UD: A revisited Turkish dependency treebank*. In Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Turkic Computational Linguistics, pages 1a6, Turkey, 2016.- For **CoNLL2017 Shared Task**, the citation is: > Joakim Nivre, Marie-Catherine De Marneffe, Filip Ginter, Yoav Goldberg, Jan Hajic, Christopher D. Manning, Ryan McDonald, Slav Petrov, Sampo Pyysalo, Natalia Silveira, et al. *Universal dependencies 2.0 a CoNLL2017 shared task development and test data*. LINDAT/CLARIN digital library at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (AFAL), Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, 2017.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
