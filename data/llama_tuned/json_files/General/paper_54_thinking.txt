To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal Transforming Geometric Network for Protein Structure Prediction" by Jin Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed Universal Transforming Geometric Network (UTGN) and mentions its evaluation on the CASP12 competition, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the author explicitly states that the model is evaluated on the **CASP12 ProteinNet dataset**. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of the proposed model.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CASP12 dataset. The relevant citation is:- For **CASP12 ProteinNet dataset**, the citation is: > Mohammed AlQuraishi. *Proteinnet: a standardized data set for machine learning of protein structure*. In BMC Bioinformatics, 2019.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset name and its citation from the paper.
