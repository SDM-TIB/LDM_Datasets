To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Make Generalizable and Diverse Predictions for Retrosynthesis" by Benson Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on the **USPTO-50k dataset**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 5.1) where the authors describe the datasets used. They mention using the **USPTO-50k dataset**, which is a curated subset of the USPTO patent database of chemical reactions. This section provides details about the dataset, including its purpose and the preprocessing steps taken.In the **references section**, I will look for the full citation of the USPTO-50k dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:- For the **USPTO-50k dataset**, the citation is: > Bowen Liu, Bharath Ramsundar, Prasad Kawthekar, Jade Shi, Joseph Gomes, Quang Luu Nguyen, Stephen Ho, Jack Sloane, Paul Wender, and Vijay Pande. *Retrosynthetic reaction prediction using neural sequence-to-sequence models*. ACS Central Science, 3(10):1103a1113, 2017. doi:10.1021/acscentsci.7b00303. PMID: 29104927.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and citation from the paper.
