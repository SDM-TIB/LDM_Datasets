To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning in Biomedical Named Entity Recognition: An Evaluation of BERT in the PharmaCoNER task" by Cong Sun and Zhihao Yang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **PharmaCoNER corpus**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their research.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned. The introduction discusses the PharmaCoNER task and its relevance to biomedical named entity recognition, reinforcing the importance of the PharmaCoNER corpus.In the **methods section**, the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments, specifically stating that they used the **PharmaCoNER corpus**. They mention that this corpus has been randomly sampled into three subsets: the training set, development set, and test set, which contains 500 clinical cases for training and 250 clinical cases for evaluation and testing.I will also check the **results section** to confirm the dataset's usage and any additional datasets that may have been referenced. The authors provide details about the PharmaCoNER corpus, including its structure and the number of clinical cases in each subset.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the PharmaCoNER corpus. The citation is as follows:> Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre, Montserrat Marimon, Ander Intxaurrondo, Obdulia Rabal, Marta Villegas, and Martin Krallinger. *PharmaCoNER: Pharmacological substances, compounds and proteins named in Spanish biomedical texts*. In Proceedings of the BioNLP Open Shared Tasks (BioNLP-OST), 2019.Since the paper primarily focuses on the PharmaCoNER corpus, I will compile the dataset entry with the citation. The dataset entry will include the name of the dataset, a brief description, and the full citation.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that I include all necessary details for clarity and completeness.
