To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Regularized Context Gates on Transformer for Machine Translation" by Xintong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **four translation datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention that they conducted experiments on **four benchmark datasets**. I will look for the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided about their structure and content.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluations:1. **WMT14 EN**: This dataset is used for English to English translation tasks.2. **IWSLT17 FR**: This dataset is utilized for French to English translation tasks.3. **DE task**: The authors refer to a dataset for German to English translation tasks, but they do not provide a specific name. I will need to look for the full citation in the references.4. **EN task**: Similar to the DE task, this dataset is for English to English translation tasks, but again, the specific name is not provided in the text. I will need to find the citation for this dataset as well.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For **WMT14 EN**, the citation is: > WMT 2014: English- German Machine Translation Shared Task.- For **IWSLT17 FR**, the citation is: > IWSLT 2017: English-French Machine Translation Shared Task.- For the **DE task**, I will look for a relevant citation, but it appears that the authors do not provide a specific name for this dataset in the text. I will need to search for a general reference for German-English translation tasks.- For the **EN task**, similar to the DE task, the authors do not provide a specific name, so I will look for a general reference for English-English translation tasks.Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as I find them. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their respective citations, which is crucial for proper attribution and further research.
