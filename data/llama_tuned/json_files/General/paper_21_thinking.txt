To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Simple but Effective Method to Incorporate Multi-turn Context with BERT for Conversational Machine Comprehension" by Yasuhito Ohsugi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets, which suggests that I should look for their names and details.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to gather more context about the datasets. The authors mention two datasets, **QuAC** and **CoQA**, which are specifically used for conversational machine comprehension (CMC). This is a strong indication that these datasets are central to the research.I will then examine the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used for evaluation. The authors state that they conducted experiments on both **QuAC** and **CoQA**, which reinforces their importance in the study.Now, I will look at the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:1. For **QuAC**, the citation is: > Eunsol Choi, He He, Mohit Iyyer, Mark Yatskar, Wen-tau Yih, Yejin Choi, Percy Liang, and Luke Zettle-moyer. *QuAC: Question answering in context*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2174a2184, 2018.2. For **CoQA**, the citation is: > Siva Reddy, Danqi Chen, and Christopher D. Manning. *CoQA: A conversational question answering challenge*. CoRR, abs/1808.07042, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
