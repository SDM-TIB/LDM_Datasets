To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FQuAD: French Question Answering Dataset" by Martin daHoischmidt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset collection sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the FQuAD dataset, which is a French native Reading Comprehension dataset, indicating that this is a primary dataset of interest.Next, I will focus on the **dataset collection section** where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that FQuAD consists of 25,000+ samples for the 1.0 version and 60,000+ samples for the 1.1 version, which provides a clear understanding of the dataset's scope and scale.In the **dataset evaluation section**, the authors discuss the performance metrics and the human performance on the test set, reinforcing the significance of FQuAD for evaluating Reading Comprehension models. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the FQuAD dataset. The citation is as follows:- For **FQuAD**, the citation is: > Martin daHoischmidt, Wacim Belblidia, Tom Brendl, Quentin Heinrich, Illuin Technology. *FQuAD: French Question Answering Dataset*. 2022. Available at: https://illuin-tech.github.io/FQuAD-explorer/.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for FQuAD as it is the only dataset discussed in the paper.
