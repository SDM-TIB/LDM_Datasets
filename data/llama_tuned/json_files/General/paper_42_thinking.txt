To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CRAM: Clued Recurrent Attention Model" by Minki Chung and Sungzoon Choa, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed model and its evaluation on two computer vision tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the need for a model that can efficiently solve problems in computer vision tasks, but they do not specify datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section** where they describe the tasks and datasets used for evaluation.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:1. **MSRA10k Dataset**: This dataset is used for saliency detection and is described as the largest publicly available saliency detection dataset, containing 10,000 annotated saliency images.2. **Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset**: This dataset is used for object recognition and contains 73,257 training digits and 26,032 testing digits, all of size 32x32 in RGB color scale.I will now check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For the **MSRA10k Dataset**, the citation is: > M.-M. Cheng, N. J. Mitra, X. Huang, P. H. Torr, and S.-M. Hu. *Global contrast based salient region detection*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 37(3):569a582, 2015.- For the **Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
