To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Token-Level Ensemble Distillation for Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion" by Hao Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **CMU-Dict dataset** and an **internal dataset**, which suggests that these are the datasets used in the research.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets. Here, they explicitly mention:1. **CMU-Dict 0.7b**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method, and the authors provide details about its structure, including the number of training, validation, and test words.2. **Internal Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 184,243 training words, 10,837 validation words, and 21,678 test words, along with the sizes of the grapheme and phoneme vocabularies.3. I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **CMU-Dict 0.7b**, the citation is: > K. Yao and G. Zweig. *Sequence-to-sequence neural network models for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.00196, 2015.- For the **Internal Dataset**, since it is not a publicly available dataset, I will note that it is an internal dataset created by the authors of this paper, and I will document it accordingly.Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the CMU-Dict dataset and a description of the internal dataset as detailed in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
