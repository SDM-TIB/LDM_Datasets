To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer-based Automatic Post-Editing Model with Joint Encoder and Multi-source Attention of Decoder" by WonKee Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed model and mentions experiments conducted on the **WMT19 English-German APE dataset**, indicating that this is a key dataset used in their research.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention two datasets:1. **WMT19 English-German APE dataset**: This dataset is used for automatic post-editing tasks and consists of a training and development set. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of sentence triplets and TER scores.2. **eSCAPE-NMT dataset**: This dataset is used as additional training data, and the authors describe how they filtered it to meet specific criteria for sentence triplets.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **WMT19 English-German APE dataset**, the citation is: > Rajen Chatterjee, Matteo Negri, Raphael Rubino, and Marco Turchi. *Findings of the WMT 2018 Shared Task on Automatic Post-Editing*. In Proceedings of the Third Conference on Machine Translation: Shared Task Papers, page 710-725, 2018.- For the **eSCAPE-NMT dataset**, the citation is: > Matteo Negri, Marco Turchi, Rajen Chatterjee, and Nicola Bertoldi. *ESCAPE: a Large-scale Synthetic Corpus for Automatic Post-Editing*. In International Proceedings of Conference and on Evaluation (LREC-2018), 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
