To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning for Causal Sentence Detection" by Manolis Kyriakakis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors focus on causal sentence detection and mention the use of generic public relation extraction datasets and a new biomedical causal sentence detection dataset, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods section**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the scarcity of causal instances in relation extraction datasets, which implies that they may reference specific datasets used for their experiments. In the **methods section**, they explicitly mention several datasets used for evaluation, including:1. **SemEval-2010**: This dataset contains 10,674 samples, with 1,325 causal sentences annotated with a pair of entities and their relationship.2. **CausalTB**: This dataset was used to identify causal sentences, containing 2,470 sentences, with 244 causal sentences.3. **EventSL**: This dataset was created to detect causal sentences from the Event StoryLine corpus, resulting in 4,107 sentences, with 77 causal sentences.4. **BioCausal**: The authors developed a new biomedical causal sentence detection dataset, BioCausal-Large, which includes 13,342 sentences, with 7,562 causal sentences. They also mention a publicly available subset, BioCausal-Small, containing 2,000 sentences with 1,113 causal sentences.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For **SemEval-2010**, the citation is: > Hendrickx, I., Kim, S. N., Kozareva, Z., Nakov, P., O'SAeghdha, D., PadA, S.,... & Szpakowicz, S. (2009). *SemEval-2010 Task 8: Multi-way classification of semantic relations between pairs of nominals*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Semantic Evaluations: Recent Achievements and Future Directions, pages 94a99, Boulder, Colorado.- For **CausalTB**, the citation is: > Mirza, P., Sprugnoli, R., Tonelli, S., & Speranza, M. (2014). *Annotating causality in the temporal-3 corpus*. In Proceedings of the EACL Workshop on Computational Approaches to Causality in Language (CAtoCL), pages 10a19.- For **EventSL**, the citation is: > Caselli, T., & Vossen, P. (2017). *The event storyline corpus: A new benchmark for causal and temporal relation extraction*. In Proceedings of the Events and Stories in the News Workshop, pages 77a86, Vancouver, Canada.- For **BioCausal**, the citation is: > Kyriakakis, M., Androutsopoulos, I., GinAes, J., & Saudabayev, A. (2023). *Transfer Learning for Causal Sentence Detection*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Pages], [Location].After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
