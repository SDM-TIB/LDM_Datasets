To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Transformers for Diverse Response Generation" by Zhaojiang Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their models on three conversational datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they list the datasets as follows:1. **Mojitalk**: This dataset consists of 596,959 post and response pairs from Twitter, with each response labeled by an emoji indicating the response emotion. The authors mention that they use the preprocessed data and vocabulary released by Zhou and Wang (2018).2. **PersonaChat**: This dataset is described as one-to-one multi-turn conversation datasets where conversations revolve around personas established by four to six persona sentences.3. **Empathetic-Dialogues**: This dataset is also a one-to-one multi-turn conversation dataset, focusing on empathetic responses to situations that happened to one of the speakers, with the goal of making users more engaging.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **Mojitalk**, the citation is: > Xianda Zhou and William Yang Wang. *Mojitalk: In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1128a1137, 2018.- For **PersonaChat**, the citation is: > Biao Zhang, Deyi Xiong, Hong Duan, Min Zhang, et al. *PersonaChat: In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 2204a2213, 2018.- For **Empathetic-Dialogues**, the citation is: > Hannah Rashkin, Eric Michael Smith, Margaret Li, and Y-Lan Boureau. *Towards empathetic open-domain conversation models: A new benchmark and dataset*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 5370a5381, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
