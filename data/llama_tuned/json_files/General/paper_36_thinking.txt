To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta Answering for Machine Reading" by Benjamin Borschinger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the framework for meta answering and mentions the **Natural Questions dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors reference the **Natural Questions dataset** again, confirming its significance in their research. In the experiments section, they explicitly state that they use the **Natural Questions dataset** for their evaluations, which further solidifies its importance.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the **Natural Questions dataset**, describing it as a benchmark for question answering research. They mention that it embeds real users' information-seeking needs in a realistic information retrieval context, which is crucial for understanding its application in their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Natural Questions dataset**. The citation is as follows:> Tom Kwiatkowski, Jennimaria Palomaki, Olivia Redfield, Michael Collins, Ankur Parikh, Chris Alberti, Danielle Epstein, Illia Polosukhin, Matthew Kelcey, Jacob Devlin, Kenton Lee, Kristina N. Toutanova, Lion Jones, Ming-Wei Chang, Andrew Dai, Jakob Uszkoreit, Quoc Le, and Slav Petrov. *Natural Questions: A Benchmark for Question Answering Research*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019.With this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the **Natural Questions dataset**, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
