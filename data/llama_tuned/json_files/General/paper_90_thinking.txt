To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transforming Delete, Retrieve, Generate Approach for Controlled TextStyle Transfer" by Akhilesh Sudhakar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using the following datasets:1. **YELP Dataset**: This dataset consists of reviews of businesses on Yelp, with each review labeled as having either positive or negative sentiment.2. **AMAZON Dataset**: This dataset contains product reviews on Amazon, also labeled as having positive or negative sentiment.3. **CAPTIONS Dataset**: This dataset includes image captions, where each caption is labeled as either factual, romantic, or humorous.4. **POLITICAL Dataset**: This dataset consists of top-level comments on Facebook posts from members of the United States Senate and House, labeled as having been posted by either a Republican or a Democrat politician.5. **GENDER Dataset**: This dataset contains reviews of food businesses on Yelp, labeled as either male or female.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:- For the **YELP Dataset**, the citation is: > Li, J., Monroe, W., & Jurafsky, D. (2018). Delete, retrieve, generate: a simple approach to sentiment and style transfer. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1865a1874, New Orleans, Louisiana.- For the **AMAZON Dataset**, the citation is: > Li, J., Monroe, W., & Jurafsky, D. (2018). Delete, retrieve, generate: a simple approach to sentiment and style transfer. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1865a1874, New Orleans, Louisiana.- For the **CAPTIONS Dataset**, the citation is: > Li, J., Monroe, W., & Jurafsky, D. (2018). Delete, retrieve, generate: a simple approach to sentiment and style transfer. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1865a1874, New Orleans, Louisiana.- For the **POLITICAL Dataset**, the citation is: > Prabhumoye, S., Tsvetkov, Y., Salakhutdinov, R. S., & Black, A. W. (2018). Transfer through back-translation. In Proceedings of the ACL.- For the **GENDER Dataset**, the citation is: > Reddy, S., & Knight, K. (2016). Obfuscating gender in social media writing. In Proceedings of the First Workshop on NLP and Computational Social Science, pages 17a26, Austin, Texas.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
