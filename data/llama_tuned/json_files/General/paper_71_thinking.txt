To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Train, Sort, Explain: Learning to Diagnose Translation Models" by Robert Schwarzenberg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of translation models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, particularly in the context of machine translation.Next, I will focus on the **datasets section** (section 4) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe the datasets in detail, including their sources and characteristics.In section 4, the authors mention two datasets:1. **WMT14 data setup**: This dataset is used for training and evaluating the neural machine translation model. It is derived from the WMT 2014 shared task on machine translation.2. **WMT18 training data**: This dataset is used for training the CNN text classifier. It includes human references and machine translations alongside their sources, specifically from the WMT18 training data.The authors also reference the **WMT13 test set** for evaluation, which is part of the WMT 2013 shared task.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For **WMT14 data setup**, the citation is: > Ondrej Bojar, Christian Buck, Christian Federmann, Barry Haddow, Philipp Koehn, Johannes Leveling, Christof Monz, Pavel Pecina, Matt Post, Herve Saint-Amand, Radu Soricut, Lucia Specia, and AleEs Tamchyna. *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 12a58, Baltimore, Maryland, USA, 2014.- For **WMT18 training data**, the citation is: > Ondrej Bojar, Christian Federmann, Mark Fishel, Yvette Graham, Barry Haddow, Matthias Huck, Philipp Koehn, and Christof Monz. *Findings of the 2018 conference on machine translation*. In Proceedings of the Third Conference on Machine Translation, Volume 2: Shared Task Papers, pages 272a307, Belgium, Brussels, 2018.- For **WMT13 test set**, the citation is: > Ondrej Bojar, Christian Buck, Christian Federmann, Barry Haddow, Matthias Huck, Philipp Koehn, Johannes Leveling, Christof Monz, Pavel Pecina, Matt Post, Herve Saint-Amand, Radu Soricut, Lucia Specia, and AleEs Tamchyna. *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 12a58, Baltimore, Maryland, USA, 2014.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
