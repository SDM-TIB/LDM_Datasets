To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VectorQuantized Autoencoders for Machine Translation" by Aukasz Kaiser et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of vector quantized autoencoders (VQ-VAE) for machine translation, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **WMT English-German translation task** and the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for image reconstruction tasks. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:1. **WMT English-German Translation Task**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks, specifically for evaluating the performance of their VQ-VAE model.2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for image reconstruction tasks, where the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in generating images from latent codes.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **WMT English-German Translation Task**, the citation is: > Aukasz Kaiser, Aurko Roy, Ashish Vaswani, Niki Pamar, Samy Bengio, Jakob Uszkoreit, and Noam Shazeer. *Fast decoding in sequence models using discrete latent variables*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.03382, 2018.- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, 2009.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
