To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention is Not Only a Weight: Analyzing Transformers with Vector Norms" by Goro Kobayashi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the analysis of attention mechanisms in Transformers, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of NLP tasks.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4 and 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **BERT-base dataset** for their analyses, specifically in Section 4.1, where they analyze the attention mechanisms in BERT. They also refer to the **Europarl v7 corpus** for their NMT experiments in Section 5.1.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used:1. **BERT-base dataset**: This dataset is used for analyzing the attention mechanisms in BERT. The authors mention that they analyzed a model with 12 layers, each containing 12 attention heads, and they used the data provided by Clark et al. (2019) for their analysis.2. **Europarl v7 corpus**: This dataset is utilized for training a Transformer-based NMT system for German-to-English translation. The authors specify that they used the gold alignment dataset provided by Vilar et al. (2006) for their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For the **BERT-base dataset**, the citation is: > Kevin Clark, Urvashi Khandelwal, Omer Levy, and Christopher D Manning. *What Does BERT Look At? An Analysis of BERT as Attention*. In Proceedings of the 2019 ACL Workshop Blackbox NLP: Analyzing and Interpreting Neural Networks for NLP, pages 276a286.- For the **Europarl v7 corpus**, the citation is: > David Vilar, Maja PopoviÄ‡, and Hermann Ney. *AER: Do we need to aim for improved alignments?*. In International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT) 2006, pages 205a212.After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
