To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding the Behaviors of BERT in Ranking" by Yifan Qiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two ranking tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled "Datasets." Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used in their experiments:1. **MS MARCO**: This dataset is described as containing 1,010,916 training queries and a million expert-annotated answer passage relevance labels. It is used for the passage reranking task.2. **ClueWeb**: This dataset includes documents from ClueWeb09-B and queries from the TREC Web Track ad hoc retrieval task from 2009 to 2012. It is used for the ad hoc document ranking task.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **MS MARCO**, the citation is: > Rodrigo Nogueira and Kyunghyun Cho. *Passage Re-ranking with BERT*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.04085 (2019).- For **ClueWeb**, the citation is: > Zhuyun Dai, Chenyan Xiong, Jamie Callan, and Zhiyuan Liu. *Convolutional Neural Networks for Soft-Matching N-Grams in Ad-hoc Search*. In Proceedings of WSDM 2018. ACM, 126a134.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
