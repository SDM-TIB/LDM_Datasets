To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-tuning BERT for Joint Entity and Relation Extraction in Chinese Medical Text" by Kui Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental studies sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on coronary angiography texts collected from Shuguang Hospital, which suggests that this is a dataset used in their research.Next, I will focus on the **experimental studies section** where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of coronary arteriography reports, specifying that it includes five types of entities (Body Part, Degree, Quantity, Location, and No Relation) and six types of relations (Negative, Modifier, Position, Percentage, and No Relation). This section provides a clear description of the dataset's structure and content.In the **dataset and evaluation metrics section**, the authors provide a table summarizing the statistics of the entities and relations, which further confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments. They also mention that 85% of the "No Relation" entities were discarded for balance purposes, which is important for understanding the dataset's context.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference their own work and other relevant studies, but they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself. However, they do mention that the dataset is collected from Shuguang Hospital, which may lead to a citation for the hospital or the dataset if available.Since the dataset is not explicitly cited in the references, I will note that the dataset is derived from a specific hospital and may require additional research to find the original source or citation.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the information gathered, ensuring to include the description and any relevant details about the dataset's structure and purpose in the context of the research paper.
