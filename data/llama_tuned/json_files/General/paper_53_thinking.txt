To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cost-Sensitive BERT for Generalisable Sentence Classification with Imbalanced Data" by Harish Tayyar Madabushi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their methods on the **Propaganda Techniques Corpus (PTC)**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their research.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections** to gather more details about the dataset. In the introduction, the authors mention the PTC dataset in the context of propaganda detection, confirming its significance in their experiments.In the **methods section**, they provide a detailed description of the PTC dataset, including the number of news articles, sentences, and the specific tasks they used it for (sentence-level classification and fragment-level classification). This section will help me understand the dataset's structure and purpose.I will also check the **dataset description** for any additional details, such as the source of the dataset, the number of samples, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Propaganda Techniques Corpus (PTC)**. The citation is as follows:> Giovanni Da San Martino, Seunghak Yu, Alberto Barrón-Cedeño, Rostislav Petrov, and Preslav Nakov. *Fine-grained analysis of propaganda in news articles*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019), pages 1-10, 2019. https://propaganda.qcri.org/nlp4if-shared-task/quAfter gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation for the PTC dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
