To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PAWS-X: A Cross-lingual Adversarial Dataset for Paraphrase Identification" by Yinfei Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a new dataset, PAWS-X, which consists of human-translated paraphrase identification pairs in multiple languages. This suggests that a dataset is indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **corpus creation procedure** sections. The authors describe the PAWS-X dataset in detail, stating that it includes 23,659 human-translated evaluation pairs across six languages (French, Spanish, German, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean). This confirms the dataset's existence and its purpose.I will also check the **experiments and results sections** to see if the authors provide any additional context or details about the dataset, such as its usage in their experiments. However, the primary focus is on the dataset's creation and characteristics.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the PAWS-X dataset. The authors reference the original PAWS dataset, which is crucial for understanding the context and citation of the new dataset. The citation for the original PAWS dataset is:> Yuan Zhang, Jason Baldridge, and Luheng He. *PAWS: Paraphrase Adversaries from Word Scrambling*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 1298a1308, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2019. Association for Computational Linguistics.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for PAWS-X, ensuring to include the full citation as it is essential for proper attribution. The dataset entry will include the dataset name, description, and citation.Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in the required format, ensuring that the citation is accurate and complete for the PAWS-X dataset.
