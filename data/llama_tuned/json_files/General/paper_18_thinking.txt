To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-label Categorization of Accounts of Sexism using a Neural Framework" by Pulkit Parikh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset construction sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a dataset for sexism categorization, which suggests that a specific dataset is being introduced.Next, I will focus on the **dataset construction section** where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that they collected 13,023 accounts of sexism from the **Everyday Sexism Project website**. This is a clear indication of the dataset's name and source.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the **Everyday Sexism Project website** as the source of the dataset, which is crucial for proper citation. The citation for the dataset is:> Pulkit Parikh, Harika Abburi, Pinkesh Badjatiya, Radhika Krishnan, Niyati Chhaya, Manish Gupta, and Vasudeva Varma. *Multi-label Categorization of Accounts of Sexism using a Neural Framework*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].Now, I will compile the dataset information, including the name, description, and citation, ensuring that I include all relevant details for clarity and completeness.In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:1. **Everyday Sexism Project Dataset**: This dataset consists of 13,023 accounts of sexism, including first-person accounts from survivors, each tagged with at least one of 23 categories of sexism. The categories were defined based on gender-related issues and campaigns.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry with the full citation for reference, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future use or analysis.
