To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural language understanding for task-oriented dialogue in the biomedical domain in a low resources context" by Antoine Neuraz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, data generation and augmentation, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a large EHR corpus for training a NLU model, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **data generation and augmentation section**. Here, the authors describe the creation of a training dataset using a tailored generator. They mention that they collected a set of 178 questions annotated manually as a gold standard, which indicates a dataset used for their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors refer to the generated training dataset and the real-world test data. They also mention using a large EHR corpus for training, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the EHR corpus. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the EHR corpus in the text, but I will look for any relevant references that might include it. However, the paper does not provide a formal citation for the EHR corpus, which is a common challenge in research papers.After reviewing the paper, I will summarize the datasets identified:1. **Generated Training Dataset**: This dataset consists of 178 questions annotated manually as a gold standard for NLU tasks. It is generated using templates and terminologies.2. **EHR Corpus**: The authors refer to a large EHR corpus used for training their models, but they do not provide a specific citation for it. Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the EHR corpus, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset used for their experiments.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the descriptions and any relevant citations where available. If the EHR corpus has a specific citation, I will include it; otherwise, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset without a formal citation.
