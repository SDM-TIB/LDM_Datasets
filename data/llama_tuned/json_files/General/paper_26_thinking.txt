To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Perspective Inferrer: Reasoning Sentences Relationship from Holistic Perspective" by Zhen Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the Multi-Perspective Inferrer (MPI) model and mentions experiments on two datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4.1), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two datasets:1. **SNLI Dataset**: This dataset consists of 570k sentence pairs, with the premise data sourced from the Flickr30k corpus and the hypothesis data manually composed. The training, development, and test datasets consist of 549,367/9,842/9,824 pairs of sentences.2. **MultiNLI Dataset**: This dataset contains 433k sentence pairs across nine genres, with a focus on matched and mismatched development/test sets. The authors specify that they use the official training and development sets for model selection.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For the **SNLI Dataset**, the citation is: > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In EMNLP, 2015.- For the **MultiNLI Dataset**, the citation is: > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel R. Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. In NAACL-HLT, 2018.Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
