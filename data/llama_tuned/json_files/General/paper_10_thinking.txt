To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Patent Landscaping Model Using the Transformer and Graph Embedding" by Seokkyu Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a model for patent landscaping and mention the use of benchmark datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges in patent landscaping and mention the need for benchmark datasets. They also refer to the construction of datasets based on the Korea Intellectual Property Strategy Agency (KISTA) patent trends reports, which is a strong indication that datasets are being created or referenced.In the **methods section**, the authors describe the datasets they built using Google BigQuery and the KISTA patent trends reports. They list four benchmark datasets specifically: MPUART, MWDFS, MRRG, and GOCS. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their research.I will then check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention that they measured the performance of their model on these datasets, which reinforces their importance in the study.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The authors reference the KISTA patent trends reports as the source of the datasets. The citation for the KISTA patent trends reports is:> Korea Intellectual Property Office (KIPO). *Patent trends reports*. Available at: https://www.kipo.go.kr/Next, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as identified. The datasets mentioned are:1. **MPUART**: A dataset based on the KISTA patent trends reports, containing 1,469,741 patents.2. **MWDFS**: A dataset based on the KISTA patent trends reports, containing 1,774,132 patents.3. **MRRG**: A dataset based on the KISTA patent trends reports, containing 2,068,566 patents.4. **GOCS**: A dataset based on the KISTA patent trends reports, containing 2,094,636 patents.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
