To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Insertion Transformer: Flexible Sequence Generation via Insertion Operations" by Mitchell Stern et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their approach on the **WMT 2014 English-German machine translation task**, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation process. They mention using the **WMT 2014 English-German translation dataset** for their experiments, specifically stating that they used the **newstest2013** for development and **newstest2014** for testing. This is a clear indication of the dataset used.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets, including the specific splits and the context in which they were used. They confirm that the WMT 2014 dataset is the primary dataset for their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WMT 2014 dataset. The citation is as follows:> WMT 2014 English-German Translation Dataset. Available at: https://www.wmt2014.org/translation-datasets.htmlThis citation provides the necessary information to describe the dataset accurately.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the details extracted from the paper, ensuring that I include the full citation for the WMT 2014 dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
