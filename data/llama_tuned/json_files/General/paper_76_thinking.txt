To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scheduled Sampling for Transformers" by Tsvetomila Mihaylova and AndrA e F. T. Martins, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of scheduled sampling in Transformer models, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments**. In this paper, the authors mention using the **IWSLT 2017 GermanaEnglish dataset** for their experiments. This is a significant dataset for machine translation tasks, and I will need to find its citation.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used, confirming that they utilized the IWSLT 2017 dataset for their experiments. Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citation for the IWSLT 2017 dataset. The citation is as follows:> Mauro Cettolo, Marcello Federico, Luisa Bentivogli, Niehues Jan, StA uker Sebastian, Sudoh Katsuitho, Yoshino Koichiro, and Federmann Christian. *Overview of the IWSLT 2017 evaluation campaign*. In International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, pages 2a14, 2017.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the IWSLT 2017 dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
