To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Eicient Attention Mechanism for Visual Dialog that can Handle All the Interactions between Multiple Inputs" by Van-Quang Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **VisDial datasets**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their evaluation.Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they used the **VisDial v1.0 dataset** for their experiments, which consists of dialogues with question-answer pairs and captions. This is a clear indication of the dataset's relevance.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the VisDial dataset. The citation is as follows:> Das, A., Kottur, S., Gupta, K., Singh, A., Yadav, D., Moura, J.M., Parikh, D., & Batra, D. (2017). Visual dialog. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 326a335).Now, I will compile the dataset entry for VisDial v1.0, ensuring to include the full citation as required. The dataset entry will include the dataset name, description, and citation.Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in the specified format for further processing or review. This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
