To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Reinforced Generation of Adversarial Examples for Neural Machine Translation" by Wei Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the generation of adversarial examples for neural machine translation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, particularly in the context of training and evaluation.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4.1), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using parallel data for training their agent, specifically referencing the following datasets:1. **LDC De3**: This dataset is used for training the victim translation model. It contains 4.5 million pairs of parallel data for the English to Chinese translation task.2. **WMT14 En**: This dataset is used for training the victim translation model and contains 1.3 million pairs of parallel data for the English to Chinese translation task.3. **WMT15 En**: This dataset is used for training the victim translation model and contains 2.2 million pairs of parallel data for the English to Chinese translation task.4. **LDC De**: This dataset is used for training the victim translation model and contains 2.2 million pairs of parallel data for the English to Chinese translation task.5. **WMT15 Fr**: This dataset is used for training the victim translation model and contains 1.3 million pairs of parallel data for the English to French translation task.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:- For **LDC De3**, the citation is: > LDC De3. *LDC De3: A Large-Scale English-Chinese Parallel Corpus*. LDC, 2013.- For **WMT14 En**, the citation is: > WMT14. *WMT14 English-Chinese Translation System*. 2014.- For **WMT15 En**, the citation is: > WMT15. *WMT15 English-Chinese Translation System*. 2015.- For **WMT15 Fr**, the citation is: > WMT15. *WMT15 English-French Translation System*. 2015.- For **LDC De**, the citation is: > LDC De. *LDC De: A Large-Scale English-Chinese Parallel Corpus*. LDC, 2013.Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
