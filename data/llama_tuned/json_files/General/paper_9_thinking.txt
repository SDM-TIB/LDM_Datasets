To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-modality Latent Interaction Network for Visual Question Answering" by Peng Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets, which suggests that I should look for specific names and details in these sections.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using **VQA v2.0** and **TDIUC** datasets. I will extract the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe VQA v2.0 as an updated version of VQA v1.0, which contains question-image pairs collected from the Microsoft COCO dataset. They also mention that TDIUC contains 1.6 million questions divided into 12 categories, which is a significant dataset for visual question answering.I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.The citations I will extract are:- For **VQA v2.0**, the citation is: > Yash Goyal, Tejas Khot, Douglas Summers-Stay, Dhruv Batra, and Devi Parikh. *Making the V in VQA matter: Elevating the role of image understanding in Visual Question Answering*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.- For **TDIUC**, the citation is: > Kushal Kaie and Christopher Kanan. *An analysis of visual question answering algorithms*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 1965a1973, 2017.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
