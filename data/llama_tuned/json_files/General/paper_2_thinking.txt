To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reverse, Retrieve, and Rank for Sarcasm Generation with Commonsense Knowledge" by Tuhin Chakrabarty et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of two existing datasets for testing the proposed method, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two datasets:1. **Multi-Genre NLI Dataset**: This dataset is used for training a model for natural language inference tasks. It is a broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference.2. **Sarcasm Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4,762 pairs of speakers' sarcastic messages and hearers' interpretations, collected through a crowdsourcing experiment.3. **Sarcasm Dataset (Mishra et al., 2019)**: This dataset contains 3,000 sarcastic tweets, each interpreted by five human judges, providing a novel task of sarcasm interpretation.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Multi-Genre NLI Dataset**, the citation is: > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1-10, 2018.- For the **Sarcasm Dataset**, the citation is: > Abhijit Mishra, Tarun Tater, and Karthik Sankaranarayanan. *A modular architecture for unsupervised sarcasm generation*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 6146a6155, 2019.- For the **Sarcasm Dataset (Mishra et al., 2019)**, the citation is the same as above since it is part of the same work.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
