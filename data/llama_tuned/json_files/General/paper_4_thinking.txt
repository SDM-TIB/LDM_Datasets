To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TMU Transformer System Using BERT for Re-ranking at BEA 2019 Grammatical Error Correction on Restricted Track" by Masahiro Kaneko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors are evaluating their system on the BEA 2019 shared task, which suggests that datasets related to this task will be discussed.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any tables or subsections that detail the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, including:1. **First Certificate in English (FCE) corpus**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation in the grammatical error correction task.2. **Lang-8 learner corpus**: Another dataset utilized for training and evaluation, specifically for the grammatical error correction task.3. **National University of Singapore Corpus of Learner English (NUCLE)**: This dataset is also referenced for training and evaluation purposes.4. **Write & Improve (W&I) + LOCNESS corpus**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the shared task evaluation.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For the **First Certificate in English (FCE) corpus**, the citation is: > Helen Yannakoudakis, Ted Briscoe, and Ben Medlock. *A New Dataset and Method for Automatically Grading ESOL Texts*. In NAACL, pages 180a189, Portland, Oregon, USA. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2011.- For the **Lang-8 learner corpus**, the citation is: > Tomoya Mizumoto, Mamoru Komachi, Masaaki Nagata, and Yuji Matsumoto. *Mining Revision Log of Language Learning SNS for Automated Japanese Error Correction of Second Language Learners*. In IJCNLP, pages 147a155, Chiguai, Thailand, 2011.- For the **National University of Singapore Corpus of Learner English (NUCLE)**, the citation is: > Daniel Dahlmeier, Hwee Tou Ng, and Siew Mei Wu. *Building a Large Annotated Corpus of Learner English: The NUS Corpus of Learner English*. In BEA, pages 22a31, Atlanta, Georgia. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2013.- For the **Write & Improve (W&I) + LOCNESS corpus**, the citation is: > Helen Yannakoudakis, Aistein E. Andersen, Ardeshir Geranpayeh, Ted Briscoe, and Diane Nicholls. *Developing an Automated Writing Placement System for ESL Learners*. Applied Measurement in Education 31:3, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
