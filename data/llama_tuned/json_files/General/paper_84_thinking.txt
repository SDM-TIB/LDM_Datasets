To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Local Neighboring Structure for Robust 3D Shape Representation" by Zhongpai Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two datasets, which suggests that specific names will be provided.Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that they evaluate their model on two datasets: **COMA** and **DFAUST**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the number of samples used.In the **evaluation section**, the authors describe COMA as a human facial dataset containing 20,466 3D meshes, and DFAUST as a human body dataset with over 40,000 real meshes. This information is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **COMA**, the citation is: > Ranjan, A., Bolkart, T., Sanyal, S., & Black, M. J. (2018). Generating 3D Faces using Convolutional Mesh Autoencoders. In The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).- For **DFAUST**, the citation is: > Bogo, F., Romero, J., Loper, M., & Black, M. J. (2017). Dynamic FAUST: Registering Human Bodies in Motion. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This structured approach will help in creating a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
