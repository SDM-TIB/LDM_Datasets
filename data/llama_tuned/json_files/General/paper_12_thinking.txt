To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Semantic Transformer Network with Retrieval Style Word Generator" by Hwanhee Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the AVSD task and mentions the use of datasets for evaluation, which indicates that datasets are present.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention two datasets: **DSTC7** and **DSTC8**. I will extract details about each dataset, including their purpose and any relevant characteristics mentioned in the paper.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide performance metrics for both datasets, which confirms their use in the study. They also reference the original papers for each dataset, which is crucial for obtaining full citations.Now, I will look at the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for the datasets:1. For **DSTC7**, the citation is: > Alamri, H., Cartillier, V., Lopes, R. G., Das, A., Wang, J., Essa, I., Batra, D., Parikh, D., Cherian, A., Marks, T. K., et al. (2018). Audio visual scene-aware dialog (AVSD) challenge at DSTC7. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.00525*.2. For **DSTC8**, the citation is: > Kim, S., Galley, M., Gunasekara, C., Lee, S., Atkinson, A., Peng, B., Schulz, H., Gao, J., Li, J., Adada, M., et al. (2019). The eighth dialog system technology challenge. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.06394*.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
