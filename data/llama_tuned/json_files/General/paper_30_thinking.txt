To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Latent Ontologies in Contextual Representations" by Julian Michael et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of latent subclass learning (LSL) and mentions various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 4) where the authors describe the tasks and datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using the **English Web Treebank part of Universal Dependencies 2.2** for dependency parsing and the **English portion of Ontonotes 5.0** for other tasks. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for the tasks, which further confirms the datasets' significance. I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. **English Web Treebank part of Universal Dependencies 2.2**: The citation is: > Silveira, N., Dozat, T., Marneffe, M.-C., Bowman, S., Connor, M., Bauer, J., & Manning, C. D. (2014). A gold standard in dependency parsing for English. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2014).2. **English portion of Ontonotes 5.0**: The citation is: > Weischedel, R., Palmer, M., Marcus, M., Hovy, E., Pradhan, S., Ramshaw, L., Xue, N., Taylor, A., Kaufman, J., Franchini, M., & Linguistic Data Consortium. (2013). Ontonotes 5.0. Linguistic Data Consortium.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
