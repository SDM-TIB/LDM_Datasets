To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distantly-Supervised Neural Relation Extraction with Side Information using BERT" by Johny Moreira et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **Google Distant Supervision (GDS) and Riedel datasets**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their evaluation.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used. They mention that they evaluated their method on the **Google Distant Supervision (GDS)** and **Riedel datasets**. This confirms that these datasets are indeed used in their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide statistics about the datasets, including the number of sentences and entity pairs for each. This information is important for understanding the datasets' characteristics.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **Google Distant Supervision (GDS)**, the citation is: > S. Jat, S. Khandelwal, and P. Talukdar. *Improving Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction using Word and Entity Based Attention*. http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.069872. For the **Riedel dataset**, the citation is: > S. Riedel, L. Yao, and A. McCallum. *Modeling Relations and Their Mentions without Labeled Text*. Proceedings of the 2010 European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases: Part III, pp. 148a163.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
