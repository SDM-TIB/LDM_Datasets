To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLaC Lab at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Contextual Emotion Detection Using a Combination of Neural Networks and SVM" by Elham Mohammadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper focuses on a dataset for contextual emotion detection, which suggests that a specific dataset is used.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors discuss the context of emotion detection and mention a dataset of 3-round dialogues, which is a strong indication that a dataset is involved.In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors describe their approach and the datasets they utilized, specifically mentioning that they used a dataset consisting of 3-round dialogues for their experiments. This indicates that the dataset is crucial to their research.I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional details about the dataset, such as its size or any specific characteristics that might be relevant for citation purposes.In the **references section**, I will locate the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to the dataset as part of the SemEval 2019 task, which is a shared task in the field of natural language processing. I will look for the citation related to this task to ensure I have the complete reference.The dataset is described as consisting of 3-round dialogues, but I need to find the specific citation for the dataset used in the context of the SemEval 2019 task. The relevant citation is:- For the **SemEval 2019 EmoContext task**, the citation is: > Ankush Chatterjee, Umang Gupta, Manoj Kumar Chinnakotla, Radhakrishnan Srikanth, Michel Galley, and Puneet Agrawal. *Understanding Emotions in Text Using Deep Learning and Big Data*. Computers in Human Behavior, 93:309a317, 2019.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
