To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-Tuning BERT for Text Classification" by Chi Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on eight widely-studied text classification datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention the following datasets:1. **IMDb Dataset**: Used for sentiment analysis.2. **Yelp Dataset**: Used for sentiment analysis.3. **TREC Dataset**: Used for question classification.4. **Yahoo! Answers Dataset**: Used for question classification.5. **Gas News Dataset**: Used for topic classification.6. **DBPedia Dataset**: Used for topic classification.7. **Sogou News Dataset**: Used for topic classification.8. **Yelp F Dataset**: Used for sentiment analysis.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:- For the **IMDb Dataset**, the citation is: > Andrew Maas, Raymond E Daly, Peter T Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies-volume 1, pages 142a150, 2011.- For the **Yelp Dataset**, the citation is: > Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 649a657, 2015.- For the **TREC Dataset**, the citation is: > Ellen M Voorhees and Dawn M Tice. *The TREC 8 question answering track evaluation*. In TREC, volume 1999, page 82, 1999.- For the **Yahoo! Answers Dataset**, the citation is: > Xiang Zhang, Dinghan Shen, Guoyin Wang, Zhe Gan, Ricardo Henao, and Lawrence Carin. *Deconvolutional paragraph representation learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 4169a4179, 2017.- For the **Gas News Dataset**, the citation is: > Xiang Zhang, Dinghan Shen, Guoyin Wang, Zhe Gan, Ricardo Henao, and Lawrence Carin. *Deconvolutional paragraph representation learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 4169a4179, 2017.- For the **DBPedia Dataset**, the citation is: > Xiang Zhang, Dinghan Shen, Guoyin Wang, Zhe Gan, Ricardo Henao, and Lawrence Carin. *Deconvolutional paragraph representation learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 4169a4179, 2017.- For the **Sogou News Dataset**, the citation is: > Xiang Zhang, Dinghan Shen, Guoyin Wang, Zhe Gan, Ricardo Henao, and Lawrence Carin. *Deconvolutional paragraph representation learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 4169a4179, 2017.- For the **Yelp F Dataset**, the citation is: > Xiang Zhang, Dinghan Shen, Guoyin Wang, Zhe Gan, Ricardo Henao, and Lawrence Carin. *Deconvolutional paragraph representation learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 4169a4179, 2017.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
