To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Segatron: Segment-Aware Transformer for Language Modeling and Understanding" by He Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on the **WikiText-103 dataset**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and results. They mention using the **WikiText-103 dataset** for language modeling tasks, confirming its significance in their research.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the **WikiText-103 dataset**, stating that it is a large word-level dataset with long-distance dependencies for language modeling, containing 103 million tokens and 28,000 articles for training. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **WikiText-103 dataset**. The citation is as follows:- For **WikiText-103**, the citation is: > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2017). Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 1-10). After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for **WikiText-103** into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
