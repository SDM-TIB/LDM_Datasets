To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HateMonitors: Language Agnostic Abuse Detection in Social Media" by Punyajoy Saha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a machine learning model for hate speech and offensive content detection, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **dataset section** (section 3) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention three languages: Hindi, English, and German, and describe the datasets for each language in terms of their statistics and tasks.In this section, the authors provide the following datasets:1. **HASOC Dataset**: This dataset is used for Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification in Indo-European Languages (HASOC). It includes datasets for Hindi, English, and German, with specific statistics for each language regarding the number of training and test samples for various subtasks.2. **German Dataset**: This dataset is part of the HASOC competition and is used for the German subtasks. It is noted that the German dataset is highly unbalanced, which may impact the performance of the model.3. **Hindi Dataset**: Similar to the German dataset, this is also part of the HASOC competition and is used for Hindi subtasks. The authors mention that the Hindi dataset is more balanced compared to the German dataset.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **HASOC Dataset**, the citation is: > Mandl, T., Modha, S., Patel, D., Dave, M., Mandlia, C., & Patel, A. (2019). Overview of the HASOC track at FIRE 2019: Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification in Indo-European Languages. In Proceedings of the 11th annual meeting of the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (December 2019).- For the **German Dataset**, the citation is: > Wiegand, M., Siegel, M., & Ruppenhofer, J. (2018). Overview of the GermEval 2018 shared task on the identification of offensive language. In Proceedings of the 14th Conference on Natural Language Processing (KONVENS 2018).- For the **Hindi Dataset**, the citation is the same as the HASOC Dataset since it is part of the same competition.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
