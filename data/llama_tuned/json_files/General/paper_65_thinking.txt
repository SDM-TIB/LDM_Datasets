To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LXMERT: Learning Cross-Modality Encoder Representations from Transformers" by Hao Tan and Mohit Bansal, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on two visual question answering datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 4.1) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they list three datasets:1. **VQA v2.0**: This dataset is used for visual question answering and contains an average of 5.4 questions per image, totaling 1.1 million questions.2. **GQA**: This dataset is similar to VQA but requires more reasoning skills, with 22 million questions generated from ground truth image scene graphs.3. **NLVR2**: This dataset is a challenging visual reasoning dataset where sentences and images are paired, with a total of 86,000, 7,000, and 7,000 data points in the training, development, and test sets, respectively.In the **appendix**, the authors provide more details about each dataset, confirming their usage in the experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For **VQA v2.0**, the citation is: > Yash Goyal, Tejas Khot, Douglas Summers-Stay, Dhruv Batra, and Devi Parikh. *Making the V in VQA matter: Elevating the role of image understanding in visual question answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 6904a6913, 2017.- For **GQA**, the citation is: > Drew A Hudson and Christopher D Manning. *GQA: A new dataset for compositional question answering over real-world images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2019.- For **NLVR2**, the citation is: > Alane Suhr, Stephanie Zhou, Iris Zhang, Huajun Bai, and Yoav Artzi. *A corpus for reasoning about natural language grounded in photographs*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
