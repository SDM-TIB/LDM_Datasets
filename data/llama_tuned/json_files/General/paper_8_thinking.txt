To extract datasets from the research paper titled "XQA: A Cross-lingual Open-domain Question Answering Dataset" by Jiahua Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a novel dataset for cross-lingual OpenQA, which suggests that a specific dataset will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the need for a dataset for cross-lingual OpenQA and hint at the creation of a new dataset. This suggests that the dataset is central to their research.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the dataset in detail, stating that it consists of a training set in English and development and test sets in eight other languages. They provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of question-answer pairs and the languages involved. This confirms that the dataset is a key component of their research.I will also check the **data collection section** to see if the authors provide any additional details about the dataset, such as how it was constructed or the sources used for data collection. The paper mentions using Wikipedia and WikiData as sources for the questions and answers, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's origin.Now, I will look for the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference Wikipedia and WikiData as sources, but they do not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself. However, I will note that the dataset is publicly available at a specific GitHub repository, which is a common practice in the field.The citation for the dataset will be formatted as follows:- For the **XQA dataset**, the citation is: > Jiahua Liu, Yankai Lin, Zhiyuan Liu, and Maosong Sun. *XQA: A Cross-lingual Open-domain Question Answering Dataset*. Available at: https://github.com/thunlp/XQA.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation and a clear description of the dataset's purpose and characteristics. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
