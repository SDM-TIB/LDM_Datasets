To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Grammatical Error Detection with Contextual Word Representations" by Samuel Bella et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of contextualized word representations for grammatical error detection, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **data section** (section 3), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, I will look for any tables or lists that detail the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their structure or content.In this section, the authors mention the following datasets:1. **The First Certificate in English (FCE) dataset**: This dataset consists of essays written by non-native learners of English, annotated with language errors and suggested corrections.2. **CoNLL 2014 shared task on GEC**: This dataset includes essays written by advanced undergraduate students, also annotated with errors and corrections.3. **Johns Hopkins University (JHU) FLuency-Extended GUG Corpus**: This dataset contains essays written by a range of English learners, with corrections provided by native-level annotators.4. **Cambridge English Write & Improve (W&I) corpus**: This dataset is a collection of texts written by learners of varying proficiency levels, used for assessing writing feedback.5. **LOCNESS corpus**: This dataset consists of essays written by native English students, annotated for corrections.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:- For **FCE**, the citation is: > Helen Yannakoudakis, Aistein E Andersen, Ardeshir Geranpayeh, Ted Briscoe, and Diane Nicholls. *A new dataset and method for automatically grading ESOL texts*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 180a189, 2011.- For **CoNLL 2014**, the citation is: > Hwee Tou Ng, Siew Mei Wu, Ted Briscoe, Christian Hadiwinoto, Raymond Hendy Susanto, and Christopher Bryant. *The CoNLL-2014 shared task on grammatical error correction*. In Proceedings of the Eighteenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning: Shared Task, pages 1a14, 2014.- For **JHU FLUENCY-EXTENDED GUG Corpus**, the citation is: > Courtney Napoles, Keisuke Sakaguchi, and Joel Tetreault. *JFLEG: A fluency corpus and benchmark for grammatical error correction*. In Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 229a234, 2017.- For **Cambridge English Write & Improve (W&I) corpus**, the citation is: > Helen Yannakoudakis, Ted Briscoe, and Ben Medlock. *Developing an automated writing placement system for ESL learners*. Applied Measurement in Education, 31(3):251a267, 2018.- For **LOCNESS corpus**, the citation is: > Sylviane Granger. *The computer learner corpus: A versatile new source of data for SLA research*. In Learner English on Computer, pages 3a18, 1998.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
