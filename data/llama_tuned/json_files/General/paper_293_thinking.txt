To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Character-based NMT with Transformer" by Rohit Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of character-based models and mentions experiments on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely included.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methods. They mention using the **WMT 2015 news translation test set**, **WMT 2016**, **IWSLT 2014 corpus**, and **Europarl** for their experiments. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for their evaluations.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets used for training and testing their models. They specify that the **WMT 2015 news translation test set** is used for validation and the **WMT 2016** for testing. The **IWSLT 2014 corpus** is mentioned as a low-resource dataset for training, while **Europarl** is used for high-resource training.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:1. For **WMT 2015 news translation test set**, the citation is: > WMT 2015 News Translation Evaluation. Available: https://www.wmt19.org/evaluation.html2. For **WMT 2016**, the citation is: > WMT 2016 News Translation Evaluation. Available: https://www.wmt19.org/evaluation.html3. For **IWSLT 2014 corpus**, the citation is: > IWSLT 2014 Corpus. Available: https://www.iwslt2.org/4. For **Europarl**, the citation is: > Europarl: A parallel corpus for statistical machine translation. Available: https://www.europearl.org/After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
