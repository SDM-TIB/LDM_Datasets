To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bilingual is At Least Monolingual (BALM): A Novel Translation Algorithm that Encodes Monolingual Priors" by Jeffrey Cheng and Chris Callison-Burch, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of a novel translation algorithm and mentions a dataset, which indicates that a specific dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled "Data source." Here, the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments: **Multi30k**. They describe it as a multilingual extension of the Flickr30k image-captioning dataset, which contains English-language captions and human-generated German-language captions for each image.In the **results section**, the authors confirm the use of the Multi30k dataset for their experiments, which reinforces its significance in their research.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Multi30k dataset. The citation is as follows:> Desmond Elliott, Stella Frank, Khalil Simaaan, and Lucia Specia. *Multi30k: Multilingual English-German Image Descriptions*. CoRR, abs/1605.00459, 2016.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details from the paper.
