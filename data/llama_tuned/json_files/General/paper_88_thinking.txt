To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Captioning through Image Transformer" by Sen He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of a new architecture for image captioning, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention using the **MSCOCO image captioning dataset** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that this dataset is central to their research.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MSCOCO dataset. The citation is as follows:> Chen, X., Fang, H., Lin, T.Y., Vedantam, R., Gupta, S., Doll√°r, P., & Zitnick, C.L. (2015). Microsoft coco captions: Data collection and evaluation server. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00325.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:1. **MSCOCO Image Captioning Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluating image captioning models. It contains 11,328 images with 5,000 images in the test set, each annotated with 5 captions as ground truth.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and citation from the paper.
