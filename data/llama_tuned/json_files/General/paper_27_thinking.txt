To extract datasets from the research paper titled "E-BERT: Efficient-Yet-Effective Entity Embeddings for BERT" by Nina Poernemann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the E-BERT model on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **evaluation sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the use of the **LAMA dataset** for evaluating their model, which indicates that this is a key dataset for their research.In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They mention two specific datasets:1. **LAMA Dataset**: This dataset is used for unsupervised question answering (QA) and is referenced multiple times throughout the paper. The authors describe its structure and the heuristics applied to it.2. **AIDA Dataset**: This dataset is used for entity linking and is also mentioned in the context of their experiments.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:- For the **LAMA Dataset**, the citation is: > Fabio Petroni, Tim RocktAaschel, Patrick Lewis, Anton Bakhtin, Yuxiang Wu, Alexander H Miller, and Sebastian Riedel. *Language models as knowledge bases?* In EMNLP-IJCNLP, pages 1-8, 2019.- For the **AIDA Dataset**, the citation is: > Johannes Hoffart, Mohamed Amir Yosef, Ilaria Bordino, Hagen Faurstenau, Manfred Pinkal, Marc Spaniel, Bilyana Taneva, Stefan Thater, and Gerhard Weikum. *Robust disambiguation of named entities in text*. In EMNLP, pages 782a792, 2011.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
