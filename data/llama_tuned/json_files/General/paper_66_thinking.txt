To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Generalized Framework of Sequence Generation with Application to Undirected Sequence Models" by Elman Mansimov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed framework to undirected sequence models, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **experimental settings section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **WMTa14 English-German translation dataset**, which consists of 4.5 million parallel sentence pairs. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for this dataset. The citation for the WMTa14 dataset is:- For **WMTa14 English-German translation dataset**, the citation is: > Lample, G., & Conneau, A. (2019). Cross-lingual language model pretraining. arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.07291.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and citation from the paper.
