To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrating Multimodal Information in Large Pretrained Transformers" by Wasifur Rahman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their research.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments:1. **CMU-MOSI**: This dataset is described as containing 2199 video segments from 93 YouTube movie review videos, with real-valued high-agreement sentiment intensity annotations.2. **CMU-MOSEI**: This dataset is mentioned as containing sentiment annotations at the sentence level, which is different from CMU-MOSI.Both datasets are used for multimodal sentiment analysis, and the authors provide details about the data collection process and the modalities involved.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For **CMU-MOSI**, the citation is: > Amir Zadeh, Minghai Chen, Soujanya Poria, Erik Cambria, and Louis-Philippe Morency. *CMU-MOSI: Multimodal Opinion Sentiment Intensity*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), volume 1, pages 2236a2246, 2016.- For **CMU-MOSEI**, the citation is: > Amir Zadeh, Paul Pu Liang, Navonil Mazumder, Soujanya Poria, Erik Cambria, and Louis-Philippe Morency. *Multimodal Language Analysis in the Wild: CMU-MOSEI Dataset and Interpretable Dynamic Fusion Graph*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), volume 1, pages 2236a2246, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
