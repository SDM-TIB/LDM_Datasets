To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structured Pruning of BERT-based Question Answering Models" by J.S. McCarley and Rishav Chakravarti and Avirup Sil, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the pruning of BERT-based models for question answering, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of question answering tasks.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they state that they evaluate their method on two benchmark QA datasets: **SQuAD 2.0** and **Natural Questions (NQ)**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **SQuAD 2.0**, the citation is: > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jacob Devlin, Ernie Graham, and Percy Liang. *Know what you donâ€™t know: Unanswerable questions for SQuAD*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers), pages 784a789, Melbourne, Australia, 2018.- For **Natural Questions (NQ)**, the citation is: > Tom Kwiatkowski, Jennimaria Palomaki, Olivia Redfield, Michael Collins, Ankur Parikh, Chris Alberti, Danielle Epstein, Illia Polosukhin, Matthew Kelcey, Jacob Devlin, Kenton Lee, Kristina N. Toutanova, Lion Jones, Ming-Wei Chang, Andrew Dai, Jakob Uszkoreit, Quoc Le, and Slav Petrov. *Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
