To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HLT@SUDA at SemEval 2019 Task 1: UCCA Graph Parsing as Constituent Tree Parsing" by Wei Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a semantic graph parsing approach, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **introduction** to see if the authors provide any dataset references.Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this paper, the authors mention using datasets for training and evaluation, specifically in the context of UCCA parsing. They refer to the **English-Wiki data** and **English-20K data** for their experiments. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their work.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following datasets:- For **English-Wiki data**, the citation is: > Daniel Hershcovich, Omri Abend, and Ari Rappoport. *Semeval 2019 task 1: Cross-lingual semantic parsing with UCCA*. arXiv:1903.02953, 2019.- For **English-20K data**, the citation is: > Daniel Hershcovich, Omri Abend, and Ari Rappoport. *Semeval 2019 task 1: Cross-lingual semantic parsing with UCCA*. arXiv:1903.02953, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
