To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combating Adversarial Misspellings with Robust Word Recognition" by Danish Pruthi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of word recognition models and mentions evaluating spell correctors, which suggests that datasets related to text data may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors describe their evaluation methods. Here, they mention using the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)** for evaluating spell correctors and the **IMDB movie reviews** as a background corpus. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets used:1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: This dataset consists of 8,544 movie reviews, with a vocabulary of over 16,000 words. It is used for evaluating spell correctors.2. **IMDB movie reviews**: This dataset contains 54,000 movie reviews, with a vocabulary of over 78,000 words. It serves as a background corpus for their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**, the citation is: > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2013.- For the **IMDB movie reviews**, the citation is: > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2011.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
