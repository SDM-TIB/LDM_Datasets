To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DIET: Lightweight Language Understanding for Dialogue Systems" by Tanja Bunk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** (section 4.1), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:1. **NLU-Benchmark**: This dataset is described as being annotated with scenarios, actions, and entities, containing 25,716 utterances across multiple home assistant tasks. The authors provide details about the dataset's structure and the number of intents and entity types.2. **ATIS**: This dataset consists of annotated transcripts of audio recordings of people making flight reservations, with a total of 4,478,500 training utterances and 893 test utterances.3. **SNIPS**: This dataset is collected from the Snips personal voice assistant and contains 13,784 training examples and 700 test examples.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **NLU-Benchmark**, the citation is: > Bing Liu and Ian Lane. *Benchmarking natural language understanding services for building conversational agents*. CoRR, abs/1903.05566, 2019.- For **ATIS**, the citation is: > Charles T. Hemphill, John J. Godfrey, and George R. Doddington. *The ATIS spoken language systems pilot corpus*. In Speech and Natural Language: Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Hidden Valley, Pennsylvania, June 24-27, 1990.- For **SNIPS**, the citation is: > Alice Coucke, Alaa Saade, Adrien Ball, Théodore Bluche, Alexandre Caulier, David Leroy, Clément Joint BERT sparse + ConveRT as sparse + GloVe as sparse + ATISIntent Entities96.1097.9095.0896.5994.9996.3195.3796.61Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
