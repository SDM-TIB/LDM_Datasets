To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Global Entity Disambiguation with BERT" by Ikuya Yamada et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model using a large entity-annotated corpus from Wikipedia, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any datasets used for evaluation. They refer to achieving state-of-the-art results on several standard ED datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are likely included.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:1. **AIDA-CoNLL**: A dataset for named entity disambiguation.2. **MSNBC**: A dataset for news articles used for entity disambiguation.3. **AQUAINT**: A dataset for entity disambiguation in news articles.4. **ACE2004**: A dataset for named entity disambiguation in news articles.5. **WNED-WIKI**: A dataset for entity disambiguation using Wikipedia.6. **WNED-CWEB**: A dataset for entity disambiguation using web pages.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **AIDA-CoNLL**, the citation is: > Johannes Hoffart, Mohamed Amir Yosef, Ilaria Bordino, Hagen FÃ¤rstenau, Manfred Pinkal, Marc Spaniol, Bilyana Taneva, Stefan Thater, and Gerhard Weikum. *Robust Disambiguation of Named Entities in Text*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 782a792, 2011.- For **MSNBC**, the citation is: > Jeffrey Ling, Nicholas FitzGerald, Zifei Shan, Livio Baldini Soares, Thibault FAvry, David Weiss, and Tom Kwiatkowski. *Learning Cross-Context Entity Representations from Text*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.03765v1, 2020.- For **AQUAINT**, the citation is: > Jeffrey Ling, Nicholas FitzGerald, Zifei Shan, Livio Baldini Soares, Thibault FAvry, David Weiss, and Tom Kwiatkowski. *Learning Cross-Context Entity Representations from Text*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.03765v1, 2020.- For **ACE2004**, the citation is: > Jeffrey Ling, Nicholas FitzGerald, Zifei Shan, Livio Baldini Soares, Thibault FAvry, David Weiss, and Tom Kwiatkowski. *Learning Cross-Context Entity Representations from Text*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.03765v1, 2020.- For **WNED-WIKI**, the citation is: > Zhaochen Guo and Denilson Barbosa. *Robust Named Entity Disambiguation with Random Walks*. Semantic Web, 9(4):459a479, 2018.- For **WNED-CWEB**, the citation is: > Zhaochen Guo and Denilson Barbosa. *Robust Named Entity Disambiguation with Random Walks*. Semantic Web, 9(4):459a479, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
