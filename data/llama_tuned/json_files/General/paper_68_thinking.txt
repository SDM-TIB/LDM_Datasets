To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enriching the Transformer with Linguistic Factors for Low-Resource Machine Translation" by Jordi Armengol-Estap et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental framework sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of linguistic factors in machine translation, which suggests that datasets related to translation tasks may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental framework section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention two specific datasets:1. **IWSLT14**: This dataset is a low-resource dataset for German-to-English translation, containing approximately 160,000 sentences. The authors specify that they used the test sets from this dataset for their experiments.2. **FLoRes**: This dataset is designed for low-resource machine translation, specifically for the English-to-Nepali translation task, containing 564,000 parallel sentences. The authors mention that they used this dataset to evaluate their proposed model.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For **IWSLT14**, the citation is: > Mauro Cettolo, Jan Niehues, Sebastian Stüker, Luisa Bentivogli, and Marcello Federico. *Report on the 11th IWSLT evaluation campaign*. In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, Hanoi, Vietnam, page 57, 2014.- For **FLoRes**, the citation is: > Francisco Guzmán, Peng-Jen Chen, Myle Ott, Juan Pino, Guillaume Lample, Philipp Koehn, Vishrav Chaudhary, and Marca Aurelio Ranzato. *Two new evaluation datasets for low-resource machine translation: Nepali-English and Sinhala-English*. CoRR, abs/1902.01382, 2019.Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
