To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting BERT for End-to-End Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis" by Xin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two review datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they state that they conducted experiments on two review datasets originating from SemEval, specifically mentioning the **LAPTOP and REST datasets**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their research.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are as follows:- For the **LAPTOP dataset**, the citation is: > Pontiki, M., Galanis, D., Papageorgiou, H., Androutsopoulos, I., Manandhar, S., AL-Smadi, M., Al-Ayyoub, M., Zhao, Y., Qin, B., De Clercq, O., Hoste, V., Apidianaki, M., Tannier, X., Loukachevitch, N., Kotelnikov, E., Bel, N., Jimenez-Zafra, S., and Eryi, G. *SemEval-2016 task 5: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In SemEval, pages 19a30, 2016.- For the **REST dataset**, the citation is: > Pontiki, M., Galanis, D., Pavlopoulos, J., Androutsopoulos, I., Papageorgiou, H., Manandhar, S., and Androutsopoulos, I. *SemEval-2015 task 12: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In SemEval, pages 486a495, 2015.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
