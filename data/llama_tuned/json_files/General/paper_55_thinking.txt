To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BERT for Evidence Retrieval and Claim Verification" by Amir Soleimani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of BERT for evidence retrieval and claim verification in the FEVER challenge, which suggests that a dataset related to this challenge is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the FEVER dataset. They describe it as a benchmark for evidence-based claim verification, consisting of 185K generated claims labeled as SUPPORTED, REFUTED, or NOT ENOUGH INFO. This indicates that the FEVER dataset is a primary dataset used in their research.In the **methods section**, the authors provide more details about the FEVER dataset, confirming its structure and the tasks it supports. They mention that the dataset covers a wide range of topics and that pre-trained models are useful for overcoming data limitations.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the FEVER dataset. The relevant citation is:- For the **FEVER dataset**, the citation is: > James Thorne, Andreas Vlachos, Christos Christodoulopoulos, and Arpit Mittal. *FEVER: a large-scale dataset for fact extraction and verification*. CoRR, abs/1803.05355, 2018.Since the FEVER dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.In summary, I will create an entry for the FEVER dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
