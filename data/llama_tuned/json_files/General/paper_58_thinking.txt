To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Warm-up and Self-Training: Training Strategies of NICT-2 NMT System at WAT-2019" by Kenji Imamura and Eiichiro Sumita, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the NICT-2 NMT system, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **introduction** where the authors discuss the system's characteristics and the tasks it participated in. They mention participating in three tasks: ASPEC.en-ja, ASPEC.ja-en, and TDDC.ja-en, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **corpus sizes section** (Table 1) to find specific dataset names. The authors list the sizes of the corpora used for the ASPEC tasks and the TDDC task, which indicates that these are the datasets I need to extract.In the **corpus sizes section**, I find the following datasets:1. **Asian Scientific Paper Excerpt Corpus (ASPEC)**: This dataset is used for the ASPEC tasks, and it is described as a collection of scientific papers.2. **Timely Disclosure Documents Corpus (TDDC)**: This dataset is used for the TDDC task, and it is noted that the development and test sets are divided into items and texts sets.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **Asian Scientific Paper Excerpt Corpus (ASPEC)**, the citation is: > Toshiaki Nakazawa, Chenchen Ding, Raj Dabre, Hideya Mino, Isao Goto, Win Pa Pa, Nobushige Doi, Yusuke Oda, Anoop Kunchukuttan, Shantripriya Parida, Ondrej Bojar, and Sadao Kurohashi. *Overview of the 6th workshop on Asian translation*. In Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Asian Translation, pages 2204a2208, Portorož, Slovenia, 2016.- For **Timely Disclosure Documents Corpus (TDDC)**, the citation is: > Toshiaki Nakazawa, Manabu Yaguchi, Kiyotaka Uchiimoto, Masao Utiyama, Eiichiro Sumita, Sadao Kurohashi, and Hitoshi Isahara. *ASPEC: In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016)*, pages 2204a2208, Portorož, Slovenia, 2016.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
