To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Insertion-Deletion Transformer" by Laura Ruisa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the Insertion-Deletion Transformer on synthetic translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention two synthetic translation tasks:1. **Alphabetic Sequence Shifting**: The authors describe how they generate sequences by shifting alphabetic sequences, specifying that they generated 1000 examples for training and evaluated on 100 held-out examples.2. **Caesaras Cipher**: This task involves encrypting sequences using the Caesar cipher, and they mention generating 100k examples for training and evaluating on 1000 held-out examples.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are synthetic and not publicly available, I will note that they are generated for the purpose of the experiments and do not have formal citations like traditional datasets.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the details about the synthetic nature of these datasets and the context in which they were used in the experiments. This will provide a clear understanding of the datasets referenced in the paper, even if they do not have formal citations.
