To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentiment Classification" by Giuseppe Attardi and Daniele Sartiano, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of word embeddings created from a collection of 50 million tweets, which indicates that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the use of a corpus of news articles for creating word embeddings. This suggests that there is a specific dataset related to sentiment analysis in Twitter.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **SemEval 2013 task 10** and **SemEval 2016** datasets for training and evaluation. They also mention using a corpus of tweets for training embeddings, which is another dataset.I will also check the **results section** to confirm the datasets used for evaluation and any additional datasets referenced. The authors mention using a corpus of 35 million tweets for further experiments, which is another dataset.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **SemEval 2013 task 10**, the citation is: > Sara Rosenthal, Preslav Nakov, Svetlana Kiritchenko, Saif Mohammad, Alan Ritter, and Veselin Stoyanov. *SemEval-2015 Task 10: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter*. Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2015), 2015.2. For the **SemEval 2016**, the citation is: > Preslav Nakov, Alan Ritter, Sara Rosenthal, Fabrizio Sebastiani, and Veselin Stoyanov. *SemEval-2016 Task 3: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter*. Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2016), 2016.3. For the **corpus of tweets**, the citation is: > Tomas Mikolov, Ilya Sutskever, Kai Chen, Greg S. Corrado, and Jeff Dean. *Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionalality*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 26, pages 3111a3119, 2013.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
