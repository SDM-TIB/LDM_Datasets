To extract datasets from the research paper titled "POS Tagging For Resource Poor Indian Languages Through Feature Projection" by Pruthwik Mishra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of feature transfer for POS tagging across resource-poor Indian languages, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **corpus details section** (section 3) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:1. **ILCI (Indian Languages Corpora Initiative) parallel corpora**: This dataset is used for POS tagging across multiple Indian languages, including Punjabi, Konkani, Bengali, Telugu, Malayalam, Urdu, Marathi, and Gujarati. The authors provide details about the number of sentences and tokens in the dataset.2. **Hindi Treebank**: This dataset is a multi-layered representation of sentences with syntactic and semantic annotations, specifically annotated with POS tags. The authors mention the number of sentences and tokens in the Hindi Treebank.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **ILCI**, the citation is: > Narayan Choudhary and Girish Nath Jha. *Creating multilingual parallel corpora in Indian languages*. In Human Language Technology Challenges for Computer Science and Linguistics, pages 527a537. Springer, 2014.- For **Hindi Treebank**, the citation is: > Akshar Bharati, Rajeev Sangal, and Dipti M Sharma. *Ssf: Shakti standard format guide*. Language Technologies Research Centre, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India, pages 1a25.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
