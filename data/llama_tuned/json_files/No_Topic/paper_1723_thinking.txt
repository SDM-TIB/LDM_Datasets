To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discourse Sense Classification from Scratch using Focused RNNs" by Gregor Weiss and Marko Bajec, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **evaluation sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges in discourse parsing and mention the use of existing resources and datasets. This suggests that datasets are crucial for their experiments.In the **evaluation section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:1. **English Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB)**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation in the context of discourse parsing.2. **Chinese Discourse TreeBank (CDTB)**: Similar to PDTB, this dataset is utilized for the same purpose in the Chinese language.3. **English Blind Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method, specifically for the English language.4. **Chinese Blind Dataset**: Another dataset used for evaluation, this one in the Chinese language.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:- For **PDTB**, the citation is: > Rashmi Prasad, Nikhil Dinesh, Alan Lee, Eleni Mitsakaki, Livio Robaldo, Aravind Joshi, and Bonnie Webber. *The Penn Discourse TreeBank 2.0*. Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, pages 2961a2968, 2008.- For **CDTB**, the citation is: > Yuping Zhou and Nianwen Xue. *PDTB-style Discourse Annotation of Chinese Text*. Proceedings of the 50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 69a77, 2012.- For the **English Blind Dataset**, the citation is: > Martin Potthast, Tim Gollub, Francisco Rangel, Paolo Rosso, Efstathios Stamatatos, and Benno Stein. *Improving the Reproducibility of PANas2014 Shared Tasks: Plagiarism Detection, Author Identification, and Author Profiling*. In Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 268a299, 2014.- For the **Chinese Blind Dataset**, the citation is: > Martin Potthast, Tim Gollub, Francisco Rangel, Paolo Rosso, Efstathios Stamatatos, and Benno Stein. *Improving the Reproducibility of PANas2014 Shared Tasks: Plagiarism Detection, Author Identification, and Author Profiling*. In Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 268a299, 2014.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
