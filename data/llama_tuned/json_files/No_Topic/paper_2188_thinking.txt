To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporally-Informed Analysis of Named Entity Recognition" by Shruti Rijhwani and Daniel PreotA iuc-Pietro, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce a new dataset of English tweets annotated with named entities, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **temporal Twitter Data Set section**. Here, the authors describe the dataset in detail, stating that it consists of 12,000 English tweets collected over six years, annotated with named entities. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including its purpose and the annotation process.In the **temporal Twitter Data Set section**, the authors provide additional context about the dataset, including the collection strategy and the annotation methodology. They mention that the dataset is designed to address the lack of temporal diversity in existing Twitter datasets, which is crucial for their analysis.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the **Broad Twitter Corpus** as a previous work that contains tweets collected over several years, which is relevant to their dataset. The citation for the Broad Twitter Corpus is:> Leon Derczynski, Kalina Bontcheva, and Ian Roberts. *Broad Twitter Corpus: A diverse named entity recognition resource*. In Proceedings of COLING 2016, pages 1169a1179, Osaka, Japan, 2016.Since the authors created their own dataset, I will also look for the citation related to their dataset. The authors mention that their dataset is available at a GitHub repository, which is a common practice for datasets. The citation for their dataset is:> Shruti Rijhwani and Daniel PreotA iuc-Pietro. *Temporal Twitter Corpus*. Available at: https://github.com/shrutirij/temporal-twitter-corpus.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both the Broad Twitter Corpus and the dataset introduced by the authors. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in their research.
