To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Large-Scale Dataset for Empathetic Response Generation" by Anuradha Welivita, Yubo Xie, and Pearl Pu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a large-scale dataset for empathetic response generation, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any existing datasets that they are building upon or comparing against. The introduction discusses the need for large-scale datasets in the field of empathetic response generation, but it does not specify any datasets yet.In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the creation of their dataset, EDOS, which is a novel large-scale dataset consisting of 1M dialogues annotated with 32 fine-grained emotions and eight empathetic response intents. This is a key dataset that I need to document.I will also look for any references to existing datasets in the **literature review** or **results section** to ensure I have the full citation for EDOS. The authors mention several existing datasets in the literature, such as IEMOCAP, MELD, DailyDialogue, EmotionLines, and EmoContext, which are relevant for comparison and context.The **results section** provides additional details about EDOS, confirming its size and the types of annotations it contains. The authors also mention that they evaluated EDOS against the EmpatheticDialogues dataset, which is another dataset used for comparison.Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations I will use are as follows:- For **EDOS**, the citation is: > Anuradha Welivita, Yubo Xie, and Pearl Pu. *A Large-Scale Dataset for Empathetic Response Generation*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1251a1264, 2021.- For **EmpatheticDialogues**, the citation is: > Hannah Rashkin, Eric Michael Smith, Margaret Li, and Y-Lan Boureau. *Towards empathetic open-domain conversation models: A new benchmark and dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.00207, 2018.- For **IEMOCAP**, the citation is: > Carlos Busso, Murtaza Bulut, Chi-Chun Lee, Abe Kazemzadeh, Emily Mower, Samuel Kim, Jeanette N Chang, Sungbok Lee, and Shrikanth S. I. EmoCAP: Interactive emotional language resources and evaluation, 42(4):335, 2008.- For **MELD**, the citation is: > Soujanya Poria, Devamanyu Hazarika, Navonil Majumder, Gautam Naik, Erik Cambria, and Rada Mihalcea. *MELD: A multimodal multi-party dataset for emotion recognition in conversations*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 527a536, 2019.- For **DailyDialogue**, the citation is: > Jiwei Li, Michel Galley, Chris Brockett, Jianfeng Gao, and Bill Dolan. *DailyDialogue: A manually labelled multi-turn dialogue dataset*. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 986a995, 2017.- For **EmotionLines**, the citation is: > Chao-Chun Hsu, Sheng-Yeh Chen, Chuan-Chun Kuo, Ting-Hao Huang, and Lun-Wei Ku. *EmotionLines: An emotion corpus of multi-party conversations*. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018), Miyazaki, Japan, 2018.- For **EmoContext**, the citation is: > Ankush Chatterjee, Umang Gupta, Manoj Kumar Chinna, Radhakrishnan Srikanth, Michel Galley, and Puneet Agrawal. *Understanding emotions in text using deep learning and big data*. Computers in Human Behavior, 93:309a317, 2019.After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
