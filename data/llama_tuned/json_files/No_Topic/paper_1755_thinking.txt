To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A multi-Teraiop Constituency Parser using GPUs" by John Canny and Dan Hall, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the development of a constituency parser using GPUs, which suggests that datasets related to parsing or grammar may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their parser. In this section, they mention using the **Penn Treebank test set** for parsing performance evaluation. This indicates that the Penn Treebank is a dataset relevant to their work.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Penn Treebank. The citation is as follows:> Mitchell P. Marcus, Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313a330, 1993.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its reference from the paper.
