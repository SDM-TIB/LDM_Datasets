To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Micro blogs Oriented Word Segmentation System" by Yijia Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of word segmentation on micro blogs and mentions the use of annotated micro blogs and the People Daily corpus, indicating that these are datasets used in the study.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their data preparation process. They mention that they crawled micro blogs from September 1st, 2011, to September 5th, 2011, and used 1 million entries as unlabeled data. They also mention that they randomly sampled 1,442 annotated micro blogs, which is a significant dataset for their experiments.In the **data preparation subsection**, the authors specify that they used the annotated micro blogs and the People Daily corpus as labeled data. This confirms that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **annotated micro blogs**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is implied that it is a custom dataset created for this study. However, I will note that it is derived from micro blogs crawled during the experiment.2. For the **People Daily corpus**, the citation is: > Wang, Y., Junaichi, Y. T., Kazama, W., Chen, W., Zhang, Y., & Torisawa, K. (2011). Improving Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging with semi-supervised methods using large auto-analyzed data. In Proceedings of the Fifth International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP-2011).3. I will compile the dataset entries, noting that the annotated micro blogs are a custom dataset and the People Daily corpus is a well-known dataset in the field.After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
