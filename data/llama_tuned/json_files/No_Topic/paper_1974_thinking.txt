To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BERT + Ensembling = Too Cool: Using Multiple BERT Models Together for Various COVID-19 Tweet Identification Tasks" by Leung Wai Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the tasks and the competition context, which may hint at the datasets used.Next, I will focus on the **datasets section** (section 2) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their tasks. Here, they describe two datasets:1. **DeepADEMiner Dataset**: This dataset is used for the pharmacovigilance task, specifically for ADE (Adverse Event of a drug) classification. The authors reference the original paper by Arjun Magge et al. (2021b) for more details about this dataset.2. **Stance Detection Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the health mandate related task, focusing on stance detection in tweets about COVID-19. The authors cite the work by Vera Davydova and Elena Tutubalina (2022) for this dataset.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For the **DeepADEMiner Dataset**, the citation is: > Arjun Magge, Elena Tutubalina, Zulfat Miftahutdinov, Ilseyar Alimova, Anne Dirkson, Suzan Verberne, Davy Weissenbacher, and Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez. *DeepADEMiner: a deep learning pharmacovigilance pipeline for extraction and normalization of adverse drug event mentions on Twitter*. In Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, pages 2184a2192, 2021.- For the **Stance Detection Dataset**, the citation is: > Vera Davydova and Elena Tutubalina. *SMM4H2022 Task 2: Dataset for stance and premise detection in tweets about health mandates related to COVID-19*. In Proceedings of the Seventh Social Media Mining for Health (#SMM4H) Workshop and Shared Task, pages a, 2022.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
