To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Connecting the Dots between Audio and Text without Parallel Data through Visual Knowledge Transfer" by Anonymous ACL submission, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the **ESC50 and US8K audio classification tasks**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methods. They mention using the **AudioSet** dataset for audio classification tasks, which is a strong indication that this dataset is significant for their research.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **AudioSet** dataset for audio classification tasks, confirming its importance. They also mention using **AudioCaps** and **Clotho** datasets for audio-text retrieval tasks, which further solidifies their dataset usage.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. **AudioSet**: The citation is: > Jort F. Gemmeke, Daniel P. W. Ellis, Dylan Freedman, Aren Jansen, Wade Lawrence, R. Channing Moore, Manoj Plakal, and Marvin Ritter. *AudioSet: An ontology and human-labeled dataset for audio events*. In 2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 776a780.2. **AudioCaps**: The citation is: > Chris Dongjoo Kim, Byeongchang Kim, Hyunmin Lee, and Gunhee Kim. *AudioCaps: Generating captions for audio in the wild*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 119a132, 2019.3. **Clotho**: The citation is: > Konstantinos Drossos, Samuel Lipping, and Tuomas Virtanen. *Clotho: an audio captioning dataset*. In 2020 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 736a740.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
