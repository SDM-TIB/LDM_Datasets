To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Task-Oriented Dialogue Architecture via Transformer Neural Language Models and Symbolic Injection" by Oscar J. Romero et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their system on the **DSTC8 dataset**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **method section**, where the authors describe their approach and mention the DSTC8 dataset again. They detail how they fine-tuned a pre-trained GPT-2 model using 16,548 dialogues from the DSTC8 dataset, which confirms its significance in their work.In the **results section**, the authors report their evaluation metrics based on the DSTC8 dataset, reinforcing its importance in their experiments. This section provides additional context about the dataset's size and the types of dialogues included, which is crucial for understanding its application.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the DSTC8 dataset. The authors reference the DSTC8 dataset as part of the **Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC8)**, which is a well-known benchmark for dialogue systems. The citation for the DSTC8 dataset is:> DSTC8 Dataset. *Dialogue System Technology Challenge*. Available at: https://github.com/google-research-datasets/dstc8-schema-guided-dialogueSince the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the DSTC8 dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the DSTC8 dataset, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
