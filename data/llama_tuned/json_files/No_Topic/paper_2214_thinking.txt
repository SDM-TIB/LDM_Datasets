To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Few-Shot Semantic Parser for Wizard-of-Oz Dialogues with the Precise ThingTalk+ Representation" by Mihail Eric et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new dialogue representation and mention the use of a dataset for evaluation, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of annotating dialogue data and mention the need for a high-quality training set. They reference the **MultiWOZ 3.0 dataset**, which is a reannotation of the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset, indicating that this is a key dataset used in their experiments.In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their training strategy and mention the use of synthesized data, paraphrased data, and few-shot training data. They also specify that the **MultiWOZ 3.0 dataset** is used for training and evaluation, confirming its importance in their experiments.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **MultiWOZ 3.0 dataset**. The citation is as follows:> Mihail Eric, Rahul Goel, Shachi Paul, Abhishek Sethi, Sanchit Agarwal, Shuyag Gao, and Dilek Hakkani-Tur. *MultiWOZ 2.1: Multi-domain dialogue state corrections and state tracking baselines*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.01669, 2019.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the **MultiWOZ 3.0 dataset**. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
