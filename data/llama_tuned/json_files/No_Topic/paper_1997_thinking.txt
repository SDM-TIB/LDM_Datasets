To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Open-domain question classification and completion in conversational information search" by Omid Mohammadi Kia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a conversational information search system, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, particularly in the context of the TREC CAsT dataset.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods section**. In the introduction, the authors mention the TREC CAsT dataset as one of the first attempts to build a framework for conversational search. This indicates that this dataset is crucial for their research.In the **methods section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the TREC CAsT dataset, stating that it includes 30 training topics and 50 assessment topics, along with three sets of data: MS MARCO, TREC CAR, and the Washington Post. This confirms the datasets used in their experiments.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **TREC CAsT dataset**, the citation is: > J. Dalton, C. Xiong, and J. Callan. *CAsT 2019: The Conversational Assistance Track Overview*. 2020.2. For the **MS MARCO dataset**, the citation is: > P. Bajaj et al. *MS MARCO: A Human Generated Machine Reading Comprehension Dataset*. 2016.3. For the **TREC CAR dataset**, the citation is: > L. Dietz, M. Verma, F. Radlinski, and N. C. *TREC Complex Answer Retrieval Overview*. 2017.4. For the **Washington Post dataset**, the citation is: > J. Dalton, C. Xiong, and J. Callan. *CAsT 2019: The Conversational Assistance Track Overview*. 2020.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
