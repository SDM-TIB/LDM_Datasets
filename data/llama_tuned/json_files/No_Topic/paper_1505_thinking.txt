To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training MRF-Based Phrase Translation Models using Gradient Ascent" by Jianfeng Gao and Xiaodong He, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two Europarl translation tasks, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. They mention two Europarl translation tasks: **German-English (DE-EN) and French-English (FR-EN)**. This is a strong indication that these tasks are based on specific datasets.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for training and testing their models. They specify that the DE-EN dataset contains 751K sentence pairs, with an average of 21 words per sentence, and the FR-EN dataset contains 688K sentence pairs with the same average word count. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the datasets as being published for the shared task in the NAACL 2006 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT06). The citation for the Europarl datasets is:> Koehn, P., & Monz, C. (2006). Manual and automatic evaluation of machine translation between European languages. In Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pp. 102-121.With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. The datasets identified are:1. **German-English (DE-EN)**: This dataset is used for the German-English translation task, containing 751K sentence pairs.2. **French-English (FR-EN)**: This dataset is used for the French-English translation task, containing 688K sentence pairs.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
