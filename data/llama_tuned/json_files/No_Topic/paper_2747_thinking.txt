To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Facial Emotion Distribution Learning by Exploiting Low-Rank Label Correlations Locally" by Xiuyi Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on benchmark facial expression datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4.1), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to two datasets:1. **s-JAFFE Dataset**: This dataset contains 213 grayscale images of 10 Japanese female models, each scored by 60 people on 6 basic emotions (happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, anger, and disgust) using a five-level scale. The average score for each emotion is used to represent the emotion distribution.2. **SBU 3DFE Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2500 images, and the emotion distribution of each image is obtained using the same method as s-JAFFE. Additionally, a 243-dimensional feature vector is extracted from each image using the Local Binary Patterns (LBP) method.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **s-JAFFE Dataset**, the citation is: > M. Lyons, S. Akamatsu, M. Kamachi, and J. Gyoba. *Coding Facial Expressions with Gabor Wavelets*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, pages 200a205, 2002.- For the **SBU 3DFE Dataset**, the citation is: > Lijun Yin, Xiaozhou Wei, Yi Sun, Jun Wang, and Matthew J. Rosato. *A 3D Facial Expression Database for Facial Behavior Research*. In International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, pages 211a216, 2006.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
