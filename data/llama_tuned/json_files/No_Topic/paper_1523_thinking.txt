To extract datasets from the research paper titled "L2-Net: Deep Learning of Discriminative Patch Descriptor in Euclidean Space" by Yurun Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets used for their experiments. The introduction discusses the evolution of local patch descriptors and mentions the Brown datasets and the Oxford dataset, indicating that these are the datasets used for evaluation.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **Brown dataset** and the **HPatches dataset** for their experiments. This confirms that these datasets are crucial for their research.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. **Brown Dataset**: The citation is: > M. Brown, G. Hua, and S.A.G. Winder. *Discriminative learning of local image descriptors*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2010.2. **HPatches Dataset**: The citation is: > V. Balntas, K. Lenc, A. Vedaldi, and K. Mikolajczyk. *HPatches: A benchmark and evaluation of handcrafted and learned local descriptors*. In CVPR, 2017.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
