To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CI-AVSR: A Cantonese Audio-Visual Speech Dataset for In-car Command Recognition" by Wenliang Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset collection sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces a new dataset called **Cantonese In-car Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (CI-AVSR)**, which indicates that this is a primary dataset of interest.Next, I will focus on the **dataset collection section** to gather detailed information about the CI-AVSR dataset. The authors describe the dataset as consisting of 4,984 samples (8.3 hours) of 200 in-car commands recorded by 30 native Cantonese speakers. They also mention that the dataset is augmented with 10 common in-car background noises to simulate real environments, resulting in a dataset that is 10 times larger than the original clean dataset.I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors reference any other datasets used for evaluation or comparison. However, it appears that the CI-AVSR dataset is the primary focus of their research.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the CI-AVSR dataset. The citation is as follows:- For the **Cantonese In-car Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (CI-AVSR)** dataset, the citation is: > Dai, W., Cahyawijaya, S., Liu, Z., and Fung, P. *CI-AVSR: A Cantonese Audio-Visual Speech Recognition Dataset for In-car Command Recognition*. In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 5305a5316, Online, June 2021. Association for Computational Linguistics.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for CI-AVSR, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
