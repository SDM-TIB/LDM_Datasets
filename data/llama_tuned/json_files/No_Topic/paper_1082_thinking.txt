To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Exact Penalty Method for Locally Convergent Maximum Consensus" by Huu Le, Tat-Jun Chin, and David Suter, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a maximum consensus algorithm, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their method. In this section, they mention using the **VGG dataset** for fundamental matrix estimation and affinity estimation tasks. They specify that they used five image pairs from the VGG dataset, which indicates that this is a key dataset for their experiments.I will also check the **results section** to confirm the datasets used and any additional details provided about their application. The authors mention that they used the **Notre Dame dataset** for triangulation tasks, which is another dataset relevant to their work.Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **VGG dataset**, the citation is: > Olsson, C., Enqvist, O., & Kahl, F. (2008). A polynomial-time bound for matching and registration with outliers. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2008. CVPR 2008. IEEE Conference on (pp. 1a8). IEEE.2. For the **Notre Dame dataset**, the citation is: > Snavely, N., Seitz, S. M., & Szeliski, R. (2006). Photo tourism: exploring photo collections in 3D. In ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 25, 835a846. ACM.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
