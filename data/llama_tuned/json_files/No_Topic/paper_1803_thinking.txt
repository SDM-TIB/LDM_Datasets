To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Graphical Model Approach for Matching Partial Signatures" by Xianzhi Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on three datasets derived from the DS-I Tobacco signature dataset and the DS-II UMD dataset, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:1. **DS-I Tobacco signature dataset**: This dataset contains 189 relatively clean and high-quality signatures from 63 authors, with three signatures per author. It includes full signatures, which are used for training and testing.2. **DS-II UMD signature dataset**: This dataset consists of 26661 signatures from 887 authors, which is a more challenging dataset as it includes a mix of full signatures and partial signatures, along with various degradations such as low-quality signatures, machine-printed texts, and occluded signatures. The authors created two partial signature datasets based on these datasets: - **DS-I partial dataset**: A subset of the DS-I Tobacco signature dataset, created by clipping out the first names of all full signatures to generate partial signatures. - **DS-II partial dataset**: A subset of the DS-II UMD signature dataset, containing 495 full signatures for training and 1732 signatures (both full and partial) for testing.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **DS-I Tobacco signature dataset**, the citation is: > Lamp.cfar.umd.edu. *DS-I Tobacco signature dataset*. [No specific citation provided in the paper, but it is referenced as a source for the dataset].- For the **DS-II UMD signature dataset**, the citation is: > Lamp.cfar.umd.edu. *DS-II UMD signature dataset*. [No specific citation provided in the paper, but it is referenced as a source for the dataset].Since the datasets are derived from the same source, I will use the same citation for both datasets.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as they are crucial for proper attribution and reference in future work. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
