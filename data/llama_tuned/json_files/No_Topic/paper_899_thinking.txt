To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MixedEmotions: Social Semantic Emotion Analysis for Innovative Multilingual Big Data Analytics Markets ICT-15-2014" by Millward Brown, Czech Republic, Academic Partners, Insight Centre for Data Analytics, National University of Ireland, Galway, and others, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the project's focus on emotion analysis and mentions the use of various data sources, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any specific datasets or references to datasets used in the research. The introduction highlights the challenges of analyzing user interactions across multiple languages and modalities, indicating that datasets are crucial for the project's success.I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. However, it appears that the paper does not provide a specific list of datasets used in the research. Instead, it discusses the need for integrated emotion analysis across heterogeneous data sources, which implies that the datasets are likely to be diverse and not explicitly listed.In the **results and discussion sections**, the authors describe the integrated Big Linked Data platform but do not provide specific dataset names. Therefore, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the authors' work or if they reference any existing datasets that are relevant to their research.After reviewing the paper, it seems that the authors do not provide specific dataset names or citations. The focus is more on the methodology and the challenges of emotion analysis rather than on specific datasets. Therefore, I will conclude that while the paper discusses the need for datasets, it does not provide explicit names or citations for any datasets used in their research.Finally, I will summarize my findings, noting that while the paper discusses the importance of datasets in emotion analysis, it does not provide specific dataset information for extraction.
