To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ICARUS: An Extensible Graphical Search Tool for Dependency Treebanks" by Markus Gärtner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the tool ICARUS and its application in dependency treebanks, which suggests that datasets related to these treebanks may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methodology sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of linguistically annotated corpora and mention the use of dependency treebanks, indicating that datasets related to these treebanks are likely included. I will look for specific names or references to datasets in these sections.In the **methodology section**, particularly in the context of the examples provided, the authors reference the **CoNLL 2008 Shared Task dataset** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that this dataset is used in their work.I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used for testing and validation. The authors describe their search queries and results, which further supports the relevance of the CoNLL 2008 Shared Task dataset.Now, I will consult the **references section** to retrieve the full citation for the CoNLL 2008 Shared Task dataset. The citation is as follows:> Mihai Surdeanu, Richard Johansson, Adam Meyers, Lluís As Márquez, and Joakim Nivre. *The CoNLL 2008 Shared Task on Joint Parsing of Syntactic and Semantic Dependencies*. In CoNLL 2008, pages 159a177, Manchester, England, 2008.Since the paper primarily focuses on ICARUS and its interaction with dependency treebanks, I will ensure to include this dataset in my extraction.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation, ensuring that it is ready for further processing or review.
