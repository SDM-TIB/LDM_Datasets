To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Near-Optimal Smoothing of Structured Conditional Probability Matrices" by Moein Falahatgar and Mesrob I. Ohannessian, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of low-rank conditional probability matrices and mentions experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using both synthetic and real datasets for their experiments. The datasets include:1. **Tartuffe**: A French text dataset with a size of 9.3k words and a vocabulary size of 2.8k words.2. **Genesis**: An English version of the Genesis dataset, containing 19k words and a vocabulary size of 4.4k words.3. **Brown**: A shortened version of the Brown corpus, consisting of 20k words and a vocabulary size of 10.5k words.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **Tartuffe**, the citation is: > "Tartuffe".- For **Genesis**, the citation is: > "Genesis".- For **Brown**, the citation is: > "Brown Corpus".Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution and reference in future work. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations from the paper.
