To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SCAR: Sentence Compression using Autoencoders for Reconstruction" by Chanakya Malireddy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **Gigaword corpus** and the **DUC-2003 and DUC-2004 datasets** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their research.I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. **Gigaword Corpus**: The citation is: > Alexander M. Rush, Sumit Chopra, and Jason Weston. *A neural attention model for abstractive sentence summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 379a389, Lisbon, Portugal, 2015.2. **DUC-2003 Dataset**: The citation is: > Paul Over, Hoa Dang, and Donna Harman. *DUC-2003: A dataset for the DUC-2003 shared task on automatic summarization*. Information Processing & Management, 43(6):1506a1520, 2007.3. **DUC-2004 Dataset**: The citation is: > Paul Over, Hoa Dang, and Donna Harman. *DUC-2004: A dataset for the DUC-2004 shared task on automatic summarization*. Information Processing & Management, 43(6):1506a1520, 2007.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
