To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mental Health Surveillance over Social Media with Digital Cohorts" by Silvio Amir, Mark Dredze, and John W. Ayers, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a cohort of US-based Twitter users to measure the prevalence of depression and PTSD, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically the subsections that describe the dataset construction process. Here, the authors mention that they developed a digital cohort of Twitter users, which is a key dataset for their analysis.In the **methodology subsection**, they detail the process of selecting Twitter users and inferring demographic attributes. They specify that the cohort consists of 48,000 Twitter users, which is a significant dataset for their study.I will also check the **results section** to see if they reference any specific datasets or provide additional details about the cohort. The authors discuss the demographic composition of the cohort and the mental health conditions they analyzed, but they do not mention any external datasets in this section.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the following datasets:- For the **Twitter cohort**, the citation is: > Amir, S., Dredze, M., & Ayers, J. W. (2017). Quantifying mental health from social media with neural user embeddings. In Proceedings of the 2nd Machine Learning for Healthcare Conference (pp. 306-321). PMLR.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Twitter cohort dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Twitter cohort, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
