To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Supervised Hashing with Anchor Graph" by Yudong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three large-scale datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three datasets: **CIFAR-10**, **Fashion-MNIST**, and **NUS-WIDE**. I will extract details about each dataset, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide the following information about each dataset:1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for image classification tasks.2. **Fashion-MNIST**: This dataset contains 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items, divided into 10 classes, with 7,000 images per class. It is widely used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.3. **NUS-WIDE**: This dataset is a multi-label dataset containing 13,400 images across 21 categories, with at least 5,000 images per category. It is designed for image retrieval tasks.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, 2009.- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is: > Zalando Research. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017.- For **NUS-WIDE**, the citation is: > Wei Liu, Jun Wang, Sanjiv Kumar, and Shih-Fu Chang. *Hashing with graphs*. In ICML, pages 1a8, 2011.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
