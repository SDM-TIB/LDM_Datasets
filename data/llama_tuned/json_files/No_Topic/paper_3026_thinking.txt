To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-lingual RDF Thesauri Interlinking" by Tatiana Lesnikova and Jerome Euzenat, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of machine translation for interlinking concepts across different thesauri, which suggests that datasets related to these thesauri may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention two specific datasets:1. **TheSoz multilingual thesaurus**: This dataset is used for the first experiment, containing concepts with labels in English, French, and German. The authors specify that it has 8223 concepts in total for each language, with 12 concepts lacking an English label and 6 lacking a French label.2. **EuroVoc and AGROVOC thesauri**: For the second experiment, the authors utilize multilingual thesauri from EuroVoc and AGROVOC, focusing on concepts in English and Chinese. They mention that they extracted entities from an existing reference alignment, resulting in 1300 concepts in English and 1300 concepts in Chinese.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **TheSoz multilingual thesaurus**, the citation is: > Zapilko, B., Schaible, J., Mayr, P., and Mathiak, B. *TheSoz: A SKOS Representation of the Thesaurus for the Social Sciences*. Semantic Web journal (SWJ), 4(3):257a263, 2013.- For **EuroVoc and AGROVOC thesauri**, the citation is: > EuroVoc. *EuroVoc: A Multilingual Thesaurus in 23 Languages*. Available at: http://eurovoc.europa.eu/ and > AGROVOC. *AGROVOC: A Multilingual Thesaurus for Agricultural and Food Sciences*. Available at: http://aims.fao.org/standards/agrovoc/concept-schemeAfter gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
