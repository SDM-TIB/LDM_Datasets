To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Debiasing Pretrained Text Encoders by Paying Attention to Paying Attention" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for debiasing in NLP models, which suggests that datasets related to bias evaluation might be included.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **evaluation sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the use of **StereoSet** and **Crows-Pairs** for measuring bias in language models. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They mention that they applied their method to **StereoSet** and **Crows-Pairs** for evaluating the effectiveness of their debiasing approach. This confirms that these datasets are indeed used in their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:1. For **StereoSet**, the citation is: > Moin Nadeem, Anna Bethke, and Siva Reddy. *StereoSet: Measuring stereotypical bias in pretrained language models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.09456, 2020.2. For **Crows-Pairs**, the citation is: > Nikita Nangia, Clara Vania, Rasika Bhalerao, and Samuel R Bowman. *Crows-Pairs: A challenged dataset for measuring social biases in masked language models*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2020.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
