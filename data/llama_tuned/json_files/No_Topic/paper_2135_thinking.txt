To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PTB Graph Parsing with Tree Approximation" by Yoshihide Kato and Shigeki Matsubara, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the Penn Treebank (PTB) for syntactic structure representation, which suggests that this is a key dataset.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors explicitly mention the **Penn Treebank (PTB)** as the dataset used for their experiments. This is a strong indication that PTB is the primary dataset utilized in their research.In the **methods section**, the authors describe their approach to converting PTB graphs into augmented trees, which further confirms the use of PTB. They also mention using the **Kitaev and Klein parser** for parsing tasks, but the primary dataset remains the PTB.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Penn Treebank. The citation is as follows:- For the **Penn Treebank (PTB)**, the citation is: > Mitchell P. Marcus, Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: the Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):310a330, 1993.Since the paper primarily focuses on the PTB and does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the PTB.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the PTB, ensuring that I include all relevant details and the full citation, ready for further processing or review.
