To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Annotated Social Media Corpus for German Hate Speech" by Eckhard Bick, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a large bilingual Social Media corpus for Hate Speech research, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to gather more context about the datasets. The authors mention that the corpus is based on data collected from Twitter and Facebook, which indicates that these platforms are likely sources of the datasets.I will then examine the **corpus description** section, specifically looking for details about the datasets used for annotation and analysis. The authors describe the corpus size and the types of data collected, including tweets and comments, which further confirms the datasets' relevance.In the **data selection and filtering section**, the authors discuss the process of extracting smaller sub-corpora for manual inspection, which implies that they have created or utilized specific datasets for their analysis. I will look for any specific names or references to datasets in this section.In the **preprocessing and annotation** section, the authors describe the linguistic annotation process, which may include datasets related to the annotation of hate speech. However, they do not provide specific dataset names here, so I will need to look for more detailed information in the **evaluation section** or the **references** to find full citations for the datasets used.After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The paper references several other works that may provide context or additional datasets relevant to the study. I will ensure to include these citations as well.Once I have gathered all the necessary information, including the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
