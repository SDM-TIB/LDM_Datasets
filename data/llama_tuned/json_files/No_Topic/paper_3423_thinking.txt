To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SciPar: A Collection of Parallel Corpora from Scientific Abstracts" by Dimitris Roussis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a new collection of parallel corpora from openly available metadata of bachelor theses, master theses, and doctoral dissertations, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the harvesting and processing of metadata from 86 repositories. They mention that the data were assembled from various institutional repositories, which implies that these repositories are the datasets used.In the **results section**, the authors provide details about the composition of the SciPar corpus, stating that it includes 9.17 million sentence pairs in 31 language pairs. This confirms that the datasets are related to the collection of scientific abstracts.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference several other datasets that are relevant to their work, including:1. **CAPES**: A parallel corpus extracted from the body responsible for overseeing post-graduate programs. The citation is: > Soares, F., Yamashita, G. H., and Anzanello, M. J. *A parallel corpus of theses and dissertations abstracts*. In International Conference on Computational Processing of the Portuguese Language, pages 345-352, Springer, Cham, 2018.2. **OPUS**: A parallel corpus of scientific articles. The citation is: > Tiedemann, J. *Parallel Data, Tools and Interfaces in OPUS*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Language and Evaluation (LREC 2012), pages 2214-2218.3. **Scielo Corpus**: A parallel corpus of scientific publications for biomedicine. The citation is: > Neves, M., Yepes, A. J., and NAvAol, A. *The SciELO corpus: a parallel corpus of scientific publications for biomedicine*. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LRECa16), pages 2942-2948.4. **ASPEC**: A large parallel corpus of scientific papers. The citation is: > Nakazawa, T., Yaguchi, M., Uchimoto, K., Utiyama, M., Sumita, E., Kurohashi, S., and Isahara, H. *ASPEC: Asian Scientific Paper Excerpt Corpus*. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016), pages 2204-2208.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
