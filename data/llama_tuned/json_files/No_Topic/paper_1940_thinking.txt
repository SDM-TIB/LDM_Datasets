To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Annotated Corpus for Sentiment Analysis in Political News" by Gabriel Domingos de Arruda et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a corpus of news texts in Brazilian Portuguese, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets or sources of data. They discuss the need for annotated corpora for sentiment analysis and reference existing datasets, but I need to find the specific datasets used in their own work.In the **materials and methods section**, the authors describe the data collection process, which includes extracting news from Twitter profiles. They mention that they collected news from four big newswire outlets and segmented it into paragraphs. This indicates that they created a dataset based on their own collection process.I will also look for any references to existing datasets in the **related work section** to see if they cite any previous datasets that inform their own work. The authors mention several existing datasets, such as CSTNews, CHAVE, and TeMArio, which are relevant to their research.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The relevant citations are:- For the **CSTNews** dataset, the citation is: > Cardoso, P. C. F., Maziero, E. G., Jorge, M. L. R. C., Seno, E. M. R., Felippo, A. D., Rino, L. H. M., das GracA s V. Nunes, M., and Pardo, T. A. S. *CSTNews: a discourse-annotated corpus for single and multi-document summarization of news texts in Brazilian Portuguese*. In Proceedings of the 3rd RST Brazilian Meeting, pages 88a105, CuiabA a/MT, Brazil, 2011.- For the **CHAVE** dataset, the citation is: > Rocha, P. and Santos, D. *CetempA publico: um corpus de grandes dimensEoes de In Actas do V Encontro para o processamentoolinguagem jornalA Astica portuguesa.computacional da lA Angua portuguesa escrita e falada (PROPOR 2000)*, pages 131a140, Atibaia, SEao Paulo, Brazil, 2000.- For the **TeMArio** dataset, the citation is: > Pardo, T. A. S. and Rino, L. H. M. *TeMArio: Um corpus para sumarizacA Eao au-tomA atica de textos*. Technical Report NILC-TR-03-09, NILC - ICMC-USP, SEao Carlos, SP, Brazil, 2003.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
