To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ordinal Sentiment Classification Using a Recurrent Convolutional Network" by Yunchao He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses sentiment analysis and mentions the use of a recurrent convolutional network, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of sentiment classification.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **SemEval-2016 Task 4 dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is specifically designed for sentiment analysis in tweets, which aligns with the paper's focus on ordinal sentiment classification.I will also check the **dataset statistics** table provided in the paper, which lists the number of tweets and the distribution of sentiment labels. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and characteristics.Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the SemEval-2016 Task 4 dataset. The citation is as follows:> Preslav Nakov, Alan Ritter, Sara Rosenthal, Veselin Stoyanov, and Fabrizio Sebastiani. *SemEval-2016 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter*. In Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, Association for Computational Linguistics, 2016.Since the paper does not mention any additional datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the SemEval-2016 Task 4 dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the SemEval-2016 Task 4 dataset, ensuring that it includes all relevant details and the full citation.
