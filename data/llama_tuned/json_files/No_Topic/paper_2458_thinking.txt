To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Section-Aware Commonsense Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Generation with Pre-trained Language Model" by Sixing Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of pre-trained language models and mentions a dataset, which indicates that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **Weibo dataset** for their experiments. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its size, structure, and any relevant characteristics.In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they evaluate their model on the **Weibo dataset**, which is described as containing more than 1 million dialogues collected from the largest Chinese SNS Weibo and commonsense knowledge facts from ConceptNet. This gives me a good idea of the dataset's scope and purpose.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Weibo dataset. The citation is as follows:- For the **Weibo dataset**, the citation is: > Sixing Wu, Ying Li, Dawei Zhang, Yang Zhou, and Zhonghai Wu. *Diverse and informative dialogue generation with context-specific commonsense knowledge awareness*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 5811a5820, 2020.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Weibo dataset as it is the only dataset mentioned in the paper.
