To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modelling Regular Subcategorization Changes in German Particle Verbs" by Stefan Bott and Sabine Schulte im Walde, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the prediction of syntactic slot correspondences between base and particle verbs, which suggests that datasets related to these verbs might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**. Here, the authors mention that they selected a set of 32 particle verbs from the Fleischer and Barz (2012) corpus, which is a significant dataset for their experiments. This indicates that this corpus is crucial for their work.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Fleischer and Barz (2012) corpus. The citation is as follows:> Wolfgang Fleischer and Irmhild Barz. *Wortbildung der deutschen Gegenwartssprache*. Walter de Gruyter, 4th edition, 2012.Now, I will summarize the dataset information:1. **Fleischer and Barz (2012) Corpus**: This dataset contains a set of 32 German particle verbs, which is essential for the authors' experiments. The citation is:> Wolfgang Fleischer and Irmhild Barz. *Wortbildung der deutschen Gegenwartssprache*. Walter de Gruyter, 4th edition, 2012.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
