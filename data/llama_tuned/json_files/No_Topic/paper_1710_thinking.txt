To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Demographic Word Embeddings for Racism Detection on Twitter" by Mohammed Hasanuzzaman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a supervised learning strategy for detecting racist language on Twitter, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of training and evaluation.Next, I will focus on the **data sets section** (section 3) where the authors describe the datasets used in their research. Here, they mention two primary datasets:1. **Unlabeled Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 17.2 million potentially racist tweets collected from Twitter over a three-month period. The authors describe how they filtered the dataset to include tweets containing specific keywords related to racial and ethnic slurs.2. **Classification Dataset**: This dataset is a gold standard dataset created through a crowdsourcing platform, containing 8,358 tweets annotated by users to determine whether they are racist or not. The dataset is designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed classification models.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:- For the **Unlabeled Dataset**, the citation is: > Leandro Silva, Mainack Modal, Denzil Correa, Fabrio Benevenuto, and Ingmar Weber. *Analyzing the targets of hate in online social media*. In Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM 2016).- For the **Classification Dataset**, the citation is: > Pete Burnap and Matthew L. Williams. *Us and them: identifying cyber hate on Twitter across multiple protected characteristics*. EPJ Data Science, 5(1):11, 2016.Now that I have gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
