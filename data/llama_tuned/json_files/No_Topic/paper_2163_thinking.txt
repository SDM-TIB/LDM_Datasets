To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stacked Ensembles of Information Extractors for Knowledge-Base Population" by Nazneen Fatema Rajani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of stacking ensembles for the Knowledge Base Population (KBP) English Slot Filling task, which suggests that datasets related to this task may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** (section 5) where the authors describe their methodology and results. Here, they mention two datasets:1. **Common Systems Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the 2013 and 2014 KBP-ESF competitions, containing data from 10 common teams that participated in both years. It includes various systems' outputs and is used for training and testing the stacking approach.2. **All 2014 SFV Systems Dataset**: This dataset comprises all 65 systems that participated in the 2014 KBP Slot Filler Validation (SFV) task. It is used for evaluating the stacking approach against other ensembling methods.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Common Systems Dataset**, the citation is: > Mihai Surdeanu and Heng Ji. *Overview of the English slot filling track at the TAC2014 KnowledgeBase Population Evaluation*. In Proceedings of the Seventh Text Analysis Conference (TAC2014).- For the **All 2014 SFV Systems Dataset**, the citation is: > Mihai Surdeanu and Heng Ji. *Overview of the English slot filling track at the TAC2014 KnowledgeBase Population Evaluation*. In Proceedings of the Seventh Text Analysis Conference (TAC2014).After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
