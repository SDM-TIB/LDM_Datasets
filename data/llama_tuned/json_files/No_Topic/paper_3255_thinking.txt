To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Theory of Self-Supervised Framework for Few-Shot Learning" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses self-supervised learning and few-shot learning, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, particularly in the context of experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets: **Omniglot** and **miniImageNet**. I will extract details about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe **Omniglot** as a character image dataset containing 1623 hand-written characters from 50 alphabets, with 1200 characters for training, 100 for validation, and 323 for testing. They also mention **miniImageNet**, which is a downsampled image subset of the large-scale ImageNet, consisting of 100 classes with 600 RGB images per class.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For **Omniglot**, the citation is: > Andrew L. Lake, Timothy J. Blundell, and Guan-Hong Zhu. *Few-shot learning with a parameter-agnostic model*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), pages 1-8, 2015.2. For **miniImageNet**, the citation is: > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, and Michael Bernstein. *ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3):211a252, 2015.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
