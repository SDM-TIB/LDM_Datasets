To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiway Attention Networks for Modeling Sentence Pairs" by Chuanqi Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on four standard benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention four datasets:1. **Quora Question Pairs**: This dataset consists of over 400,000 question pairs, with each pair annotated as either paraphrases or not. The authors specify that they used 5,000 paraphrases and 5,000 non-paraphrases for development and testing.2. **SNLI**: This dataset is a natural language inference dataset containing 570,152 sentence pairs, labeled with relationships such as entailment, contradiction, and neutral. The authors note that they used 549,367 pairs for training, 9,842 for development, and 9,824 for testing.3. **MultiNLI**: This dataset is also a natural language inference dataset, containing 392,702 pairs for training, 9,815 matched pairs, and 9,832 mismatched pairs for development and testing.4. **SQuAD**: This dataset is a reading comprehension dataset where the answer to each question is a span of text from the corresponding passage. The authors split the development set into 5,000 for development and 5,570 for testing.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **Quora Question Pairs**, the citation is: > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In EMNLP, 2015.- For **SNLI**, the citation is: > Samuel R. Bowman, Jon Gauthier, Abhinav Rastogi, Raghav Gupta, D. Christopher Manning, and Christopher Potts. *A fast unified model for parsing and sentence understanding*. In ACL, pages 1466a1477, 2016.- For **MultiNLI**, the citation is: > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel R. Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.05426, 2017.- For **SQuAD**, the citation is: > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Constantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In EMNLP, 2016.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
