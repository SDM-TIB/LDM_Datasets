To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Less is More: Attention Supervision with Counterfactuals for Text Classification" by Seungtaek Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on three popular datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled **"4.1 Datasets."** Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:1. **SST2**: This dataset is described as containing around 11K sentences tagged with sentiment on a scale from 1 (most negative) to 5 (most positive). The authors mention that they filtered out neutral samples and dichotomized the remaining sentences into positive and negative categories.2. **IMDB**: This dataset consists of 50K movie reviews, split into half for training and testing, with a focus on binary sentiment classification.3. **20NG**: This dataset contains around 19K documents categorized into 20 different categories, with the authors extracting samples belonging to the "Baseball" and "Hockey" classes for a binary classification task.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For **SST2**, the citation is: > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-10, 2013.- For **IMDB**, the citation is: > Andrew L Maas, Raymond E Daly, Peter T Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 1-10, 2011.- For **20NG**, the citation is: > Andrew L Maas, Raymond E Daly, Peter T Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 1-10, 2011.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
