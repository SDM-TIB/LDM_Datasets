To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Lexical and Syntactic Features for Language Variety Identification" by Chris van der Lee and Antal van den Bosch, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a feature bundle for language variety identification, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention the **SUBTIEL corpus**, which contains over 500,000 subtitles in Dutch and English. This is a clear indication that this is a dataset used in their experiments.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SUBTIEL corpus. The citation is as follows:> Trieschnigg, D., Hiemstra, D., Theune, M., de Jong, F., & Meder, T. (2012). An exploration of language identification techniques for the Dutch folktales database. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Adaptation of Language Resources and Tools for Processing Cultural Heritage, pages 47a51.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its reference from the paper.
