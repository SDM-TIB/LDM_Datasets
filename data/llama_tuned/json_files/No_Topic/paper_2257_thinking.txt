To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Small-Variance Asymptotics for Hidden Markov Models" by Anirban Roychowdhury, Ke Jiang, and Brian Kulis, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of small-variance asymptotics to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and mentions experiments on synthetic and real datasets, indicating that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention two specific datasets:1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors describe a synthetic dataset generated for their experiments, consisting of a sequence of length 3000 with observations sampled from symmetric Gaussian distributions. This dataset is used to compare their nonparametric algorithm against the Beam Sampler for the iHMM.2. **Real-World Data**: The authors also refer to a well-known financial dataset, the **S&P 500 index**, which is used for time-series prediction. This dataset is referenced in the context of evaluating the performance of their algorithms.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Synthetic Data**, since it is generated by the authors, there is no external citation. However, I will note that it is a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of the experiments.- For the **S&P 500 index**, the citation is: > Standard & Poor's. *S&P 500 Index*. Available at: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/SP500/downloaddataAfter gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the descriptions and citations as accurately as possible. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
