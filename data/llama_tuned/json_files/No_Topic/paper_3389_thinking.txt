To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Robust Learning to Optimize with Theoretical Guarantees" by Qingyu Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a robust learning to optimize (L2O) model, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention using a synthetic dataset of 32,000 optimization problems with randomly sampled parameters and optimal solutions, as well as a test dataset of 1,000 iterations of objective values derived from 1,024 pre-generated optimization problems. This indicates that there are two datasets used in their experiments:1. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset consists of 32,000 optimization problems with randomly sampled parameters and optimal solutions. The authors generated this dataset for their experiments.2. **Test Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,000 iterations of objective values derived from 1,024 pre-generated optimization problems. It is used for evaluating the performance of their proposed model.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Synthetic Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, as it is a custom dataset created by the authors. However, I will note that it is derived from their own experiments.- For the **Test Dataset**, the citation is not directly available either, as it is also a custom dataset created for the purpose of this study. Therefore, I will note that it is derived from the authors' own experiments.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the descriptions and citations as accurately as possible. Since the datasets are custom and not publicly available, I will note that they are original datasets created by the authors for the purpose of their research.
