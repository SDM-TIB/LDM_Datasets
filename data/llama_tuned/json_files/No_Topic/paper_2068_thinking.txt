To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expressing the Opposite: Acoustic Cues of Thai Verbal Irony" by Nimit Kumwapee and Sujinat Jitwiriyanont, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves acoustic analysis of Thai verbal irony, which suggests that there may be datasets related to speech data or recordings.Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsections that describe the data collection process. Here, the authors mention that they conducted two reading tasks involving 30 sentences and a biasing situation for each sentence. This indicates that they collected data from participants, which could be considered a dataset.In the **data collection section**, the authors specify that they recorded speech samples from four Thai speakers, which further confirms the existence of a dataset. They also mention that the data includes acoustic measures such as speech rate, F0 mean, and amplitude mean, which are typical metrics in speech analysis.Now, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets or data collection methods. However, the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, as it appears to focus on the analysis of acoustic cues rather than a pre-existing dataset.The authors refer to previous studies that analyzed acoustic cues of sarcasm in different languages, but they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation for their own data collection. Therefore, I will summarize the findings based on the information provided in the paper, noting that the dataset consists of recordings from four Thai speakers participating in reading tasks, but without a formal dataset name or citation.Since the paper does not provide a formal dataset name or citation, I will create a summary entry based on the information gathered:1. **Thai Verbal Irony Dataset**: This dataset consists of recordings of four Thai speakers participating in reading tasks to analyze acoustic cues of sarcasm. The dataset includes 30 sentences and a biasing situation for each sentence, which were recorded using a mobile application.Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I have accurately captured the essence of the dataset and its context in the research paper.
