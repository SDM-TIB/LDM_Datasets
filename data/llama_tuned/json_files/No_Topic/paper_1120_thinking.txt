To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Social Media Posts as Knowledge Resource for Generating Life Stories" by Robee Khyra Mae J. TeDe La Salle University et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilized Facebook data to extract events for generating life stories, which suggests that a dataset related to social media posts is involved.Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically the subsection titled "Gathering Storytelling Knowledge." Here, the authors describe the collection of 21,412 social media posts from 216 user accounts, which is a clear indication of a dataset. They mention that the posts were gathered using Facebook's Graph API, which is a crucial detail for the dataset's identity.I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional context or details about the dataset, such as its size, structure, or any specific characteristics that might be relevant for understanding its purpose.In the **references section**, I will look for the full citation related to the dataset. The authors reference Facebook as the source of the data, but they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation. However, I can infer that the dataset is derived from Facebook posts, and I will note that the dataset is based on user-generated content from Facebook.Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation. Since the paper does not provide a formal dataset name, I will refer to the dataset as "Facebook Social Media Posts" and describe it as containing 21,412 posts from 216 user accounts, annotated with various event categories.After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
