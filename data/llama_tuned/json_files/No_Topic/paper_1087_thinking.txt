To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Transfer Learning and Domain Data Selection for the Bio-medical translation" by Noor-e-Hira et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the following datasets:1. **News-Commentary (Tiedemann, 2012)**: This dataset is used as a general domain corpus for information retrieval.2. **Medline abstracts training corpus**: This dataset is used as an in-domain corpus for training the NMT system.3. **Scielo corpus**: This dataset is also used as an in-domain corpus, specifically for the English to French translation task.4. **EMEA corpus**: This dataset is another in-domain corpus used for training the NMT system.5. **Medline titles training corpus**: This dataset serves as a test set for evaluating the performance of the NMT systems.6. **Books corpus**: This dataset is used as an out-of-domain corpus for training the NMT system.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **News-Commentary**, the citation is: > Jrg Tiedemann. *Parallel data, tools and interfaces in opus*. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2012), pages 1-8, 2012.- For **Medline abstracts training corpus**, the citation is: > Antonio Jimeno Yepes, AurA elie Nvol, Mariana Neves, Karin Verspoor, Ondrej Bojar, Arthur Boyer, Cristian Grozea, Barry Haddow, Madeleine Kittner, and Yvonne Lichtblau. *Findings of the WMT 2017 biomedical translation shared task*. In Proceedings of the Second Conference on Machine Translation: Shared Task Papers, pages 234a247, 2017.- For **Scielo corpus**, the citation is: > Mariana Neves, Antonio Jimeno Yepes, and Aurlie Nvol. *The scielo corpus: a parallel corpus for scientific publications for biomedicine*. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016), pages 1-8, 2016.- For **EMEA corpus**, the citation is: > Jrg Tiedemann. *Parallel data, tools and interfaces in opus*. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2012), pages 1-8, 2012.- For **Medline titles training corpus**, the citation is: > Antonio Jimeno Yepes, AurA elie Nvol, Mariana Neves, Karin Verspoor, Ondrej Bojar, Arthur Boyer, Cristian Grozea, Barry Haddow, Madeleine Kittner, and Yvonne Lichtblau. *Findings of the WMT 2017 biomedical translation shared task*. In Proceedings of the Second Conference on Machine Translation: Shared Task Papers, pages 234a247, 2017.- For **Books corpus**, the citation is: > Antonio Jimeno Yepes, AurA elie Nvol, Mariana Neves, Karin Verspoor, Ondrej Bojar, Arthur Boyer, Cristian Grozea, Barry Haddow, Madeleine Kittner, and Yvonne Lichtblau. *Findings of the WMT 2017 biomedical translation shared task*. In Proceedings of the Second Conference on Machine Translation: Shared Task Papers, pages 234a247, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the references found in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
