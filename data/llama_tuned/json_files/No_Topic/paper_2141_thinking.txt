To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Sample Reweighting for Adversarial Robustness" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed method and mentions evaluating it on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they explicitly mention using the following datasets:1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition.2. **F-MNIST**: An extension of the MNIST dataset that includes additional classes.3. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.4. **CIFAR-100**: A dataset similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, containing 60,000 32x32 color images.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For **MNIST**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010. URL http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.- For **F-MNIST**, the citation is: > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. CoRR, abs/1708.07747, 2017.- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. URL http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-100 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. URL http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
