To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modality-Agnostic Learning for Radar-Lidar Fusion in Vehicle Detection" by Yu-Jhe Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the fusion of multiple sensor modalities, which suggests that datasets related to these modalities may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset. The citation is as follows:> Dan Barnes, Matthew Gadd, Paul Murcutt, Paul Newman, and Ingmar Posner. *The Oxford Radar Robotcar Dataset: A Radar extension to the Oxford Robotcar Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 6433a6438, IEEE, 2020.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and citation, which is essential for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent analysis or application of the findings.
