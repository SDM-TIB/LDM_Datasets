To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training with Growing Sets: A Simple Alternative to Curriculum Learning and Self-Paced Learning" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of various training methods and hints at the datasets used for evaluation, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that describe the experiments. Here, the authors mention that they tested their methods on **36 datasets retrieved from the UCI repository**. This indicates that the datasets are publicly available and can be easily identified.I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of specific datasets in the **results section**. The authors state that they used these 36 datasets for their experiments, but they do not provide detailed descriptions of each dataset. Instead, they refer to the UCI repository, which is a common source for datasets in machine learning.In the **references section**, I will check for any citations related to the UCI repository or any specific datasets mentioned. The UCI repository is a well-known source for datasets, and I will look for the citation that corresponds to the datasets used in the paper.The citation for the UCI repository is:> D. D. Lewis and W. A. Gale. *A sequential algorithm for training text classifiers*. In Proceedings of the 17th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval, pages 3a12, 1994. Springer-Verlag New York, Inc.Now, I will compile the dataset entries, including the UCI repository citation, as the paper does not provide specific dataset names. I will ensure to include the citation for the UCI repository as it is the source of the datasets used in the experiments.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the UCI repository as the source of the datasets.
