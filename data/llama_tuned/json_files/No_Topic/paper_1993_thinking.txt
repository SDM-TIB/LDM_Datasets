To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DSC-IIT ISM at WNUT-2020 Task 2: Detection of COVID-19 informative tweets using RoBERTa" by Sirigireddy Dhanalaxmi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a public dataset for their experiments, which suggests that a specific dataset will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **dataset section** (section 3) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:1. **Training Dataset**: This dataset consists of 7000 samples, with 330 samples in the informative class and 3374 samples in the uninformative class.2. **Validation Dataset**: This dataset contains 1000 samples, also with 330 samples in the informative class and 670 samples in the uninformative class.3. **Test Dataset**: The test dataset consists of 12000 tweets, with 2000 tweets labeled as informative and 10000 labeled as uninformative.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, as they are part of the WNUT-2020 Task 2, which is a shared task rather than a standalone dataset. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are derived from the WNUT-2020 Task 2, but I will not be able to provide full citations for them as they are not explicitly listed in the references.Since the datasets are part of a shared task, I will summarize the information as follows:- **Dataset 1**: Training Dataset - 7000 samples (330 informative, 3374 uninformative)- **Dataset 2**: Validation Dataset - 1000 samples (330 informative, 670 uninformative)- **Dataset 3**: Test Dataset - 12000 tweets (2000 informative, 10000 uninformative)Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I clearly indicate the datasets and their characteristics.
