To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalizing A Person Retrieval Model Hetero- and Homogeneously" by Zhun Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:1. **Market-1501**: This dataset contains 32,668 labeled images of 1,501 identities collected from 6 cameras. The authors specify that 12,936 images from 751 identities are used for training, and 19,732 images from 750 identities plus some distractors form the gallery/database.2. **DukeMTMC-reID**: This dataset has 8 cameras and 36,411 labeled images belonging to 1,404 identities. The authors describe the dataset's structure, including the division of images into training, query, and gallery sets.3. **CUHK03**: This dataset consists of 14,096 images of 1,467 identities, with each identity captured from two cameras. The authors note that the dataset does not have camera labels, which affects the training process.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For **Market-1501**, the citation is: > Zheng, L., Shen, L., Tian, L., Wang, S., Wang, J., Tian, Q. *Scalable person re-identiication: A benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1-9, 2015.- For **DukeMTMC-reID**, the citation is: > Zheng, Z., Zheng, L., Yang, Y. *Unlabeled samples generated by GAN improve the person re-identiication baseline in vitro*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1-9, 2017.- For **CUHK03**, the citation is: > Li, W., Zhao, R., Xiao, T., Wang, X. *DeepReID: Deep filter pairing neural network for person re-identiication*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1-9, 2014.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
