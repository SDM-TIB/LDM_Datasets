To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lightweight Word-Level Confidence Estimation for Neural Interactive Translation Prediction" by Rebecca Knowles and Philipp Koehn, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of neural models for interactive translation prediction, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of machine translation.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3.1) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using **University of Edinburgh neural models from WMT 2016** for various language pairs and directions. This indicates that the WMT 2016 dataset is a key dataset used in their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors specify that they use the WMT 2016 test data for training and development, which consists of between 64,000 and 73,000 tokens. They also mention using WMT 2017 test data for evaluation, which further confirms the datasets used.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The WMT 2016 dataset is referenced as follows:- For **WMT 2016**, the citation is: > Rico Sennrich, Orhan Firat, Kyunghyun Cho, Alexandra Birch, Barry Haddow, Julian Hitschler, Marcin Junczys-Dowmunt, Samuel LA Aubli, Antonio Valerio Miceli Barone, Jozef Mokry, and Maria Nadejde. *Nematus: a toolkit for neural machine translation*. In Proceedings of the Software Demonstrations of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 65a68, Valencia, Spain, 2017. Association for Computational Linguistics.Additionally, the authors refer to the **WMT 2017 test data**, which is also a dataset used in their experiments. The citation for this is:- For **WMT 2017**, the citation is: > OndË‡ej Bojar, Rajen Chatterjee, Christian Federmann, Yvette Graham, Barry Haddow, Shujian Huang, Matthias Huck, Philipp Koehn, Qun Liu, Varvara Logacheva, Christof Monz, Matteo Negri, Matt Post, Raphael Rubino, Lucia Specia, and Marco Turchi. *Findings of the 2017 conference*. In Proceedings of the Second Conference on Machine Translation, Volume 2: Shared Task Papers, pages 169a214, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2017. Association for Computational Linguistics.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
