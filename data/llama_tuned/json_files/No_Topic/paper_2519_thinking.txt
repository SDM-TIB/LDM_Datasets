To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Large Rated Lexicon with French Medical Words" by Natalia Grabar and Thierry Hamon, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a lexicon with French medical words, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to the annotation process.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for their work. The introduction discusses the challenges of medical terminology and the need for a lexicon, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.In the **methodology section**, I will look for any detailed descriptions of the datasets used for annotation. The authors mention that they used the **Snomed International** terminology in French, which is a significant dataset for medical terminology. They also describe the annotation process, which involves human annotators rating medical words, but they do not provide a specific dataset name for this process.I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors refer to any datasets used for evaluation or analysis. However, they primarily focus on the lexicon's structure and the annotation process rather than specific datasets.After reviewing the paper, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Snomed International** dataset. The citation is:> CEotA e, R. (1996). *RAdpertoire d'Anatomopathologie de la SNOMED internationale, v3.4*. UniversitA e de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QuA ebec.Now, I will summarize the findings:1. **Snomed International**: This dataset is used for medical terminology and is referenced in the paper as the source of the medical words for the lexicon. The citation is provided in the references section.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the citation into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant information and citations from the paper.
