To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PanoRecon: Real-Time Panoptic 3D Reconstruction from Monocular Video" by Dong Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **ScanNetV2**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, they explicitly mention **ScanNetV2** as the dataset for their experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its characteristics and the context in which it was used.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe **ScanNetV2** as consisting of 1613 scans across 807 distinct scenes, which includes RGB images, ground truth depths, camera poses, surface reconstructions, and instance-level semantic segmentations. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application in their research.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for **ScanNetV2**. The citation is as follows:> Angela Dai, Angel X Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nie√üner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 5828a5839, 2017.Since the paper primarily focuses on **ScanNetV2**, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
