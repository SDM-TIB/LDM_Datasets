To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GEPSA: A Tool for Monitoring Social Challenges in Digital Press" by IÃ±aki San Vicente et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the GEPSA tool and its application in monitoring social challenges, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **features sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of evidence-based diagnostics for social challenges and mention various studies related to social challenges like gender equality and immigration. However, they do not specify any datasets here either.In the **features section**, the authors describe the macro key indicators for monitoring social challenges, which suggests that they may have created or utilized specific datasets for training their models. I will look for any mention of datasets in this section.In the **system architecture and data visualization sections**, the authors describe the process of data collection and the creation of news datasets for training their models. They mention that they built two news datasets, one for Spanish and one for Basque, containing 156K and 300K classified news articles, respectively. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their analysis.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference several studies that may have provided the datasets used for training their models, such as the EIEC corpus and the CONLL2003 dataset. The EIEC corpus is cited as follows:- For the **EIEC corpus**, the citation is: > Alegria, I., Arregi, O., Balza, I., Ezeiza, N., Fernandez, I., & Urizar, R. (2004). *Design and development of a named entity recognizer for an agglutinative language*. In First International Joint Conference on NLP (IJCNLP-04). Workshop on Named Entity Recognition.After identifying the datasets, I will summarize the findings:1. **EIEC corpus**: A dataset used for named entity recognition in agglutinative languages.2. **CONLL2003 dataset**: A dataset for named entity recognition in English.3. **Spanish and Basque news datasets**: Two datasets containing classified news articles in Spanish and Basque, respectively, used for training the models.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
