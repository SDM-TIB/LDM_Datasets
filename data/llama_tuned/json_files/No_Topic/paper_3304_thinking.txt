To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Collectively Representing Semi-Structured Data from the Web" by Bhavana Dalvi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on publicly available semi-structured datasets from the Web, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods section**. In the introduction, the authors mention using publicly available semi-structured datasets from the Web, but they do not specify the exact datasets. I will need to look for more detailed information in the methods section.In the **methods section**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for evaluation:1. **Entity-Table Column Co-occurrence Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing edges that link entities with identifiers for table columns where the entities appeared.2. **Hyponym Concept Dataset**: This dataset is used to link entities with concepts, specifically for the purpose of automatic set instance acquisition.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:- For the **Entity-Table Column Co-occurrence Dataset**, the citation is: > Dalvi, B., Callan, J., & Cohen, W. (2012). WebSets: Extracting sets of entities from the web using unsupervised information extraction. In WSDM. datasets http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/wk/WebSets/:wsdm_2012_online/index.html.- For the **Hyponym Concept Dataset**, the citation is: > Dalvi, B., Cohen, W., & Callan, J. (2012). WebSets: Extracting sets of entities from the web using unsupervised information extraction. In WSDM. datasets http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/wk/WebSets/:wsdm_2012_online/index.html.Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
