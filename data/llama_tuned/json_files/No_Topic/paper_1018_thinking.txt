To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SemEval-2022 Task 7: Identifying Plausible Clarifications in Instructional Texts" by Daewook Kang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the task and the models used, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of instructional texts and the need for clarification, but they do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the experiments section, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation.In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they used the data and labels from **SemEval-2022 Task 7**. This indicates that this task is the primary dataset used in their research. I will need to find more details about this task, including its structure and the specific data it contains.The authors describe the dataset as consisting of article titles, subheadings, masked sentences, previous and follow-up context, and possible filler options with corresponding labels (Sub-task A) and ratings (Subtask B). This detailed description is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SemEval-2022 Task 7 dataset. The relevant citation is:- For **SemEval-2022 Task 7**, the citation is: > Michael Roth, Talita Anthonio, and Anna Sauer. *SemEval-2022 Task 7: Identifying plausible clarifications of implicit and underspecified phrases in instructional texts*. In Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022), pages 1-8, 2022.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent analysis or reporting.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that all relevant details are included, including the dataset name, description, and citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
