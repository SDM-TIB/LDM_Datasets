To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Recovery of Dense Correspondence and Cosegmentation in Two Images" by Tatsunori Taniai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a new dataset of 400 image pairs, which suggests that a specific dataset is being introduced.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. They mention three groups of datasets: FG3D, JODS, and PASCAL. I will extract details about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about each dataset:1. **FG3D**: This dataset contains 195 image pairs of vehicles.2. **JODS**: This dataset includes 81 image pairs of airplanes, horses, and cars.3. **PASCAL**: This dataset consists of 124 image pairs of bicycles, motorbikes, buses, cars, and trains.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **FG3D**, the citation is: > Y.-L. Lin, V. I. Morariu, W. Hsu, and L. S. Davis. *Jointly optimizing 3D model fitting and fine-grained classification*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.- For **JODS**, the citation is: > M. Rubinstein, A. Joulin, J. Kopf, and C. Liu. *Unsupervised joint object discovery and segmentation in internet images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2013.- For **PASCAL**, the citation is: > B. Hariharan, P. Arbelaez, L. Bourdev, S. Maji, and J. Malik. *Semantic contours from inverse detectors*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2011.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
