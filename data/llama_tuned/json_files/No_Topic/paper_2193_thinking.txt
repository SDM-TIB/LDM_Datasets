To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiaHClust: an iterative hierarchical clustering approach for identifying stages in language change" by Christin SchAtzle and Hannah Booth, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a new approach for periodization in language change, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, particularly in the context of syntactic change in Icelandic.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets or corpora used for their analysis. The introduction discusses the challenges of traditional periodization methods and hints at the use of corpus data, but I need to look for specific names.In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their approach and mention the **Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus (IcePaHC)**, which is a key dataset for their study. They explain that this corpus is a Penn-style treebank that contains approximately 1,000,000 words from 61 text extracts spanning 10 centuries, which is crucial for their analysis.I will also check the **case study section** to confirm the dataset's relevance and details. The authors provide a description of how they extracted syntactic vectors from IcePaHC, which reinforces its importance in their research.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the IcePaHC dataset. The citation is as follows:> Joel C. Wallenberg, Anton Karl Ingason, Einar Freyr SigurAsson, and EirAkur RAgnvaldsson. *Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus (IcePaHC), version 0.9*. http://linguist.is/icelandic_treebank.With this information, I have identified the dataset used in the paper, which is the **Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus (IcePaHC)**. I will now compile this dataset entry into the required format for further processing or review.
