To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assessing the Performance of Automatic Speech Recognition Systems When Used by Native and Non-Native Speakers of Three Major Languages in Dictation Workflows" by Juli√°n Zapata, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of ASR systems in dictation workflows, which suggests that datasets related to speech recognition and dictation may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the experimental setup. They mention that the experiment was performed with a sample of speakers of three major languages, including English, French, and Spanish. This indicates that the datasets may include linguistic data or speech samples from these languages.In the **results section**, the authors describe the tasks performed and the performance metrics used, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. However, they do refer to the use of a commercial ASR system and a PC-based system, which may imply the use of datasets related to speech recognition or linguistic data.I will also check the **references section** to find any citations that might correspond to datasets or resources used in the study. The references include various papers related to ASR and translation, but they do not explicitly mention datasets.Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, I will summarize the findings:1. **Speech Recognition Datasets**: The paper does not provide a specific dataset name, but it mentions the use of ASR systems and linguistic profiles of speakers from different languages.2. **Linguistic Data**: The authors refer to the use of texts for dictation tasks, but they do not specify a particular dataset or source for these texts.Finally, I will note that the paper does not provide a formal dataset citation, as it appears to rely on existing ASR systems and linguistic data rather than a specific dataset.After reviewing the paper, I will conclude that while the paper discusses the performance of ASR systems, it does not provide specific datasets for extraction. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none mentioned in the text.
