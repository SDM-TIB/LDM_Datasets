To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Invariant Learning for Domain Generalization" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on four widely used cross-domain visual recognition benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4.1), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:1. **PACS Dataset**: This dataset consists of 9,991 images across seven classes from four domains: photo, art-painting, cartoon, and sketch. The authors follow a leave-one-out protocol for training and testing.2. **Office-Home Dataset**: This dataset contains approximately 15,500 images across 65 categories for object recognition in office and home environments. The authors use the same experimental protocol as for PACS.3. **Rotated MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is used to evaluate domain generalization, specifically for the Rotated MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. The authors randomly select a subset of images from MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, which are rotated to create five source domains and two target domains.4. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**: Similar to Rotated MNIST, this dataset is used for domain generalization, with a subset of images selected and rotated to create source and target domains.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **PACS Dataset**, the citation is: > Haoliang Li, Sinno Jialin Pan, Shiqi Wang, and Alex C Kot. *Domain generalization with adversarial feature learning*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 5400a5409, 2018.- For **Office-Home Dataset**, the citation is: > Hemanth Venkateswara, Jose Eusebio, Shayok Chakraborty, and Sethuraman Panchanathan. *Deep hashing network for unsupervised domain adaptation*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 5018a5027, 2017.- For **Rotated MNIST Dataset**, the citation is: > Vihari Piratla, Praneeth Netrapalli, and Sunita Sarawagi. *Efficient domain generalization via common-specific low-rank decomposition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.12815, 2020.- For **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**, the citation is: > Vihari Piratla, Praneeth Netrapalli, and Sunita Sarawagi. *Efficient domain generalization via common-specific low-rank decomposition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.12815, 2020.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
