To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Offensive language detection for Dravidian Code-mixed YouTube comments" by Judith Jeyafreeda and Andrew Normandie, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper focuses on detecting offensive language in YouTube comments from Dravidian languages, which suggests that datasets related to these languages may be involved.Next, I will examine the **data section** (section 3) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used. Here, the authors mention three datasets for the Dravidian languages of Tamil, Malayalam, and Kannada. The datasets are described as follows:1. **Tamil Code-mixed YouTube comments**: This dataset contains 35,139 instances in the train set, 4,388 instances in the dev set, and 4,392 instances in the test set.2. **Malayalam Code-mixed YouTube comments**: This dataset consists of 16,010 instances in the train set, 1,999 instances in the dev set, and 2,001 instances in the test set.3. **Kannada Code-mixed YouTube comments**: This dataset includes 6,216 instances in the train set, 776 instances in the dev set, and 778 instances in the test set.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For the **Tamil Code-mixed YouTube comments**, the citation is: > Bharathi Raja Chakravarthi, Navya Jose, Shardul Suryawanshi, Elizabeth Sherly, and John Philip McCrae. *A sentiment analysis dataset for code-mixed Tamil-English*. In Proceedings of the 1st Joint Workshop on Spoken Language Technologies for Under-resourced languages (SLTU) and Collaboration and Computing for Under-Resourced Languages (CCURL), pages 177a184, Marseille, France, 2020.- For the **Malayalam Code-mixed YouTube comments**, the citation is: > Bharathi Raja Chakravarthi, Navya Jose, Shardul Suryawanshi, Elizabeth Sherly, and John Philip McCrae. *A sentiment analysis dataset for code-mixed Malayalam-English*. In Proceedings of the 1st Joint Workshop on Spoken Language Technologies for Under-resourced languages (SLTU) and Collaboration and Computing for Under-Resourced Languages (CCURL), pages 177a184, Marseille, France, 2020.- For the **Kannada Code-mixed YouTube comments**, the citation is: > Adeep Hande, Ruba Priyadharshini, and Bharathi Raja Chakravarthi. *CMD: KannadaChakravarthi for sentiment analysis and CodeMixed dataset for offensive language detection*. In Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Computational Modeling of Peopleas Opinions, Personality, and Emotionas in Social Media, pages 54a63, Barcelona, Spain, 2020.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
