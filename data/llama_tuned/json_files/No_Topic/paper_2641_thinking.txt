To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lingua Custodiaas participation at the WMT 2021 Machine Translation using Terminologies" by Melissa Ailem, Jinghsu Liu, and Raheel Qader, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of terminologies in machine translation, which suggests that datasets related to these terminologies might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **data section** (section 3) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the following datasets:1. **Training Data Selection**: The authors specify that they rely on monolingual data for training, including: - **News Crawl 2020**: A dataset containing news articles in multiple languages. - **NCv16**: A dataset for biomedical terminology. - **Parallel en-fr**: A bilingual dataset for English-French translation. - **Parallel en-ru**: A bilingual dataset for English-Russian translation. - **Parallel en-zh**: A bilingual dataset for English-Chinese translation. - **News Commentary**: A dataset for news articles in Russian. - **Wikititles**: A dataset for Wikipedia titles in Russian. - **ParaCrawl**: A dataset for parallel corpora in Russian. - **UN, Common Crawl, Europarl v10, EMEA, Medline Titles, Medline abstracts**: Various datasets for biomedical terminology in English and Russian.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:- For **News Crawl 2020**, the citation is: > "News Crawl 2020".- For **NCv16**, the citation is: > "NCv16".- For **Parallel en-fr**, the citation is: > "Parallel en-fr".- For **Parallel en-ru**, the citation is: > "Parallel en-ru".- For **Parallel en-zh**, the citation is: > "Parallel en-zh".- For **News Commentary**, the citation is: > "News Commentary".- For **Wikititles**, the citation is: > "Wikititles".- For **ParaCrawl**, the citation is: > "ParaCrawl".- For **UN, Common Crawl, Europarl v10, EMEA, Medline Titles, Medline abstracts**, the citation is: > "UN, Common Crawl, Europarl v10, EMEA, Medline Titles, Medline abstracts".Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
