To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Inference on Deep Neural Networks by Dynamic Representations and Decision Gates" by Mohammad Saeed Shaiee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **CIFAR10 dataset**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned. The introduction discusses the challenges of deep neural networks and mentions the use of the **CIFAR10 dataset** for their experiments, confirming its significance.In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their experimental setup, which includes training and testing their proposed method on the **CIFAR10 dataset**. This reinforces the dataset's importance in their research.Now, I will check the **results section** to confirm the dataset's usage and any additional details provided. The authors mention that their experiments were conducted on the **CIFAR10 dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for image classification tasks.In the **references section**, I will look for the full citation of the **CIFAR10 dataset**. The citation is typically found in the references, and for CIFAR10, it is:> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, 2009. https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.htmlSince the paper primarily focuses on the **CIFAR10 dataset**, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset.After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **CIFAR10 dataset**, ensuring that the citation is included accurately. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
