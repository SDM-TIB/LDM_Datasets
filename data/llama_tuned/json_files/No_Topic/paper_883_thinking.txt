To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Argument-Level Interactions for Persuasion Comments Evaluation using Co-attention Model" by Lu Ji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a publicly available dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **datasets section**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of evaluating argumentative comments and mention that their datasets are collected from an online forum. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.In the **datasets section**, the authors explicitly state that their datasets are collected from the /r/ChangeMyView subreddit (CMV). They provide details about the dataset, including the number of training and testing instances, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.I will also look for the **experiments section** to confirm the use of the dataset in their evaluations. The authors mention that they used the same dataset as Tan et al. (2016) for evaluation, which is a key piece of information.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference Tan et al. (2016) as the source of the dataset, which is a well-known dataset in the field of argumentation evaluation. The citation for this dataset is:- For the dataset used in this paper, the citation is: > Chenhao Tan, Vlad Niculae, Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, and Lillian Lee. *Winning arguments: Interaction dynamics and persuasion strategies in good-faith online discussions*. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web (ICWW), pages 613a624, 2016.With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:1. **CMV Dataset**: This dataset is collected from the /r/ChangeMyView subreddit, containing 3,456 training instances and 807 testing instances, where each instance includes an original post with one positive and one negative reply. The dataset is used for evaluating the persuasiveness of replies in online discussions.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
