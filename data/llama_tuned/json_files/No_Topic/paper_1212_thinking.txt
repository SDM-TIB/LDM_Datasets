To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Factoring Ambiguity out of the Prediction of Compositionality for German Multi-Word Expressions" by Stefan Bott and Sabine Schulte im Walde, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the prediction of compositionality for German multi-word expressions, which suggests that datasets related to these expressions might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiment setup section**. Here, the authors mention the use of the **SdeWaC corpus** for feature extraction. This is a significant dataset for their experiments, as it is described as a corpus of parsable sentences from the web, which is crucial for their analysis.In the **gold standards section**, the authors list two gold standards: **GS-NN** and **GS-PV**. These are specific datasets used for evaluating the compositionality of German noun-noun compounds and particle verbs, respectively. I will need to find their full citations to provide complete references.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:1. For the **SdeWaC corpus**, the citation is: > Gertrud FäA and Kerstin Eckart. *SdeWaC a corpus of parsable sentences from the web*. In Proceedings of the International Conference of the German Society for Computational Linguistics and Language Technology, pages 61a68, Darmstadt, Germany, 2013.2. For the **GS-NN gold standard**, the citation is: > Sabine Schulte im Walde, Anna Hätty, and Stefan Bott. *Ghost-NN: A representative gold standard of German noun-noun compounds*. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC'16), pages 2285a2292, Portoroz, Slovenia, 2016.3. For the **GS-PV gold standard**, the citation is: > Stefan Bott and Sabine Schulte im Walde. *Ghost-PV: A representative gold standard of German particle verbs*. In Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of the Lexicon (CogALex - V), pages 125a133, Osaka, Japan, 2016.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
