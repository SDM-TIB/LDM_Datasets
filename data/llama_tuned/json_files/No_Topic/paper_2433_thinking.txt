To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-shot Regression via Learned Basis Functions" by Yi Loo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a few-shot learning model for regression tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, particularly in the context of evaluating the proposed method.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets used for their experiments. The introduction discusses various regression tasks but does not provide explicit dataset names.In the **experiments section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors mention three specific regression tasks: sinusoidal regression, 1D heat equation, and 2D Gaussian distribution tasks. I will need to find the corresponding datasets for these tasks.In the **B. DATASET AND TRAINING DETAILS section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for each task:1. **Sinusoidal Regression**: The authors describe the dataset as being defined by the function y(x) = Asin(Ix + b) +, where parameters are sampled uniformly from specified ranges. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name.2. **1D Heat Equation**: The authors describe the dataset as modeling the temperature distribution along a 1D rod, with parameters set to achieve equilibrium throughout the rod. Again, no specific dataset name is provided.3. **2D Gaussian Distribution**: Similar to the sinusoidal task, the authors describe the dataset as modeling a 2D Gaussian distribution, but they do not provide a specific dataset name.Since the paper does not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets, I will check the **References section** for any citations that might correspond to the datasets used. However, the references primarily consist of foundational works in the field of few-shot learning and meta-learning, without specific dataset citations.After reviewing the paper, it appears that the datasets are either original datasets created for the experiments or variations of well-known datasets adapted for the specific tasks. Therefore, I will note that while the paper does not provide specific dataset names, it describes the datasets in detail for each task.Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information provided in the paper, focusing on the descriptions and the context in which they were used. Since no specific dataset names are provided, I will summarize the datasets as follows:- **Sinusoidal Regression Dataset**: A dataset defined by the function y(x) = Asin(Ix + b) +, with parameters sampled from specified ranges.- **1D Heat Equation Dataset**: A dataset modeling the temperature distribution along a 1D rod, with parameters set to achieve equilibrium.- **2D Gaussian Distribution Dataset**: A dataset modeling a 2D Gaussian distribution, with parameters set to achieve a specific distribution.Finally, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the descriptions and the context in which they were used in the experiments.
