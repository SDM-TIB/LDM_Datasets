To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-tuning of models for low-resource multilingual epidemic surveillance" by Stephen Mutuvi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of epidemic surveillance in low-resource languages, which suggests that datasets related to epidemics might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods** sections, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. In the **methods section**, the authors mention using the **DANIEL dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is specifically designed for multilingual epidemic surveillance, which is a strong indication that it is a key dataset for their research.I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the dataset's usage and any additional datasets that may be referenced. The authors describe the **DANIEL dataset** in detail, indicating that it contains articles in multiple languages, which is crucial for their multilingual approach.Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the **DANIEL dataset**. The citation is as follows:> Mutuvi, S., Boros, E., Doucet, A., Lejeune, G., Jatowt, A., & Odeo, M. (2021). Token-level multilingual epidemic dataset for event extraction. In International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries, p. 55a59: Springer.With this information, I have identified the dataset and its citation. I will now compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the dataset and its reference from the paper.
