To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Scalable aa-constrained Near-lossless Image Compression via Joint Lossy Image and Residual Compression" by Yuanchao Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a near-lossless image compression framework, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on four datasets:1. **Kodak dataset**: This dataset consists of 24 uncompressed 768 Ã— 512 color images.2. **DIV2K high resolution validation dataset**: This dataset contains 100 2K resolution color images.3. **CLIC professional validation dataset (CLIC.p)**: This dataset consists of 41 color images taken by professional photographers.4. **CLIC mobile validation dataset (CLIC.m)**: This dataset includes 61 color images taken using mobile phones.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Kodak dataset**, the citation is: > Eastman Kodak. *Kodak lossless true color image suite (pcd0992)*, 1993. http://r0k.us/graphics/kodak/- For the **DIV2K dataset**, the citation is: > Eirikur Agustsson and Radu Timofte. *NTIRE 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: dataset and study*. In IEEE Conf. Comput. Vis. Pattern Recog. Worksh., July 2017.- For the **CLIC.p dataset**, the citation is: > Workshop and Challenge on Learned Image Compression. https://www.compression.cc/challenge/- For the **CLIC.m dataset**, the citation is the same as CLIC.p since they are part of the same challenge.Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution and reference in future work. This structured approach will help in organizing the information effectively for further analysis or application.
