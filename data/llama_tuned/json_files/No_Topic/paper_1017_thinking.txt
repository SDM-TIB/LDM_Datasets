To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A multi-layer annotation of the R. GVEDA" by Oliver Hellwig et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the project, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.In the **introduction**, the authors mention the importance of the R. GVEDA and the need for annotated corpora in Sanskrit linguistics. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets at this point.Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors describe the annotation process. They mention the use of a morpho-lexical tagger and the creation of a verb-argument annotation. This suggests that there may be datasets related to these annotations, but I need to look for specific names.In the **results section**, the authors discuss the creation of a multi-layer annotated corpus of Vedic Sanskrit, which implies that they may have used specific datasets for their annotations. However, they do not provide explicit names of datasets here either.I will also check the **references section** to find any citations that might correspond to the datasets used. The references include various works related to Sanskrit linguistics and computational linguistics, but they do not explicitly mention datasets in the context of the R. GVEDA annotation.After reviewing the entire paper, I find that the authors reference the following datasets:- **R. GVEDA**: This is the primary dataset mentioned in the paper, which is a fundamental Sanskrit text used for annotation. The authors describe the creation of a multi-layer annotated corpus based on this text, but they do not provide a specific citation for the R. GVEDA itself, as it is a well-known text in the field of Sanskrit studies. However, I can cite the original publication of the R. GVEDA:- **R. GVEDA**: > van Nooten, B., & Holland, G. (1994). *Rig Veda: A Metrically Restored Text with an Introduction and Notes*. Harvard Oriental Series. Harvard University Press.Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the R. GVEDA, ensuring to include the full citation as it is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper. This will provide a clear and accurate representation of the dataset used in the research.
