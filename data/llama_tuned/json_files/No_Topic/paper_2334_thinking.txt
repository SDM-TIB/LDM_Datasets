To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Sentential Patterns of Various Rhetoric Moves for Assisted Academic Writing" by Jim Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a system for extracting rhetorical patterns from academic writing, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets used for their research. The introduction references various studies and methodologies but does not explicitly name any datasets.In the **methods section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors mention using the **Citeseerx corpus** as a source for extracting sentential patterns, which is a significant dataset in the context of their research. However, I need to confirm if there are any other datasets mentioned.I will also check the **evaluation section** to see if the authors provide additional datasets used for testing their method. They mention using the **Argumentative Zoning corpus** for annotation, which is another dataset relevant to their work.Now, I will consult the **references section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **Citeseerx corpus**, the citation is: > Teufel, Simone. *Argumentative Zoning: Information Extraction from Scientific Text*. Diss. University of Edinburgh, 2000.2. For the **Argumentative Zoning corpus**, the citation is: > Teufel, Simone. *The Structure of Scientific Articles: Applications to Citation Indexing and Summarization*. Center for the Study of Language and Information, 2010.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
