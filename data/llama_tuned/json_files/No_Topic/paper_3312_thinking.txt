To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Learning of Motion-Informed Latent Representations" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **Objectron and UCF101 datasets** for their experiments, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their research.Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically the subsection titled **3.3 Studied Video Datasets**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:1. **Objectron**: This dataset contains 14,819 videos annotated with 3D bounding boxes over unique objects, split into nine categories. It is designed for 3D object detection and localization tasks.2. **UCF101**: This dataset consists of 13,320 videos annotated with 101 action labels, featuring a diverse range of video content and recording settings. The action labels are grouped into five types, including human-object interactions and body-motion only.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For **Objectron**, the citation is: > Adel Ahmadyan, Liangkai Zhang, Jianing Wei, Artsiom Ablavatski, and Matthias Grundmann. *Objectron: A large scale dataset of object-centric videos in the wild with pose annotations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.09988, 2020.- For **UCF101**, the citation is: > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
