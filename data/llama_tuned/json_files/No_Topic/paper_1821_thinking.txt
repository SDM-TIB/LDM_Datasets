To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TAC at SemEval-2020 Task 12: Ensembling Approach for Multilingual Offensive Language Identification in Social Media" by Talha Anwar and Omer Beg, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of offensive language detection in multiple languages, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled **3.1 Dataset**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets for different languages:1. **OLID Dataset**: This dataset is used for the English language task and is part of the SemEval 2020 task. It contains offensive and non-offensive tweets.2. **SOLID Dataset**: This dataset is also used for the English language task and is part of the SemEval 2020 task. It is a semi-supervised dataset for offensive language identification.3. **Arabic Language Dataset**: This dataset is used for the Arabic language task and is part of the SemEval 2020 task. It contains offensive and non-offensive tweets.4. **Turkish Language Dataset**: This dataset is used for the Turkish language task and is part of the SemEval 2020 task. It contains offensive and non-offensive tweets.5. **Danish Language Dataset**: This dataset is used for the Danish language task and is part of the SemEval 2020 task. It contains offensive and non-offensive tweets.6. **Greek Language Dataset**: This dataset is used for the Greek language task and is part of the SemEval 2020 task. It contains offensive and non-offensive tweets.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:- For the **OLID Dataset**, the citation is: > Marcos Zampieri, Shervin Malmasi, Preslav Nakov, Sara Rosenthal, Noura Farra, and Ritesh Kumar. *Predicting the Type and Target of Offensive Posts in Social Media*. In Proceedings of NAACL, 2019.- For the **SOLID Dataset**, the citation is: > Sara Rosenthal, Pepa Atanasova, Georgi Karadzhov, Marcos Zampieri, and Preslav Nakov. *A large-scale semi-supervised dataset for offensive language identification*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.14454, 2020.- For the **Arabic Language Dataset**, the citation is: > Hamdy Mubarak, Ammar Rashed, Kareem Darwish, Younes Samih, and Ahmed Abdelali. *Arabic offensive language on Twitter: Analysis and experiments*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.02192, 2020.- For the **Turkish Language Dataset**, the citation is: > CA Ögreç A Öltekin. *A corpus of Turkish offensive language on social media*. In Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, 2020.- For the **Danish Language Dataset**, the citation is: > Gudbjartur Ingi Sigurbergsson and Leon Derczynski. *Offensive Language and Hate Speech Detection for Danish*. In Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, 2020.- For the **Greek Language Dataset**, the citation is: > Zeses Pitenis, Marcos Zampieri, and Tharindu Ranasinghe. *Offensive Language Identification in Greek*. In Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, 2020.- For the **English Language Dataset**, the citation is: > Sara Rosenthal, Pepa Atanasova, Georgi Karadzhov, Marcos Zampieri, and Preslav Nakov. *A large-scale semi-supervised dataset for offensive language identification*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.14454, 2020.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
