To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WMDO: Fluency-based Word Moveras Distance for Machine Translation Evaluation" by Julian Chow, Pranava Madhyastha, and Lucia Specia, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed metric, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly the subsection titled **3.1 Datasets**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they used the **WMT17 segment-level into-English datasets** for their evaluations. This is a clear indication of the datasets used.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more details about the WMT17 datasets, indicating that they contain data from seven different source languages, with 560 different texts each, including reference translations and machine translations. This confirms the datasets used in their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WMT17 datasets. The citation for the WMT17 datasets is:- For **WMT17 datasets**, the citation is: > Ondrej Bojar, Yvette Graham, and Amir Kamran. *Results of the wmt17 metrics shared task*. Proceedings of the Second Conference on Machine Translation, page 489513, 2017.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the WMT17 datasets.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and citation in the required format.
