To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Energy Disaggregation via Discriminative Sparse Coding" by J. Zico Kolter et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the energy disaggregation task and mentions a large-scale dataset, which indicates that a dataset is likely included.Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 3) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using a dataset provided by **Plugwise**, a European manufacturer of plug-level monitoring devices. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I need to gather more details about it.In the **experimental results section**, the authors describe the dataset as containing hourly energy readings from 10,165 devices in 590 homes, collected over more than two years. They also mention that the dataset does not contain whole-home energy readings, so they approximate the home's energy usage based on the devices' readings.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Plugwise dataset. The citation is as follows:> Plugwise. *Plugwise Energy Data Set*. Available at: https://www.plugwise.com/en/energy-data-set/.Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and citation.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Plugwise dataset, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
