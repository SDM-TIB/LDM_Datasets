To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PoissonaGamma Dynamical Systems" by Aaron Schein et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their model's performance on various real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:1. **Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT)**: This dataset consists of country-to-country interaction events extracted from news corpora, with five count matrices created for each year from 2001 to 2005.2. **Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS)**: This dataset is also derived from news corpora and contains fewer events compared to GDELT, with three count matrices created for the years 2001-2003, 2004-2006, and 2007-2009.3. **State-of-the-Union transcripts (SOTU)**: This dataset includes the text of annual SOTU speech transcripts from 1790 to 2014, resulting in a single count matrix with 225 time steps.4. **DBLP conference abstracts**: This dataset is a database of computer science research papers, specifically the subset used for evaluating the GP-DPFA model, which consists of a count matrix with 14 columns and 13,431 tokens.5. **NIPS corpus**: This dataset contains the text of every NIPS conference paper from 1987 to 2003, resulting in a single count matrix with one column per year.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For **GDELT**, the citation is: > GDELT. *Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone*. 2015.- For **ICEWS**, the citation is: > ICEWS. *Integrated Crisis Early Warning System*. 2015.- For **SOTU**, the citation is: > SOTU. *State-of-the-Union transcripts*. 2014.- For **DBLP**, the citation is: > DBLP. *DBLP conference abstracts*. 2015.- For **NIPS**, the citation is: > NIPS. *NIPS corpus*. 2015.Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
