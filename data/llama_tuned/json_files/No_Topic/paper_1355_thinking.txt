To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Query-Adaptive Late Fusion for Image Search and Person Re-identification" by Liang Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments are conducted on two image search datasets and one person re-identification dataset, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **datasets section**. In the introduction, the authors mention using two image search datasets and one person re-identification dataset, but I need to find the exact names and details.In the **datasets section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used:1. **Ukbench Dataset**: This dataset contains 10,200 images, with each image being used as a query, and it provides ground truth images with extensive variations.2. **Holidays Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,491 personal holiday pictures, with a total of 500 queries. It is evaluated using the Mean Average Precision (mAP) metric.3. **VIPeR Dataset**: This dataset is used for person re-identification and contains 632 persons, each with two images captured from two cameras, showcasing various viewing angles and poses.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Ukbench Dataset**, the citation is: > D. Niester and H. Stewenius. *Scalable recognition with a vocabulary tree*. In CVPR, 2006.- For the **Holidays Dataset**, the citation is: > H. JÃ©gou, M. Douze, and C. Schmid. *Hamming embedding and weak geometric consistency for large scale image search*. In ECCV, 2008.- For the **VIPeR Dataset**, the citation is: > D. Gray, S. Brennan, and H. Tao. *Evaluating appearance models for recognition, reacquisition, and tracking*. In IEEE International workshop on performance evaluation of tracking and surveillance, 2007.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
