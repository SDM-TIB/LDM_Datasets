To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empirical Analysis of Noising Scheme based Synthetic Data Generation for Automatic Post-editing" by Hyeonseok Moon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of APE data generation and mentions the use of a parallel corpus, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they mention leveraging the **Korean-English (Ko-En) pair** for their experiments. They specify that they used a parallel corpus distributed by AIHub 2, which consists of 1.6 million sentence pairs from various domains.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the parallel corpus used. The authors reference the AIHub 2 dataset, which is crucial for the dataset extraction.Now, I will compile the dataset information, including the name, description, and citation. The dataset details are as follows:1. **Korean-English (Ko-En) parallel corpus**: - **Description**: This dataset consists of 1.6 million sentence pairs from six different domains, including colloquial, news, dialogue, cultural, ordinance, and official document. - **Citation**: Park, C., Shim, M., Eo, S., Lee, S., Seo, J., Moon, H., and Lim, H. (2021). Empirical analysis of Korean public AI hub parallel corpora and in-depth analysis using LIWC. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.15023.With this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Ko-En parallel corpus, ensuring to include the full citation as required.Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry in the specified format for further processing or review.
