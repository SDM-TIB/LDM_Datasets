To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning from Group Comparisons: Exploiting Higher Order Interactions" by Yao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their models on several E-sports datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two datasets:1. **Heroes of the Storm (HotS) Tournament Dataset**: This dataset includes match records from the Heroes of the Storm tournament, which is a multiplayer online battle arena game. The authors specify that they collected data from HotSlog for the years 2015 and 2016, indicating the source of the data.2. **Dota 2 Dataset**: This dataset consists of match data from Dota 2, focusing on a set of notable players and their match outcomes. The authors mention that they downloaded the data from OpenDota 3, which is a popular platform for Dota 2 matches.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Heroes of the Storm (HotS) Tournament Dataset**, the citation is: > Hotslog. *Heroes of the Storm Match Records*. Available at: https://www.hotslogs.com/Default- For the **Dota 2 Dataset**, the citation is: > OpenDota. *Dota 2 Match Data*. Available at: https://www.opendota.comAfter gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
