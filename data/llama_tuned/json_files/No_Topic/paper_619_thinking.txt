To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Applying Unsupervised Learning To Support Vector Space Model Based Speaking Assessment" by Lei Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of unsupervised learning for training reference vectors in a Vector Space Model (VSM) for speech assessment, which suggests that datasets related to speech responses are involved.Next, I will focus on the **data section** (Section 3) where the author describes the data used in the experiments. Here, the author mentions that the data was collected from the **Test Of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL R)**, which is a well-known English proficiency test. This indicates that the dataset is related to speech responses from test-takers.I will also check the **experiments section** to see if there are any additional datasets or details about the data collection process. The author provides a summary of the responses across 24 test items, including mean, standard deviation, and sample size, which further confirms the use of the TOEFL R dataset.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the TOEFL R dataset. The citation for the TOEFL R is typically:> International English Language Testing System (IELTS). *Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL R)*. Available at: https://www.ielts.org/test/TOEFL_R.htmlSince the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the TOEFL R dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the TOEFL R dataset, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
