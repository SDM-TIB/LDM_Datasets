To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multilingual Document Structure Extraction using Transfer Learning" by Frederic Haase and Steffen Kirchhoff, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in financial document structure extraction and mention the FinTOC-2020 shared task, which suggests that datasets related to this task may be involved. I will look for specific dataset names or descriptions.Next, I will focus on the **data section** (Section 3), where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets for the FinTOC-2020 shared task, which includes:1. **FinTOC-2020 Shared Task Dataset**: This dataset consists of 52 English and 47 French financial PDF documents, each annotated with text and depth for titles. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of pages, titles, and the depth of the table of contents (TOC) tree.2. **Training Data for Supervised Learning**: The authors describe a constructed dataset for supervised learning, where text blocks are mapped to ground truth titles, allowing for the training of a model to predict the depth of text blocks in the document structure hierarchy.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **FinTOC-2020 Shared Task Dataset**, the citation is: > Najah-Imane Bentabet, RÃ©mi Juge, Ismail El Maarouf, Virginie Mouilleron, Dialekti Valsamou-Stanislawski, and Mahmoud El-Haj. *The Financial Document Structure Extraction Shared task (FinToc 2020)*. In The 1st Joint Workshop on Financial Narrative Processing and MultiLing Financial Summarisation (FNP-FNS 2020, Barcelona, Spain, December 12, 2020).- For the **Training Data for Supervised Learning**, the citation is the same as the FinTOC-2020 shared task, as it is part of the same work.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
