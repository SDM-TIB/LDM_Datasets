To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature Space Perturbations Yield More Transferable Adversarial Examples" by Nathan Inkawhich et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses an adversarial attack method and mentions the use of datasets for testing, which indicates that datasets are present.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention using **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their research.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. 2009.- For **ImageNet**, the citation is: > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248a255, 2009.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
