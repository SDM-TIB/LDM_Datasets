To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Multi-Player Bandits - a Game of Thrones Approach" by Ilai Bistritz and Amir Leshem, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses a multi-player multi-armed bandit game, which suggests that datasets related to this game may be involved.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The authors mention the multi-player multi-armed bandit problem and its applications, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments or simulations.In the **experiments section**, I will focus on any subsections that detail the datasets used for simulations or evaluations. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets in use, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the research.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a complete picture of the datasets used in the research.If the paper includes a **results section**, I will look for any figures or tables that might summarize the datasets used, as this can provide additional context about the datasets' sizes, types, and how they were utilized in the experiments.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
