To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Randomized tests for high-dimensional regression: a more efficient and powerful solution" by Yue Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges in high-dimensional regression and hints at the use of synthetic data for evaluation, which suggests that datasets may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention conducting simulation studies using synthetic data, which indicates that they created their own datasets rather than using publicly available ones. They describe the process of generating synthetic data to test their proposed method, but they do not provide specific dataset names or citations.Since the paper does not reference any external datasets but rather generates synthetic data for their experiments, I will note that there are no publicly available datasets to extract. Instead, I will document the synthetic data generation process as the primary dataset used in their research.In conclusion, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets, noting that the paper relies on synthetic data generated for the experiments, and provide a citation for the paper itself as the source of the datasets used.
