To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-task learning for interpretable cause-of-death classification using key phrase prediction" by Serena Jeblee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a multi-task learning model for cause-of-death classification, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of verbal autopsy narratives.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for their experiments. The introduction provides context about verbal autopsies and the need for accurate cause-of-death classification, but it does not explicitly name datasets.In the **data section**, the authors describe their dataset in detail. They mention that their dataset consists of **12,045 records of adult deaths from the Million Death Study (MDS)**. This is a significant dataset for their research, and I need to gather more details about it.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Million Death Study. The authors reference the study as follows:- For the **Million Death Study**, the citation is: > Erica Westly. *Global health: One million deaths*. Nature, 504(7478):22a23, 2013.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the Million Death Study is the primary dataset used in their research.Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
