To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Stylistic and Content-based Classifier for Hyperpartisan News Detection" by Johannes Kiesel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors are working on a classification system for hyperpartisan news detection, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **dataset section**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the growing partisan divide and the need for a classification system, but they do not specify datasets yet. I will need to look deeper into the paper.In the **dataset section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for their experiments. They mention several datasets extracted from different American news sites, including:1. **Hyperpartisan News Detection Task Dataset**: This dataset consists of 600,000 articles for training, 150,000 articles for validation, and 645 training articles that were manually classified. The authors also mention that the validation sets are classified by publisher and individually by human classifiers.2. **Validation Sets**: The authors refer to two validation sets, one classified by publisher and one classified individually, but they do not provide specific details about these datasets in the text.3. **Ground Truth Data**: The authors mention that the ground truth data for the training and validation sets includes information about left-right bias of the publisher.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the following papers that describe the datasets:- For the **Hyperpartisan News Detection Task Dataset**, the citation is: > Johannes Kiesel, Maria Mestre, Rishabh Shukla, Emanuel Vincent, Payam Adineh, David Corney, Benno Stein, and Martin Potthast. *Semeval-2019 task 4: Hyperpartisan news detection*. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2019), pages 976a980, 2019.- For the **Validation Sets**, the citation is the same as above since it is part of the same task.- The ground truth data is also part of the same task, so it shares the same citation as the dataset.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
