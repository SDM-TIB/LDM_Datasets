To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Read and Comprehend by Gated-Attention Reader with More Belief" by Haohui Deng and Yik-Cheung Tama, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approaches on public test sets, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they state that they used **News stories from CNN and Daily Mail** and **Who Did What 2 (WD-W)** for their experiments. This is a clear indication of the datasets used.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets:1. **News stories from CNN and Daily Mail**: This dataset is derived from news articles, where a query is generated by replacing an entity in the summary with a placeholder, and entities are anonymized to reduce the impact of world knowledge and co-occurrence effects.2. **Who Did What 2 (WD-W)**: This dataset is constructed from the LD-C English Gigaword newswire corpus, where document pairs are chosen based on shared entities and one article is selected as the document, while another article forms a cloze-style query. The authors mention that they used two versions of the WDW dataset: a stricter version and a more noisy version, both sharing the same validation and test sets.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **News stories from CNN and Daily Mail**, the citation is: > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 1693a1701, 2015.- For **Who Did What 2 (WD-W)**, the citation is: > Takeshi Onishi, Hai Wang, Mohit Bansal, Kevin Gimpel, and David McAllester. *Who did what: A large-scale person-centered cloze dataset*. In Proceedings of the Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2016.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
