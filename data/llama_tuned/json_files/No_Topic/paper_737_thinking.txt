To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta Learning with Minimax Regularization" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses meta-learning and mentions experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments:1. **Mini-Imagenet**: This dataset is used for few-shot classification tasks. The authors describe it as a dataset sampled from ImageNet with 600 instances of 100 classes, where each image is resized to 84x84.2. **Omniglot**: This dataset is used for 20-way 1-shot classification. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of classes (1623) and the number of instances per class (20).3. **Sinusoids**: This dataset is used for few-shot regression tasks. The authors describe how the dataset is created, involving the regression of sine waves with varying amplitudes.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **Mini-Imagenet**, the citation is: > Sachin Ravi and Hugo Larochelle. *Optimization as a model for few-shot learning*. In ICLR, 2017.- For **Omniglot**, the citation is: > Brenden M Lake, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and Joshua B Tenenbaum. *Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction*. Science, 350(6266):1332a1338, 2015.- For **Sinusoids**, the citation is: > Mingzhang Yin, George Tucker, Mingyuan Zhou, Sergey Levine, and Chelsea Finn. *Meta-learning without memorization*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.03820, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
