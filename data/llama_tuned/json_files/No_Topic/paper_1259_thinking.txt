To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Authorship Identification for Literary Book Recommendations" by Haifa Alharthi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a system for recommending books based on authorship identification, which suggests that datasets related to authors and books may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Dataset and Preprocessing)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. Here, they describe the **LitRec dataset**, which contains data from 1,927 users who rated 3,710 literary works. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LitRec dataset. The citation is as follows:> Paula Cristina Vaz, David Martins de Matos, and Bruno Martins. *LitRec vs. MovieLens: A Comparative Study*. In Proceedings of the 12th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, JCDL '12, pages 387a388, New York, NY, USA, ACM, 2012.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and citation from the paper.
