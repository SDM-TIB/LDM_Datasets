To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Vector Representations for Unsupervised Automatic Short Answer Grading" by Oliver Adams et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method across two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **data section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:1. **CSDataset**: This dataset consists of 87 questions from an undergraduate computer science course, along with model answers and student answers. It is sourced from the work of Mohler et al. (2011).2. **RCDataset**: This dataset is a high-school English reading comprehension task for Class (Standard) XII students, containing 14 questions with recorded responses from 58 students. It is a new dataset introduced by the authors for future research.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **CSDataset**, the citation is: > Michael Mohler, Razvan C. Bunescu, and Rada Mihalcea. *Learning to grade short answer questions using semantic similarity measures and dependency graph alignments*. In ACL, pages 752a762, 2011.- For the **RCDataset**, since it is a new dataset introduced by the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation yet, but I will include a description of the dataset as it is presented in the paper.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the established dataset and a brief description for the new dataset, ready for further processing or review.
