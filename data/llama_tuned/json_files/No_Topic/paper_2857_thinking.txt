To extract datasets from the research paper titled "APLenty: annotation tool for creating high-quality datasets using active and proactive learning" by Minh-Quoc Nghiem and Sophia Ananiadou, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and case study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the APLenty tool but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and case study sections for more detailed information.In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of creating labeled datasets but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **case study section** where they describe a specific use case for their tool.Next, I will look for any datasets mentioned in the **case study**. The authors state that they used the **English CoNLL-2003 named entity dataset** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized.I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CoNLL-2003 dataset. The citation is as follows:> Erik F. Tjong Kim Sang and Fien De Meulder. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the seventh conference on Natural Language Learning at HLT-NAACL 2003-Volume 4, pages 142a147, 2003. Association for Computational Linguistics.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CoNLL-2003 dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the CoNLL-2003 dataset, ensuring that it is ready for any further processing or review.
