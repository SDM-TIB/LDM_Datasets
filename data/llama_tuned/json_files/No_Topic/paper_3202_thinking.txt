To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transition-Based Parsing for Deep Dependency Structures" by Xun Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of various grammatical formalisms and mentions experiments on different datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets for their experiments, including:1. **CCGBank**: A corpus of CCG derivations and dependency structures extracted from the Penn Treebank.2. **DeepBank**: A dynamically annotated treebank of the Wall Street Journal, providing annotations based on a large-scale linguistically precise HPSG grammar.3. **EnjuBank**: A corpus for semantic dependency parsing, converted from Penn Treebank annotations with linguistic heuristics.4. **GRBank**: A dataset for grammatical relation analysis in Chinese, derived from the Penn Treebank.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **CCGBank**, the citation is: > Julia Hockenmaier and Mark Steedman. *CCGBank: A corpus of CCG derivations and dependency structures extracted from the Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 33(3):355a396, 2007.- For **DeepBank**, the citation is: > Daniel Flickinger, Yi Zhang, and Valia Kordoni. *DeepBank: A dynamically annotated treebank of the Wall Street Journal*. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Workshop on Treebanks and Linguistic Theories, pages 85a96, 2012.- For **EnjuBank**, the citation is: > Yusuke Miyao, Takashi Ninomiya, and Junaichi Tsujii. *EnjuBank: A corpus for semantic dependency parsing*. In IJCNLP, pages 684a693, 2004.- For **GRBank**, the citation is: > Weiwei Sun, Yantao Du, Xin Kou, Shuoyang Ding, and Xiaojun Wan. *Grammatical relations in Chinese: GB-ground extraction and data-driven parsing*. In Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 446a456, 2014.Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their respective citations.
