To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Object-Oriented Representation for Efficient Reinforcement Learning" by Carlos Diuk, Andre Cohen, and Michael L. Littman, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of Object-Oriented MDPs (OO-MDPs) and mentions benchmark experiments in the **Taxi domain**, which suggests that this is a dataset used in their research.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their experiments. They explicitly mention using the **Taxi domain** for their experiments, which is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning. This indicates that the Taxi domain is a dataset used for evaluation.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the two versions of the Taxi domain: the original 5x5 grid version and the extended 10x10 grid version. They also mention using a modified Atari emulator for the **Pitfall videogame** for another set of experiments. This indicates that Pitfall is another dataset or environment used in their research.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **Taxi domain**, the citation is: > Dietterich, T. G. (2000). Hierarchical reinforcement learning with the MAXQ value function decomposition. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 13, 227a303.2. For the **Pitfall videogame**, the citation is: > Activision. (1982). *Pitfall*. Atari game console.3. Since the **Taxi domain** is a well-known benchmark, I will note that it is often referenced in reinforcement learning literature, but I will use the citation provided in the paper for clarity.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
