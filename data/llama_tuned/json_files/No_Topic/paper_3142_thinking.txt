To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Experiment in Integrating Sentiment Features for TechStock Prediction in Twitter" by Tien Thanh V u1,3 Shu Chang 2,3 Quang Tuy H a1 N iel C ollier 3, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used Twitter messages to predict stock prices, which suggests that there is a dataset related to Twitter data.Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically **section 3.1 (Data)**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention that they crawled 5,001,460 daily Tweets from Twitter using the Twitter online streaming API from April 1, 2011, to May 31, 2011. This indicates that the dataset consists of Twitter data, but I need to find the specific dataset name or identifier.In the **results section**, the authors provide details about the dataset, stating that they used 41 days of stock market open days of data, excluding weekends and public holidays. They also mention that the dataset includes Tweets related to four tech companies: Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN). This confirms that the dataset is derived from Twitter data, but I need to find the exact name or reference for it.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Twitter data. The authors reference the Twitter API and the online streaming API, but they do not provide a specific dataset name. However, they do mention that they downloaded daily Tweets using the Twitter online streaming API, which is a key detail for the dataset.The dataset can be described as follows:- **Twitter Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5,001,460 daily Tweets collected from Twitter from April 1, 2011, to May 31, 2011, focusing on the United States. The dataset includes Tweets related to four tech companies: Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN).The citation for the Twitter API is:> Twitter. *Twitter API Documentation*. Available at: https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis/streams/publicAfter gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
