To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion using Conditional Random Fields" by Irina Illina, Dominique Fohr, and Denis Jouvet, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, which suggests that datasets related to this task may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the challenges of phonetization for proper names. They reference the use of two pronunciation dictionaries, which indicates that datasets related to these dictionaries are likely included in their experiments.In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their approach and mention the use of two specific datasets:1. **Corpus BDLex**: This dataset is a lexical database that contains phonological and morphological information for French. It is used for training and testing their models.2. **Corpus du LORIA**: This dataset consists of 3,500 names of people, including their graphies, phonetic transcriptions, and information about their origin. It is also utilized for training and testing their models.Now, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used in the experiments. The authors mention that they validate their approach on these two datasets, which reinforces their importance in the study.Next, I will look at the **references section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For **Corpus BDLex**, the citation is: > De Calmes, M., & Perronnou, G. (1998). *BDLex: a lexicon for spoken and written French*. In LREC.- For **Corpus du LORIA**, the citation is: > Illina, I., Fohr, D., & Jouvet, D. (2011). *Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion using Conditional Random Fields*. In INTERSPEECH.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
