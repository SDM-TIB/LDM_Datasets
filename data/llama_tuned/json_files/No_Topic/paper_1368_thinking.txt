To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LEXFIT: Lexical Fine-Tuning of Pretrained Language Models" by Ivan Vulić et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of lexical fine-tuning and mentions various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention several datasets for their experiments, including:1. **Multi-SimLex**: A large-scale evaluation set of lexical semantic similarity in multiple languages.2. **SimVerb-3500**: A large-scale evaluation set of verb similarity.3. **SimLex-999**: A benchmark for evaluating semantic models with similarity estimation.4. **MUSE**: A dataset used for evaluating bilingual lexicon induction.5. **WordNet**: A lexical database used for lexical relations.6. **Rogetas Thesaurus**: A lexical database used for lexical relations.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **Multi-SimLex**, the citation is: > Ivan Vulić, Edoardo Maria Ponti, Robert Litschko, Goran Glavaš, and Anna Korhonen. *Multi-SimLex: A large-scale evaluation of multilingual and cross-lingual lexical semantic similarity*. Computational Linguistics, 41(4):665a695, 2015.- For **SimVerb-3500**, the citation is: > Daniela Gerz, Ivan Vulić, Felix Hill, Roi Reichart, and Anna Korhonen. *SimVerb-3500: A large-scale evaluation set of verb similarity*. In Proceedings of EMNLP 2016, pages 2173a2182.- For **SimLex-999**, the citation is: > Ira Leviant and Roi Reichart. *SimLex-999: Evaluating semantic models with (genuine) similarity estimation*. Computational Linguistics, 41(4):665a695, 2015.- For **MUSE**, the citation is: > Alexis Conneau, Kartikay Khandelwal, Naman Goyal, Vishrav Chaudhary, Guillaume Wenzek, Francisco Guzmán, Edouard Grave, Myle Ott, Luke Zettlemyer, and Veselin Stoyanov. *Unsupervised cross-lingual representation learning at scale*. In Proceedings of ACL 2020, pages 8440a8451.- For **WordNet**, the citation is: > Richard Beckwith, Christiane Fellbaum, Derek Gross, and George A. Miller. *WordNet: A lexical database organized on psycholinguistic principles*. Lexical acquisition: Exploiting on-line resources to build a lexicon, pages 211a231, 1991.- For **Rogetas Thesaurus**, the citation is: > Barbara Ann Kipfer. *Rogetas 21st Century Thesaurus (3rd Edition)*. Philip Lief Group, 2009.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
