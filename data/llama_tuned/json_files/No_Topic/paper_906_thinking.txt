To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Relationship between Visual Attributes and Convolutional Networks" by Victor Escorcia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the relationship between visual attributes and convolutional networks, which suggests that datasets related to these attributes might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for their experiments, specifically a subset of it called **ImageNet-Attribute**. This dataset is crucial for their analysis of visual attributes and convolutional networks.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset and the ImageNet-Attribute dataset. The relevant citations are:- For **ImageNet**, the citation is: > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.- For **ImageNet-Attribute**, the citation is: > O. Russakovsky and L. Fei-Fei. *Attribute learning in large-scale datasets*. In European Conference of Computer Vision (ECCV), International Workshop on Parts and Attributes, 2010.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
