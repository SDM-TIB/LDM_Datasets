To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cycle-Consistent GAN Front-End to Improve ASR Robustness to Perturbed Speech" by Sri Harsha Dumpala et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) for improving ASR robustness, which suggests that datasets related to speech recognition may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention using two spontaneous speech datasets:1. **AMI Meeting Corpus**: This dataset is used for training gender-dependent models and consists of dedicated annotations along with time-stamps for speech perturbed with emotions and voice-quality.2. **Buckeye Corpus of Conversational Speech**: This dataset also includes dedicated annotations and is used for training gender-dependent models, focusing on speech perturbed with emotions and voice-quality.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **AMI Meeting Corpus**, the citation is: > Iain McCowan, Jean Carletta, W Kraaij, S Ashby, S Bourban, M Flynn, M Guillemot, T Hain, J Kadlec, V Karaiskos, et al. *The AMI Meeting Corpus*. In Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Methods and Techniques in Behavioral Research, volume 88, page 100, 2005.- For the **Buckeye Corpus of Conversational Speech**, the citation is: > Mark A Pitt, Laura Dilley, Keith Johnson, Scott Kiesling, William Raymond, Elizabeth Hume, and Eric Fosler-Lussier. *Buckeye Corpus of Conversational Speech (2nd release)*. Available at: [www.buckeye corpus.osu.edu](http://www.buckeye corpus.osu.edu).Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution and reference in future work. This structured approach will help in accurately capturing the datasets used in the research paper.
