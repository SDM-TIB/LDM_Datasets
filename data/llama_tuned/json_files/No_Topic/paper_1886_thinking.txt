To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relative Instance Credibility Inference for Learning with Noisy Labels" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets and a real-world noisy dataset, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using the following datasets:1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.2. **CIFAR10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.3. **SVHN**: A dataset of 100,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, commonly used for image classification tasks.4. **ANIMAL10**: A real-world dataset published with mislabeling, containing 10,000 images of animals, which serves as a challenge for noisy label handling.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For **MNIST**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, LAon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278a2324, 1998.- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.- For **SVHN**, the citation is: > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. 2011.- For **ANIMAL10**, the citation is: > Hwanjun Song, Minseok Kim, and Jae-Gil Lee. *SELFIE: Refurbishing unclean samples for robust deep learning*. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 5907a5915. PMLR, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
