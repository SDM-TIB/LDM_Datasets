To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enriched Feature Guided Reinement Network for Object Detection" by Jing Nie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were performed on two benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they state that they performed experiments on **PASCAL VOC 2007** and **MS COCO**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their research.I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **PASCAL VOC 2007**, the citation is: > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303a338, 2010.- For **MS COCO**, the citation is: > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Doll√°r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision, 2014.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
