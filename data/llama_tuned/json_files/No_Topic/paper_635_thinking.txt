To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Flexible Spatio-Temporal Networks for Video Prediction" by Chaochao Lu and Michael Hirsch, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the framework for video prediction and mentions "extensive experiments on several challenging public datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:1. **UCF101**: This dataset contains 13,320 videos across 101 action categories, with an average length of 6.2 seconds.2. **Sports1m**: This dataset consists of 1 million YouTube clips, with a subset of 600 randomly selected videos used for training.3. **PROST**: This dataset is used for training the model and is derived from the PROST tracking dataset.4. **ViSOR**: Similar to PROST, this dataset is also used for training the model and is part of the same tracking framework as PROST.5. **Srivastava et al. (toy dataset)**: This dataset consists of 10,000 video sequences, each 20 frames long, containing two moving digits in a random direction and velocity.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For **UCF101**, the citation is: > K. Soomro, A. R. Zamir, and M. Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.- For **Sports1m**, the citation is: > A. Karpathy, G. Toderici, S. Shetty, T. Leung, R. Sukthankar, and L. Fei-Fei. *Large-scale video classification with convolutional neural networks*. In CVPR, 2014.- For **PROST**, the citation is: > J. Santner, C. Leistner, A. Saffari, T. Pock, and H. Bischof. *PROST: Parallel robust online simple tracking*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2010 IEEE Conference on, pages 723a730. IEEE, 2010.- For **ViSOR**, the citation is: > R. Vezzani and R. Cucchiara. *Video surveillance online repository (ViSOR): an integrated framework*. Multimedia Tools and Applications, 50(2):359a380, 2010.- For **Srivastava et al. (toy dataset)**, the citation is: > N. Srivastava, E. Mansimov, and R. Salakhutdinov. *Unsupervised learning of video representations using LSTMs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1502.04681, 2015.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
