To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NICTas Neural Machine Translation Systems for the WAT21 RestrictedTranslation Task" by Zuchao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the authors' system for the WAT21 restricted machine translation task, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention the WAT21 restricted translation task, which indicates that datasets are likely used for training and evaluation. I will look for specific dataset names or descriptions.In the **methods section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training their model. They state that they used the **ParaCrawl-v5.1** and **Wiki Titles v2** datasets for training. This is a clear indication of the datasets used.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For **ParaCrawl-v5.1**, the citation is: > Miquel Espl´a, Mikel Forcada, Gema Ram´A Arez-S´anchez, and Hieu Hoang. *ParaCrawl: Web-scale parallel corpora for the languages of the EU*. In Proceedings of Machine Translation Summit XVII Volume 2: Translator, Project and User Tracks, pages 118a119, Dublin, Ireland, 2019.2. For **Wiki Titles v2**, the citation is: > Miquel Espl´a, Mikel Forcada, Gema Ram´A Arez-S´anchez, and Hieu Hoang. *ParaCrawl: Web-scale parallel corpora for the languages of the EU*. In Proceedings of Machine Translation Summit XVII Volume 2: Translator, Project and User Tracks, pages 118a119, Dublin, Ireland, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
