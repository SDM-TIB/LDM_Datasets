To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Document Representations for Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval in Low-Resource Settings" by Mahsa Yarmohammadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three challenging collections, which suggests that specific datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide any names or details about the datasets. The introduction mentions three collections consisting of Somali, Swahili, and Tagalog speech/text documents, which are used for cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) tasks. This is a strong indication that these collections are datasets.I will then examine the **data section** (section 5) to gather more detailed information about the datasets. Here, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments, including:1. **OpenCLIR Evaluation**: This dataset consists of Somali, Swahili, and Tagalog speech and text documents, with a total of 838,813 documents and 442,547 queries.2. **ASR and MT Data**: The authors mention using a train-a and tune-a data for training ASR systems, which is a dataset for acoustic model training. The citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is referenced as part of the IARPA MATERIAL project.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenCLIR Evaluation dataset. The relevant citation is:- For **OpenCLIR Evaluation**, the citation is: > OpenCLIR Evaluation. 2018. https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/openclir-evaluation.Since the ASR and MT Data are part of the IARPA MATERIAL project, I will note that the citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is associated with the project.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
