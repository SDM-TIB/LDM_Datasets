To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Crowdsourced Corpus of Multiple Judgments and Disagreement on Anaphoric Interpretation" by Massimo Poesio et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper presents a crowdsourced corpus for anaphoric information, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets for anaphora resolution. They mention several datasets, including ONTONOTES, PRECO, ARRAU, and the newly introduced PRECO corpus. This is a good indication that these datasets are central to their research.In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the collection process and the types of judgments collected, which further confirms the datasets used. They mention the Phrase Detectives corpus, which is a crowdsourced dataset created through their game-with-a-purpose approach. This section provides detailed information about the datasets, including their size and the types of annotations.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.The datasets identified are:1. **ONTONOTES**: A widely used dataset for anaphora resolution, containing documents in multiple languages. Citation: > Sameer Pradhan, Alessandro Moschitti, Nianwen Xue, Olga Uryupina, and Yuchen Zhang. *CoNLL-2012 shared task: Modeling multilingual unrestricted coreference in OntoNotes*. In Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2012), Jeju, Korea.2. **PRECO**: A large-scale dataset for coreference resolution, consisting of 35,000 documents. Citation: > Hong Chen, Zhenhua Fan, Hao Lu, Alan Yuille, and Shu Rong. *PRECO: A large-scale dataset in preschool vocabulary for coreference resolution*. In Proceedings of EMNLP, pages 172a181, Brussels, Belgium.3. **ARRAU**: A coreference corpus that includes singletons and expletives, annotated for various linguistic phenomena. Citation: > Olga Uryupina, Ron Artstein, Antonella Bristot, Federica Cavicchio, Francesca Delogu, Kepa J. Rodriguez, and Massimo Poesio. *Annotating a broad range of anaphoric phenomena, in a variety of genres: the ARRAU corpus*. Journal of Natural Language Engineering, To Appear.4. **Phrase Detectives**: A crowdsourced corpus created through a game-with-a-purpose approach, focusing on anaphoric judgments. Citation: > Jon Chamberlain, Massimo Poesio, and Udo Kruschwitz. *Phrase Detectives: A web-based collaborative annotation game*. In Proceedings of I-Semantics 2008.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
