To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PAirwise Image Geometry Encoding for Improved Efficiency in Structure-from-Motion" by Johannes L. SchÃ¶nberger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the efficiency of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) systems and hints at the evaluation of various methods, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** (Section 3) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they list five crowd-sourced image collections and a well-studied dataset of Rome. The datasets are as follows:1. **London Eye**: A dataset used for evaluating image matching techniques.2. **San Marco**: Another dataset for evaluating image matching methods.3. **Tate Modern**: A dataset included in the evaluation.4. **Time Square**: A dataset used to assess the performance of the proposed method.5. **Trafalgar**: The fifth dataset mentioned in the evaluation.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **London Eye**, the citation is: > S. Cao and N. Snavely. *Learning to match images in large-scale collections*. In Proc. ECCV, volume 7583, pages 259a270, 2012.- For **San Marco**, the citation is: > S. Cao and N. Snavely. *Learning to match images in large-scale collections*. In Proc. ECCV, volume 7583, pages 259a270, 2012.- For **Tate Modern**, the citation is: > S. Cao and N. Snavely. *Learning to match images in large-scale collections*. In Proc. ECCV, volume 7583, pages 259a270, 2012.- For **Time Square**, the citation is: > S. Cao and N. Snavely. *Learning to match images in large-scale collections*. In Proc. ECCV, volume 7583, pages 259a270, 2012.- For **Trafalgar**, the citation is: > S. Cao and N. Snavely. *Learning to match images in large-scale collections*. In Proc. ECCV, volume 7583, pages 259a270, 2012.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
