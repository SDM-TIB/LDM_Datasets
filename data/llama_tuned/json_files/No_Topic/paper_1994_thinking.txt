To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Correlational Gaussian Processes for Cross-domain Visual Recognition" by Chengjiang Long and Gang Hua, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on four challenging image collections, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention three specific datasets:1. **E-Album**: This dataset consists of 108 photos taken at 21 locations in 19 events, with 15 different people in 145 detected faces.2. **G-Album**: This dataset contains 312 photos taken at 141 locations in 117 events, with 13 different people in 441 detected faces.3. **SUN 09**: This dataset is noted for containing 12,000 annotated images covering a large number of indoor and outdoor scene categories with >200 object categories and 152,000 annotated object instances.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **E-Album**, the citation is: > J. Cui et al. *EasyAlbum: An interactive photo annotation system based on face clustering and re-ranking*. In Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGCHI International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology, pages 1-8, 2007.- For **G-Album**, the citation is: > A. Gallagher. *Clothing cosegmentation for recognizing people*. In Proceedings of the 2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1-8, 2008.- For **SUN 09**, the citation is: > M. J. Choi et al. *Exploiting hierarchical context on a large database of object categories*. In Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1-8, 2010.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, into a structured format for further processing or review. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
