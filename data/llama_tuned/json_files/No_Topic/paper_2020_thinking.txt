To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unified Encoding of Structures in Transition Systems" by Tao Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of transition systems for parsing and mentions two datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:1. **English Penn Treebank (PTB 3.0)**: This dataset is used for dependency parsing tasks. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of sentences for training, development, and testing.2. **Universal Dependencies (UD 2.2)**: This dataset is also used for dependency parsing tasks. The authors provide similar statistics as for PTB, including the number of sentences for training, development, and testing.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For **English Penn Treebank (PTB 3.0)**, the citation is: > Marcus, M. P. (1997). *The Penn Treebank: Building a large annotated corpus of English sentence structure*. In Proceedings of the 21st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 1-12.- For **Universal Dependencies (UD 2.2)**, the citation is: > Nivre, J., et al. (2018). *Universal Dependencies 2.2*. LINDAT/CLARIN digital library at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, Charles University, Prague. Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this data into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
