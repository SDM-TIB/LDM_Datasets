To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AnaLog: Testing Analytical and Deductive Logic Learnability in Language Models" by Samuel Ryb et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset design sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a new NLI task called **AnaLog**, which suggests that this is a dataset used in their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **dataset design and construction section** (Section 3). Here, the authors describe the **AnaLog dataset** in detail, providing statistics such as the total number of items (24,000) and the types of logical reasoning patterns included. This section is crucial as it outlines the dataset's structure and purpose.In the **dataset design** subsection, the authors mention that the **AnaLog dataset** contains premises, hypotheses, and logical relations, which are generated from templates and a restricted vocabulary. They also specify the types of logical connectives and reasoning domains represented in the dataset, such as spatial and comparative reasoning.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **AnaLog dataset**. The authors reference the LAKNLI dataset as a basis for their work, which is important for understanding the context and relevance of AnaLog.Now, I will compile the dataset information, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I include all relevant details as provided in the paper. The citation for the **AnaLog dataset** is:> Samuel Ryb and Marten Van Schijndel. *Analytical, symbolic and first-order reasoning within neural architectures*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Workshop on Computing Semantics with Types, Frames and Related Structures, 2021.After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that it includes the dataset name, description, and citation for clarity and completeness.
