To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Evaluation of Multimodal Machine Translation" by Desmond Elliott, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of multimodal machine translation systems, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the **Multi30K dataset** as a source of German translation data. This is a strong indication that a dataset is present, and I will look for more details in the subsequent sections.In the **introduction**, the authors reference the **Multi30K dataset** again, noting that it contains 29,000 English-German image tuples. This confirms the dataset's relevance and provides a clear description.I will also check the **methods section** to see if the authors provide additional context or details about the datasets used for evaluation. They mention that the **Multi30K dataset** was used for training the multimodal translation systems, which reinforces its importance.Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Multi30K dataset**. The citation is as follows:> Desmond Elliott, Stella Frank, Lo√Øc Barrault, Fethi Bougares, and Lucia Specia. *Multi30K: Multilingual English-German Image Descriptions*. In Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Vision and Language, pages 70a74, 2016.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the **Multi30K dataset** is the only dataset referenced in this paper.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the citation into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
