To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards the Extraction of Customer-to-Customer Suggestions from Reviews" by Sapna Negi and Paul Buitelaar, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for experiments or evaluations.Next, I will focus on the **data section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, they mention two datasets:1. **TripAdvisor Hotel Reviews Dataset**: This dataset is derived from TripAdvisor hotel reviews, where reviews are segmented into statements with sentiment labels (positive, negative, conflict, and neutral). The authors specify that they use a smaller subset of this dataset for their experiments.2. **Electronic Product Reviews Dataset**: This dataset consists of reviews of electronic products, also split into sentences, and the corresponding sentiment for each sentence is manually tagged. The authors mention that they annotated this dataset for their task.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **TripAdvisor Hotel Reviews Dataset**, the citation is: > Henning Wachsmuth, Martin Trenkmann, Benno Stein, Gregor Engels, and Tsvetomira Palakarska. *A review corpus for argumentation analysis*. In Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing, volume 8404 of LNCS, pages 115a127, Kathmandu, Nepal, Springer, 2014.- For the **Electronic Product Reviews Dataset**, the citation is: > Minqing Hu and Bing Liu. *Mining and summarizing customer reviews*. In Proceedings of the tenth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, KDD a04, pages 168a177, New York, NY, USA, ACM, 2004.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
