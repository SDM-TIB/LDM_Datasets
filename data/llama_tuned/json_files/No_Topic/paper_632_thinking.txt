To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEJFEK: A Lexical and Grammatical Resource for Polish Economic Terminology" by Agata Savary et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the SEJFEK resource, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methodology sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of terminology in NLP and mention the need for large-coverage resources, but they do not specify any datasets. In the **methodology section**, I will look for any sections that detail the creation of the SEJFEK resource, as this may include references to datasets used for training or evaluation.In the **evaluation section**, the authors describe the evaluation corpus used for assessing the effectiveness of their lexicon and grammar. They mention a manually annotated corpus of economic texts derived from Wikipedia articles, which is a strong indication that this is a dataset relevant to their research. The specific dataset is referred to as the **plWikiEconocorpus**, which consists of fragments of Polish Wikipedia articles assigned to economic categories.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the plWikiEconocorpus. The citation is as follows:> Savary, A., Rabiega-WiAniewska, J., and WoliAski, M. *Iniection of Polish Multi-Word Proper Names with Morfeusz and Multiiex*. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5070:111a141, 2009.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the plWikiEconocorpus.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the plWikiEconocorpus, ensuring that it is clear and ready for further processing or review.
