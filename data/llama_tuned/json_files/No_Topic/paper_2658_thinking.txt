To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sampling via Controlled Stochastic Dynamical Systems" by Benjamin J. Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical examples sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a framework for constructing controlled stochastic dynamical systems, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments or evaluations.Next, I will focus on the **numerical examples section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention two specific numerical examples:1. **1-D Gaussian mixture model**: This dataset is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method. The target distribution is described as \(I(x) = 0.6 N(x; 4, 0.52) + 0.4 N(x; 3.6, 1.52)\).2. **2-D distribution**: The authors refer to a "slight modification of an example in [19]" without providing a specific dataset name. However, they describe the target distribution as a slight modification of a normal distribution, which indicates that it is based on a standard normal distribution.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned in the 2-D distribution. The reference is:- For the 2-D distribution, the citation is: > Danilo Jimenez Rezende and Shakir Mohamed. *Variational inference with normalizing flows*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1505.05770, 2015.Since the 1-D Gaussian mixture model does not have a specific dataset citation provided in the paper, I will note that it is a theoretical example rather than a publicly available dataset.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured output for further processing or review.
