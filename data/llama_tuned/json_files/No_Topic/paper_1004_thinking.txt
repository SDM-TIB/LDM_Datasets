To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inducing Latent Semantic Relations for Structured Distributional Semantics" by Sujay Kumar Jauhar and Eduard Hovy, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed model on various semantic tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two specific datasets:1. **WS-353 Dataset**: This dataset is used for the similarity scoring task, consisting of 353 pairs of words along with an averaged similarity score. The authors provide a brief description of the dataset, noting that it includes word pairs presented without context.2. **ESL Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the synonym selection task, containing 50 target words paired with four candidate lexical substitutes. The authors mention that they chose this dataset over the TOEFL dataset due to its more complex vocabulary, which is relevant for their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For the **WS-353 Dataset**, the citation is: > Lev Finkelstein, Evgeniy Gabrilovich, Yossi Matias, Ehud Rivlin, Zach Solan, Gadi Wolfman, and Eytan Ruppin. *Placing search in context: The concept revisited*. In ACM Transactions on Information Systems, volume 20, pages 116a131, January 2002.- For the **ESL Dataset**, the citation is: > Peter D. Turney. *Mining the web for synonyms: PMI-ir versus LSA on TOEFL*. CoRR, 2002.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
