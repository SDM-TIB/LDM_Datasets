To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adapting Predicate Frames for Urdu PropBanking" by Riyaz Ahmad Bhata et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the adaptation of predicate frames for Urdu PropBanking, which suggests that datasets related to Urdu and PropBanking are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the Hindi-Urdu treebanking project and the use of PropBanking, indicating that datasets related to these projects may be referenced later.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their approach to adapting predicate frames from Arabic and Hindi PropBanks for Urdu PropBanking. They mention the use of the **Hindi PropBank** and the **Urdu PropBank**, which are key datasets for their work.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:- For the **Hindi PropBank**, the citation is: > Paul Kingsbury and Martha Palmer. *From treebank to propbank*. In LREC, 2002.- For the **Urdu PropBank**, the citation is: > Rajesh Bhatt, Bhuvana Narasimhan, Martha Palmer, Owen Rambow, Dipti Misra Sharma, and Fei Xia. *A multi-representational and multi-layered treebank for hindi/urdu*. In Proceedings of the Third Linguistic Annotation Workshop, pages 186a189, 2009.- Additionally, the authors reference the **Hindi-Urdu treebanking project**, which is a collaborative effort, but I will note that it does not have a specific citation in the paper since it is a project rather than a dataset.Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as identified. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
