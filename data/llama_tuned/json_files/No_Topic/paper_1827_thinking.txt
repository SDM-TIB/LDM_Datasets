To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Warp to the Future: Joint Forecasting of Features and Feature Motion" by Josip ESariA c et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the **Cityscapes dataset** for semantic segmentation, which indicates that this is a key dataset for the research.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention using an **inely annotated subset of the Cityscapes dataset** for their experiments, which includes 2975 training images, 500 validation images, and 1525 test images. This confirms the dataset's relevance and provides details about its structure.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Cityscapes dataset. The citation is as follows:> Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 3213a3223, 2016.Since the paper primarily focuses on the Cityscapes dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset.After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Cityscapes dataset, ensuring that it is clear and ready for further processing or review.
