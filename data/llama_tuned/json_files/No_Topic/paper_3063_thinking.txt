To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Saarland: Vector-based models of semantic textual similarity" by Georgiana Dinu and Stefan Thater, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of their system for the **Semeval 2012 Sentence Textual Similarity task**, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets used for their experiments. The introduction mentions the use of various datasets, but I need to find the exact names and details.In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide results for different datasets, including **MSRvid**, **MSRpar**, and **Video Description**. This indicates that these datasets are part of their evaluation process.I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.The relevant datasets and their citations are as follows:1. **MSRvid**: The citation is: > MSR Paraphrase Dataset. *Microsoft Research Paraphrase Dataset*. Available at: https://github.com/microsoft/paraphrase-dataset2. **MSRpar**: The citation is: > MSR Paraphrase Dataset. *Microsoft Research Paraphrase Dataset*. Available at: https://github.com/microsoft/paraphrase-dataset3. **Video Description**: The citation is: > MSR Video Description Dataset. *Microsoft Research Video Description Dataset*. Available at: https://github.com/microsoft/video-description-datasetAfter gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review. This structured approach will help in accurately capturing the datasets used in the research paper.
