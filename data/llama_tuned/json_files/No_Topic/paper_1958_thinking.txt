To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Graph Evolution: Towards Efficient Automatic Robot Design" by Tingwu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a physics engine for model-based control, which suggests that datasets related to robotics or simulations might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe the environments used for their experiments, specifically mentioning the **MuJoCo physics engine**. This indicates that MuJoCo is a dataset or tool used for simulating robotic environments.I will also check the **background and related works sections** to see if any other datasets are referenced. The authors mention the use of MuJoCo in the context of robotic locomotion control, which reinforces its significance in their experiments.Now, I will look for the **references section** to find the full citation for MuJoCo. The relevant citation is:- For **MuJoCo**, the citation is: > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on, pages 5026a5033, 2012. IEEE, 2012.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for MuJoCo, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format for further processing or review.
