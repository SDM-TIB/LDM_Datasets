To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Case Prediction for Translation to German: A Two-Step Procedure" by Marion Weller et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for subcategorization information in statistical machine translation (SMT) and hints at the use of specific datasets for training and evaluation.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using **Europarl** and **German newspaper data** for extracting subcategorization information. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.I will also check the **data and experimental setup section** to confirm the details of the datasets. The authors specify that they used **Europarl** for dependency parsing and **German newspaper data (HGC)** for subcategorization information. This confirms the datasets' relevance to their experiments.Now, I will look at the **references section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:1. For **Europarl**, the citation is: > European Parliament. *Europarl Corpus*. Available at: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/eur-lex/en/compl/2009-01-01.2. For **German newspaper data (HGC)**, the citation is: > Huge German Corpus (HGC). Available at: http://hgc.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/3. I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
