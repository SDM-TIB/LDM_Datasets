To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Latent Traversal with Semantic Constraints" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on two face datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. Here, they refer to two datasets:1. **FFHQ Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing high-quality face images of resolution 1024x1024. It is used for evaluating the proposed method.2. **CelebA-HQ Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as containing high-quality face images of resolution 1024x1024, similar to FFHQ. It is used for the same evaluation purposes.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **FFHQ Dataset**, the citation is: > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 4401a4410, 2019.- For the **CelebA-HQ Dataset**, the citation is: > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *Progressive growing of GANs for improved quality, stability, and variation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10196, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
