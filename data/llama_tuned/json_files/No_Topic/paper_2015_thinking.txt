To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Semantic Type Representation for Zero-Shot Event Extraction" by Wasi Uddin Ahmad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the framework for zero-shot event extraction and mentions the **ACE2005 dataset** as a benchmark for evaluation, indicating that this is a dataset used in their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation process. They explicitly state that they conducted extensive evaluation on the **ACE2005 dataset**, which has 33 event subtypes and 28 role types. This confirms that ACE2005 is the primary dataset used in their research.In the **dataset description**, the authors provide details about the ACE2005 dataset, including its structure and the tasks it supports. They mention that it includes both entity and value roles, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's application in their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ACE2005 dataset. The citation is as follows:> Wasi Uddin Ahmad, Nanyun Peng, and Kai-Wei Chang. *Gate: Graph attention transformer encoder for cross-lingual relation and event extraction*. In The Thirty-Fifth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-21), 2021.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the ACE2005 dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for ACE2005, ensuring that it includes the necessary details and citation, ready for further processing or review.
