To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Tweet Retrieval with Compact Binary Codes" by Weiwei Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a tweet dataset for evaluating the proposed method, which indicates that a dataset is present.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention collecting a tweet dataset consisting of 1.35 million tweets over three months, with each tweet having exactly one hashtag. This is a clear indication of the dataset's name and characteristics.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide additional details about the dataset, including the number of tweets, word tokens, unique words, and hashtags. They also mention that the dataset is used to create groundtruth labels based on Twitter hashtags, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's purpose.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the tweet dataset in the references. Instead, it mentions that the dataset is freely available on the Web, which suggests that it may not have a formal citation like traditional datasets. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is publicly available and does not have a formal citation.In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:1. **Tweet Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1.35 million tweets over 3 months, with each tweet having exactly one hashtag. It is used to create groundtruth labels based on Twitter hashtags, and it is freely available on the Web without a formal citation.Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the note about its availability.
