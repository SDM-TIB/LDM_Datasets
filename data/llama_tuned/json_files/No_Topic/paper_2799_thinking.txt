To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparing Data Sources and Architectures for Deep Visual Representation Learning in Semantics" by Douwe Kiela, Anita L. VerEo, and Stephen Clark, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the comparison of deep visual representation learning techniques and mentions various data sources, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the importance of multi-modal representation learning and the need for systematic comparisons. They mention several data sources, including Google Images, Bing Images, Flickr, ImageNet, and the ESP Game dataset, indicating that these are the datasets used in their experiments.In the **methods section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets. They describe the data sources as follows:1. **Google Images**: A search engine that returns images for almost any query, providing a large number of images.2. **Bing Images**: Another image search engine that offers the same functionality as Google Images.3. **Flickr**: A photo sharing service where images are tagged by human annotators, providing a diverse set of images.4. **ImageNet**: A large-scale hierarchical image database used for various computer vision applications.5. **ESP Game**: A dataset constructed through a game where players agreed on word labels for randomly selected images, resulting in a dataset with interesting qualitative differences in image quality.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset:- For **Google Images**, the citation is: > Google Images. Available at: https://images.google.com/- For **Bing Images**, the citation is: > Bing Images. Available at: https://www.bing.com/images- For **Flickr**, the citation is: > Flickr. Available at: https://www.flickr.com/- For **ImageNet**, the citation is: > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Fei-Fei Li. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of CVPR, pages 248a255, 2009.- For **ESP Game**, the citation is: > Luis von Ahn and Laura Dabbish. *Labeling images with a computer game*. In CHI, pages 319a326, 2004.Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
