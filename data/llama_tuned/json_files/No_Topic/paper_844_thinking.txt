To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Efficient Technique for Denoising Sentences using Monolingual Corpus and Synonym Dictionary" by Sanjay Chatterjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a method for denoising sentences using a monolingual corpus and a synonym dictionary, which suggests that datasets related to these components may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using a **Hindi and Bengali monolingual corpus** and **Hindi and Bengali synonym dictionaries**. These are the primary datasets referenced in the context of their method.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific dataset names, but it does mention the sources of the monolingual corpus and synonym dictionaries. The monolingual corpus is described as being crawled from the web and cleaned, while the synonym dictionaries are referenced as being specific to Hindi and Bengali languages.Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered:1. **Hindi and Bengali Monolingual Corpus**: - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is described as being crawled from the web and cleaned. - Description: A monolingual corpus used for denoising sentences in Hindi and Bengali languages.2. **Hindi and Bengali Synonym Dictionaries**: - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is mentioned as being used for word replacement in the denoising process. - Description: Dictionaries that provide synonyms for words in Hindi and Bengali, aiding in the correction of noisy sentences.Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their descriptions, preparing them for further processing or review.
