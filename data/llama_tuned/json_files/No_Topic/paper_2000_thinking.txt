To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Samsung: Align-and-Differentiate Approach to Semantic Textual Similarity" by Lushan Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved top results on several evaluation datasets, which suggests that datasets are crucial for their evaluation.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide any specific names of datasets used in their approach. The introduction mentions the UMBC PairingWords system, which is a foundation for their approach, but it does not explicitly list datasets. I will need to look further into the **methodology and results sections** for more detailed information.In the **results section**, the authors mention that their approach improved upon the UMBC PairingWords system and achieved top results on five evaluation datasets. This indicates that these datasets are significant for their evaluation, but I need to find their names and details.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the UMBC PairingWords system, which is a key component of their approach, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments. The paper does not provide a comprehensive list of datasets in the introduction or methodology, so I will need to look for any datasets mentioned in the context of their results or experiments.After reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the following datasets in the results section:1. **UMBC PairingWords System**: This dataset is referenced as the foundation for their approach, but it is not a dataset in the traditional sense, as it is a system rather than a dataset.2. **UMBC WebBase**: This dataset is mentioned as the source of the distributional word similarity model used in their approach.3. **Headlines Dataset**: This dataset is explicitly mentioned as one of the evaluation datasets used in the results. It consists of 750 pairs of headlines and is used for semantic textual similarity evaluation.4. **Images Dataset**: Another dataset mentioned in the results, this one includes 750 pairs of images and is also used for evaluating the proposed approach.5. **Students Dataset**: This dataset is part of the evaluation, consisting of 750 pairs of student-related text.6. **Forums Dataset**: This dataset includes 375 pairs of forum-related text and is used for evaluation purposes.7. **Beliefs Dataset**: This dataset consists of 375 pairs of belief-related text and is also used in the evaluation process.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as I find them in the references. The citations for the datasets are as follows:- For **UMBC PairingWords System**, the citation is: > Lushan Han, Abhay L. Kashyap, James Mayield, and Johnathan Weese. *UMBC EBIQUITY-CORE: Semantic Textual Similarity*.
