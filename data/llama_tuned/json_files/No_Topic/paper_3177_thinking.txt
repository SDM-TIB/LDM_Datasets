To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CAUSAL-TGAN: CAUSALLY-AWARE TABULAR DATAGENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses synthetic tabular data generation and mentions the use of both simulated and real-world datasets, indicating that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **method section**, where the authors describe their approach and may provide specific datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and **Kaggle datasets** for real-world datasets. This is a strong indication that datasets are being utilized.I will also check the **experimental results section** to confirm the datasets used for evaluation. The authors explicitly state that they used the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and **Kaggle datasets** for their experiments, which includes the following datasets:1. **Adult Dataset**: A well-known dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing demographic information about adults.2. **Census Dataset**: Another dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, focusing on census data.3. **Intrusion Dataset**: A dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, related to network intrusion detection.4. **News Dataset**: A dataset from Kaggle, containing news articles for analyzing news popularity.Now, I will look at the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, the citation is: > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. 2017. URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/- For the **Kaggle datasets**, I will check the Kaggle website for the specific datasets mentioned. The citation for the **News Dataset** is: > Kaggle. *Online News Popularity Dataset*. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online_news_popularityAfter gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
