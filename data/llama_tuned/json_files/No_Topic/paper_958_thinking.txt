To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Localized Random Projections for Bio-plausible Deep Learning Challenges" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the MNIST dataset for benchmarking, which indicates that this dataset is likely to be included.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the MNIST dataset as a benchmark for their experiments. This confirms that MNIST is a key dataset used in their research.In the **methods section**, the authors describe their experiments and mention the use of the MNIST dataset for training and testing their models. They also reference the CIFAR10 dataset for comparison, indicating that both datasets are utilized in their work.Now, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional details about the datasets, such as the number of samples or specific configurations used. The results section confirms that both MNIST and CIFAR10 are used for evaluation.In the **references section**, I will look for the full citations of the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:- For **MNIST**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2010. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
