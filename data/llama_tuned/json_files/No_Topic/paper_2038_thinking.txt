To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Classification of Communicative Functions of Deiniteness" by Archna Bhatia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for analysis.Next, I will focus on the **data section** (section 3), where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention using the **English deiniteness corpus** developed by Bhatia et al. (2014). This section will provide essential details about the dataset, including its composition and purpose.In the **data section**, I find that the authors describe the English deiniteness corpus as consisting of 17 documents from various genres, including TED talks, a presidential address, and fictional narratives. They also mention that the corpus contains 13,860 words and 3,422 annotated noun phrases (NPs). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the English deiniteness corpus. The relevant citation is:- For the **English deiniteness corpus**, the citation is: > Archna Bhatia, Mandy Simons, Lori Levin, Yulia Tsvetkov, Chris Dyer, and Jordan Bender. *A unified annotation scheme for the semantic/pragmatic components of deiniteness*. In Proc. of LREC, Reykjavik, Iceland, 2014.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the English deiniteness corpus.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the English deiniteness corpus, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
