To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AstroNet: When Astrocyte Meets Artificial Neural Network" by Mengqiao Hana Liyuan Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed AstroNet model and mentions experiments on three public datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the research.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:1. **ImageNet-1k**: This dataset is widely used for image classification tasks and is referenced as one of the datasets used for evaluating the AstroNet model.2. **CIFAR10**: Another well-known dataset for image classification, CIFAR10 is also mentioned as part of the experiments.3. **MNIST**: This dataset is commonly used for handwritten digit image classification tasks and is included in the experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For **ImageNet-1k**, the citation is: > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248a255, 2009.- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.- For **MNIST**, the citation is: > Li Deng. *The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for IEEE Signal Processing Magazine*. Processing Magazine, 29(6):141a142, 2012.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
