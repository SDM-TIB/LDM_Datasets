To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The CoNLL-SIGMORPHON 2017 Shared Task: Universal Morphological Reinjection" by Garrett Nicolai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on five languages (English, German, Persian, Polish, and Spanish), which suggests that datasets related to these languages may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the use of a discriminative transduction system and neural models, but they do not specify any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the methods for more detailed information.In the **methods section**, the authors describe their approach and the datasets used for training and testing. They mention that the training data is limited to 100 labeled examples for each language, which implies that there are specific datasets associated with each language. However, they do not provide explicit names of these datasets in the text.I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors reference any datasets used for evaluation or testing. They mention that the results are based on five languages, but again, no specific datasets are named.After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors do not provide detailed descriptions of specific datasets. However, they do reference the **Wikipedia corpus** for generating synthetic training data for their neural models, which is a crucial dataset for their experiments.Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Wikipedia corpus, as it is likely the primary dataset used in their experiments. The citation for the Wikipedia corpus is:- For the **Wikipedia corpus**, the citation is: > Wikipedia contributors. *Wikipedia*. Available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_(free_content)Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the primary dataset used is the Wikipedia corpus.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the Wikipedia corpus, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
