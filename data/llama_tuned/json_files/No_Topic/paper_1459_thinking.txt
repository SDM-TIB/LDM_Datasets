To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Linguistically Informed Convolutional Neural Network for Sentiment Analysis" by Sebastian Ebert et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for sentiment analysis, which suggests that datasets related to sentiment analysis may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using the **SemEval 2015 dataset** for their experiments. This is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their research.I will also check the **data section** (section 5.1) for more details about the datasets. Here, the authors explicitly state that they use the **SemEval 2015 dataset** for training and evaluation. They provide a table listing the dataset sizes, which confirms its significance in their experiments.Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the SemEval 2015 dataset. The citation is as follows:> Sara Rosenthal, Preslav Nakov, Svetlana Kiritchenko, Saif M. Mohammad, Alan Ritter, and Veselin Stoyanov. *SemEval-2015 Task 10: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter*. In SemEval, 2015.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the SemEval 2015 dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the SemEval 2015 dataset, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
