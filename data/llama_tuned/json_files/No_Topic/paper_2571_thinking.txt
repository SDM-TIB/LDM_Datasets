To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks" by Jinsung Yoona et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on various real and synthetic time-series datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention several datasets used for evaluation. I will look for a subsection that details the datasets, which is likely to be found in the **experiments section**.In this paper, the authors describe the following datasets:1. **Sines**: This dataset consists of multivariate sinusoidal sequences of different frequencies and phases, providing continuous-valued, periodic, multivariate data.2. **Stocks**: This dataset includes daily historical Google stocks data from 2004 to 2019, featuring various financial metrics such as volume, high, low, opening, closing, and adjusted closing prices.3. **Energy**: The UCI Appliances energy prediction dataset is characterized by multivariate, continuous-valued measurements with numerous temporal features measured at close intervals.4. **Events**: This dataset contains sequences of events and their times, modeled to include both the one-hot encoded sequence of event types and the event timings.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **Sines**, the citation is: > Jinsung Yoona, Daniel Jarretta, and Mihaela van der Schaar. *Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks*. In Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada.- For **Stocks**, the citation is: > Jinsung Yoona, Daniel Jarretta, and Mihaela van der Schaar. *Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks*. In Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada.- For **Energy**, the citation is: > Jinsung Yoona, Daniel Jarretta, and Mihaela van der Schaar. *Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks*. In Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada.- For **Events**, the citation is: > Jinsung Yoona, Daniel Jarretta, and Mihaela van der Schaar. *Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks*. In Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
