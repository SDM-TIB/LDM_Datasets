To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modality and Component Aware Feature Fusion for RGB-D Scene Classification" by Anran Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on the **SUNRGBD Dataset** and the **NYU Depth Dataset V2**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, they mention:1. **SUNRGBD Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,335 RGB-D scene images, including 3,784 Kinect v2 images, 1,159 Intel RealSense images, 1,449 Kinect v1 images from the NYU Depth Dataset V2, 554 Kinect v1 images from the Berkeley B3DODataset, and 3,389 Asus Xtion images from SUN3D videos. The authors specify that they used a subset of categories with more than 80 images for training and testing.2. **NYU Depth Dataset V2**: This dataset contains 1,449 images, organized into 10 scene categories, with 795 images for training and 654 images for testing.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **SUNRGBD Dataset**, the citation is: > Song, S., Lichtenberg, S. P., & Xiao, J. (2015). SUNRGBD: A RGB-D scene understanding benchmark suite. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 567-576.- For the **NYU Depth Dataset V2**, the citation is: > Silberman, P. K. N., Hoiem, D., & Fergus, R. (2012). Indoor segmentation and support inference from RGB-D images. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 746-760.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
