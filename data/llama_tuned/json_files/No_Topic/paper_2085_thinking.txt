To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lexical access via a simple co-occurrence network" by Gemma Bel-Enguix and Michael Zock, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the construction of a co-occurrence network based on Wikipedia abstracts, which indicates that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide any specific names or details about the datasets used. The introduction mentions the use of Wikipedia abstracts, which suggests that this is a primary dataset for their research.In the **methods section**, the authors describe the dataset in detail. They state that they built a co-occurrence graph based on the entire set of Wikipedia's abstracts, which contains approximately 4 million documents. This is a significant dataset for their study.I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional context or metrics related to the dataset, but it appears that the dataset is primarily described in the introduction and methods.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference Wikipedia as the source of the dataset, but they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself. However, I can infer that the dataset is based on the Wikipedia abstracts, and the citation for Wikipedia is:> Wikipedia. *Wikipedia abstracts*. Available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AbstractsSince the paper does not provide a specific dataset name, I will use the citation for Wikipedia as the dataset reference.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the information gathered, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Wikipedia abstracts as the dataset used in the research.
