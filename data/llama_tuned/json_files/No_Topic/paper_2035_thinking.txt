To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Les temps de traitement des voix de femmes et d'hommes sont-ils Aquivalents?" by Erwan Papiot, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the processing time of female and male voices, which suggests that datasets related to speech processing might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using 61 words and 8 locuteurs francophones (4 women and 4 men) for their experiments. This indicates that there is a dataset related to speech processing that includes audio recordings of both male and female voices.In the **method section**, the authors specify that they recorded audio enregistrements of 61 words, which implies that this is a dataset used for their experiments. They also mention that the recordings were made in a controlled environment, which suggests that the dataset is structured for their specific study.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the Ministry of Education, National Institute of Education, and the French National Audiovisual Institute (INRA) for the list of words used in their experiments. This indicates that the dataset is based on a standardized list of words, which is crucial for citation purposes.The citation for the dataset is:> Ministère de l'Éducation Nationale, de la Jeunesse et de la Vie Associative. *Liste des mots classés par fréquence de décroissance*. Available at: http://eduscol.education.fr/cid47916/liste-des-mots-classee-par-frequence-decroissante.htmlSince the paper does not provide a specific dataset name, I will refer to the list of words used in the experiments as the dataset. The authors mention that they used 61 words, which are part of the standardized list provided by the Ministry of Education.Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the relevant details, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and accurate representation of the dataset used in the research.
