To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Propbank Generation for Turkish" by Koray Ak and O. T. YAldAz, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the creation of an automatic Turkish PropBank using parallel data from the English PropBank, indicating that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to gather more context about the datasets. The authors mention the importance of semantic resources for SRL and reference several existing datasets, including PropBank and NomBank. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for their method.In the **methods section**, I will look for specific datasets used in their experiments. The authors describe the construction of a Turkish Proposition Bank using parallel sentences from the English PropBank, which indicates that the English PropBank is a key dataset for their work.I will also check the **results section** to see if they mention any additional datasets used for evaluation or comparison. The authors refer to the Turkish hand-annotated proposition bank (Ak et al., 2018) and the ITU-METU-SabancA Treebank, which are likely datasets used in their experiments.Now, I will consult the **references section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:1. **English PropBank**: The citation is: > Palmer, M., Gildea, D., & Kingsbury, P. (2004). The proposition bank: An annotated corpus of semantic roles. Computational Linguistics, 31(1), 71-106.2. **ITU-METU-SabancA Treebank**: The citation is: > SA ahin, G. G. (2016a). Framing of verbs for Turkish PropBank. In TurCLing 2016 in conj. with 17th International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics (CICLING 2016).3. **Turkish Proposition Bank**: The citation is: > Ak, K., YAldAz, O. T., Esgel, V., & Toprak, C. (2018). Construction of a Turkish proposition bank. Turkish Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 26, 570-581.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
