To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kannada Sandhi Generator for Lopa and Adesha Sandhi" by Musica Supriya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a sandhi generator for Kannada, which suggests that there may be datasets related to Kannada language or sandhi rules.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction discusses the importance of sandhi in Kannada but does not explicitly mention any datasets.In the **methodology section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or testing the sandhi generator. The authors mention that they manually extracted 386 unique pairs of Kannada words, which indicates that this is a dataset derived from their own work, but I need to confirm if it has a formal citation.Since the paper does not provide a formal dataset citation, I will check the **results and analysis section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the work of Reddy and Sharoff (2011) for cross-language pos taggers, which may imply that their dataset is relevant. However, I need to confirm the details of this dataset.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned in the paper. The relevant citation for the dataset related to Kannada is:- For the dataset from Reddy and Sharoff (2011), the citation is: > Siva Reddy and Serge Sharoff. *Cross language pos taggers (and other tools) for Indian languages: An experiment with Kannada using Telugu resources*. In Proceedings of the 2011 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-10, 2011.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in future work. This systematic approach will help ensure that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper.
