To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Interplay of User-Centered Dialog Systems and AI Planning" by Florian Nothdurft et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced or described. The abstract discusses the integration of AI Planning techniques into dialog systems, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments or evaluations.Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** (Section 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention that they conducted a user study involving 104 participants, which indicates that there is a dataset related to user interactions and responses.In the **evaluation section**, the authors describe the user's task of creating strength training workouts, which implies that they collected data from this task. They mention that the user's responses and interactions were recorded, but they do not provide a specific dataset name. However, they do reference a questionnaire used to assess user trust and satisfaction, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets or methodologies used in the study. The authors reference various works, but I need to identify if any of these references correspond to datasets or methodologies that were utilized in their experiments.After reviewing the paper, I find that the authors used a **Human-Computer Trust (HCT) questionnaire** to assess user trust, which is a well-known dataset in the field of human-computer interaction. The citation for this questionnaire is:> Maria Madsen and Shirley Gregor. *Measuring human-computer trust*. In Proceedings of the 11th Australasian Conference on Information Systems, pages 6a8, 2000. ISMRC, QUT.Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the HCT questionnaire, ensuring to include the full citation as it is essential for proper attribution.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that I include all relevant details and citations accurately.
