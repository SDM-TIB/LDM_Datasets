To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using CollGram to Compare Formulaic Language in Human and Machine Translation" by Yves Bestgen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses comparing formulaic sequences in human and neural machine translation, which suggests that datasets related to translation and linguistic analysis may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly the subsection titled "Translation Corpus." Here, the author describes the datasets used for the study, specifically mentioning the **PLECI corpus**. The PLECI corpus is a sentence-aligned translation corpus of quality newspaper articles in French and English, which is crucial for the analysis of formulaic language in translation.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PLECI corpus. The citation is as follows:> Lenko-Szymanska, A., & Wolk, A. (2016). A corpus-based analysis of the development of phraseological competence in EFL learners using the CollGram profile. In Paper presented at the 7th Conference of the Formulaic Language Research Network (FLaRN).Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:1. **PLECI Corpus**: This dataset consists of 2,799 texts from quality newspaper articles in French and English, totaling 570,000 words in the original version and 500,000 words in the translation. The dataset is used to analyze formulaic language in human and machine translation.Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the dataset name, description, and citation are accurately represented.
