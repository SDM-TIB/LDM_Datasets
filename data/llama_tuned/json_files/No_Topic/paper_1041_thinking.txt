To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discriminative Feature-to-Point Matching in Image-Based Localization" by Michael Donoser and Dieter Schmalstieg, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses image-based localization and mentions the use of datasets for evaluation, which indicates that datasets are present.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 5.1), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to two datasets:1. **Dubrovnik Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 6,000 images, 2 million points, and 10 million descriptors. It is derived from Flickr images and is used for evaluating the proposed method in the context of image-based localization.2. **Rome Dataset**: This dataset contains around 15,000 images, 4 million points, and 21 million descriptors, also sourced from Flickr. It is used for the same purpose as the Dubrovnik dataset.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Dubrovnik Dataset**, the citation is: > Y. Li, N. Snavely, and D. Huttenlocher. *Location recognition using prioritized feature matching*. In ECCV, 2010.- For the **Rome Dataset**, the citation is: > Y. Li, N. Snavely, and D. Huttenlocher. *Location recognition using prioritized feature matching*. In ECCV, 2010.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
