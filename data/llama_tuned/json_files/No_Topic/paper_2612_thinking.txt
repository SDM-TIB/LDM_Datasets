To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Prediction of Morphosemantic Relations" by Svetla Koeva et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper involves a machine learning method for identifying morphosemantic relations, which suggests that datasets related to wordnets and morphosemantic relations are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the use of the **Bulgarian WordNet (BulNet)** and reference the **Princeston WordNet (PWN)**, which indicates that these wordnets are datasets relevant to their work. In the **methods section**, they describe the preprocessing steps and mention the **BulNet** and **PWN** datasets again, confirming their use in the experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors specify that the core training data consist of 6,641 morphosemantically related verb-noun literal pairs from **BulNet**. They also mention a **negative examples dataset** extracted from **BulNet**, which includes 170,000 instances of verb-noun pairs that do not have a morphosemantic relation.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For **Bulgarian WordNet (BulNet)**, the citation is: > Svetla Koeva, Cvetana Krstev, and Dusko Vitas. *Morphosemantic relations in Wordnet a a case study for two Slavic languages*. In Proceedings of the Fourth Global WordNet Conference (GWC2008), pages 239a254, 2008.2. For **Princeston WordNet (PWN)**, the citation is: > Christiane Fellbaum, Anne Osherson, and Peter E. Clark. *Putting semantics into WordNet as Clark*. In Proceedings of the Third Language and Technology Conference, Poznan, Poland, 2009.3. The **negative examples dataset** is derived from **BulNet**, so I will cite it as: > Svetla Koeva, Svetlozara Leseva, Ivelina Stoyanova, Tsvetana Dimitrova, Maria Todorova, and Ekaterina Tarpomanova. *Automatic semantic filtering of morphosemantic relations in WordNet*. In Proceedings of CLIB 2014, Soia, Bulgaria, pages 14a22, 2014.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
