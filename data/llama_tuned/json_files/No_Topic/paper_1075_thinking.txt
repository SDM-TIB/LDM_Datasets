To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Emotion Inference in Multi-Turn Conversations with Addressee-Aware Module and Ensemble Strategy" by Dayu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted empirical studies on three different benchmark conversation datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled **Datasets**. Here, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for evaluation:1. **IEMOCAP**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for emotion recognition in dyadic dialogue.2. **MELD**: The authors describe MELD as a multimodal multi-party dataset for emotion recognition in conversations.3. **EmoryNLP**: This dataset is mentioned as another benchmark for emotion detection in TV show transcripts.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For **IEMOCAP**, the citation is: > Carlos Busso, Murtaza Bulut, Chi-Chun Lee, Abe Kazemzadeh, Emily Mower, Samuel Kim, Jennette N Chang, Sungbok Lee, and Shrikanth SNarayanan. *IEMOCAP: Interactive emotional dyadic motion capture database*. Language Resources and Evaluation, 42(4):335a359, 2008.- For **MELD**, the citation is: > Soujanya Poria, Devamanyu Hazarika, Navonil Majumder, Gautam Naik, Erik Cambria, and Rada Mihalcea. *MELD: A multimodal multi-party dataset for emotion recognition in conversations*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 527a536, 2019.- For **EmoryNLP**, the citation is: > Sayyed M Zahiri and Jinho D Choi. *Emotion detection on TV show transcripts with sequence-based convolutional neural networks*. In AAAI Workshops, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
