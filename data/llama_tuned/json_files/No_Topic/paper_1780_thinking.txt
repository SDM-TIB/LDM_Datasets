To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Rare Category Classifiers on a Tight Labeling Budget" by Ravi Teja Mullapudi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of training models for rare categories and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they state that they evaluate their approach on two datasets:1. **iNaturalist**: This dataset is described as a fine-grained species recognition dataset, containing images of various species. The authors specify that they randomly choose 50 categories from this dataset for their experiments.2. **Places**: This dataset is mentioned as a scene classification dataset, containing images of scenes from around the world. The authors note that they randomly select 20 categories from this dataset for their evaluation.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **iNaturalist**, the citation is: > Grant Van Horn, Oisin Mac Aodha, Yang Song, Yin Cui, Chen Sun, Alex Shepard, Hartwig Adam, Pietro Perona, and Serge Belongie. *The iNaturalist species classification and detection dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 8769a8778, 2018.- For **Places**, the citation is: > Bolei Zhou, Agata Lapedriza, Aditya Khosla, Aude Oliva, and Antonio Torralba. *Places: A 10 million image database for scene recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
