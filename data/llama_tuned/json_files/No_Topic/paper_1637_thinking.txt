To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lexical Resource Building and Maintenance Based on the Use of the Meaning-Text Theory" by Laurie Planes, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets, such as a dedicated **"Datasets" or "Materials and Methods" section**. In this paper, the author discusses the construction of a lexical resource based on the Meaning-Text Theory, which suggests that datasets related to lexical resources or linguistic analysis may be involved.In the **construction and maintenance section**, the author mentions the use of a lexicon constructed from a specific source, which indicates that there may be a dataset or corpus referenced. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned, such as the source of the lexicon or any datasets used for enrichment or maintenance of the lexical resource.After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.For this paper, I will look for any references to datasets or corpora that the author has utilized for lexical resource building and maintenance. If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will also consider any related works or sources that may have been cited in the references.Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:1. **Lexicon Source**: The paper mentions a lexicon constructed from a lexique existant, but it does not specify the exact dataset or source of this lexicon.2. **Enrichment and Maintenance**: The author discusses the process of enriching the lexicon through user feedback and linguistic expertise, but again, no specific datasets are named.In conclusion, while the paper discusses the construction and maintenance of a lexical resource, it does not provide explicit dataset names or citations. Therefore, I will note that the paper references a lexicon constructed from an existing source without providing a specific dataset name or citation.
