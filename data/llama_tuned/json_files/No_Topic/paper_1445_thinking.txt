To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Self-supervised Joint Training Framework for Document Reranking" by Xiaozhi Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two widely used datasets for document reranking, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:1. **MS MARCO Passage Ranking**: This dataset is described as a large-scale dataset consisting of real anonymous questions from the Bing search engine and approximately 8.8 million candidate passages for the passage reranking task. The training set contains about 500,000 positive query-passage pairs, with the development set and evaluation set containing 6,980 queries and 6,837 queries, respectively, with relevance labels provided for the development set.2. **TREC Robust 2004**: This dataset is a newswire collection used by TREC 2004 Robust track, comprising 250 queries and 0.5 million documents (TREC Disks 4 and 5).The authors provide statistics for both datasets, including the number of queries, passages, and relevance labels, which confirms their relevance for the experiments conducted.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **MS MARCO Passage Ranking**, the citation is: > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. In CoCoNLP, 2016.- For **TREC Robust 2004**, the citation is: > Ellen M Voorhees. *Overview of the TREC 2004 Robust retrieval track*. In Proceedings of the 2004 Robust Track Workshop, 2004.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
