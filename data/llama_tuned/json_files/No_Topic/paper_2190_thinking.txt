To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Remote Heart Rate Measurement From Face Videos Under Realistic Situations" by Xiaobai Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their framework on a large public database, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to gather more context about the datasets. The authors mention that they evaluate their framework on a multi-modal database called **MAHNOB-HCI**, which is a public database that includes large samples of facial videos and corresponding ground truth HR signals. This is a strong indication that MAHNOB-HCI is a key dataset for their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They explicitly state that they used the **MAHNOB-HCI database** for their experiments, confirming its significance in their research. They also mention that they used a simple self-collected database called **VideoHR** for a preliminary test, but the primary dataset for evaluation is MAHNOB-HCI.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **MAHNOB-HCI database**. The citation is as follows:> M. Soleymani, J. Lichtenauer, T. Pun, and M. Pantic. *A multi-modal database for affect recognition and implicit tagging*. IEEE Trans. on Affective Computing, 2(3):1â€“13, 2012. https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2012.6256This citation provides the necessary information to describe the MAHNOB-HCI dataset.Finally, I will summarize the datasets identified:1. **MAHNOB-HCI**: A multi-modal database for affect recognition and implicit tagging, containing large samples of facial videos and corresponding ground truth HR signals.2. **VideoHR**: A simple self-collected database used for preliminary testing of the proposed framework.Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
