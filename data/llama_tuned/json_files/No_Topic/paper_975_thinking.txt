To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MeasEval: Extracting Counts and Measurements and their Related Contexts" by Corey A Harper et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the task and may mention datasets used for training or evaluation.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors discuss any specific datasets in relation to their work. This section often contains references to datasets that are crucial for understanding the context of the research.In the **methodology section**, particularly the subsections detailing the data and annotations, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets. This section typically provides detailed information about the datasets, including their size, structure, and purpose.In the **data and annotations section**, the authors describe the MeasEval dataset, which is a key dataset for their task. They mention that the dataset includes 110 CC-BY licensed articles, which were annotated by multiple annotators, resulting in a total of 428 paragraphs with 1663 quantities. This section provides essential details about the dataset's composition and its relevance to the research.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MeasEval dataset. The citation is as follows:> Corey A Harper, Jessica Cox, Curt Kohler, Antony Scerri, Ron Daniel, and Paul Groth. *MeasEval: Extracting Counts and Measurements and their Related Contexts*. In Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2021), pages 306a316, Bangkok, Thailand, August 5a6, 2021.Since the MeasEval dataset is the primary dataset mentioned in the paper, I will summarize it accordingly.Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
