To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ViQuAE: A Dataset for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering about Named Entities" by Paul Lerner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces ViQuAE, a novel dataset for knowledge-based visual question answering, which indicates that a dataset is present.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of visual question answering and mention the need for a dataset. They explicitly state that they provide a new dataset, ViQuAE, which consists of 3,700 questions paired with images, annotated using a semi-automatic method. This is a clear indication that ViQuAE is the primary dataset of interest.In the **methodology section**, the authors provide more details about ViQuAE, including its composition of 3,700 questions and the annotation process. They also mention that the dataset is associated with a knowledge base composed of 1.5 million Wikipedia articles paired with images, which further confirms the dataset's significance.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for ViQuAE. The authors reference their own work and the TriviaQA dataset, which is used for annotation. The citation for ViQuAE is:> Paul Lerner, Olivier Ferret, Camille Guinaudeau, Hervé Le Borgne, Romaric Besançon, Jose G Moreno, Jesús Lovén, Melgarejo. *ViQuAE: A Dataset for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering about Named Entities*. In Actes de la 29e Conférence sur le Traitement Automatique des Langues Naturelles, Avignon, France, 27 juin au 1er juillet 2022, Volume 1: conférence principale, pages 434a444. Cette Auvre est mise à disposition sous licence Attribution 4.0 International.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for ViQuAE, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the dataset details and provide a comprehensive overview of ViQuAE, along with its citation.
