To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging SE(3) Equivariance for Self-Supervised Category-Level Object Pose Estimation" by Xiaolong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled **Datasets and Evaluation**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:1. **ModelNet40**: This dataset is used for evaluating the method on complete shape point clouds from five categories (airplane, car, chair, sofa, and bottle). The authors mention that they follow the original train/test split from the ModelNet40 dataset.2. **NOCS-REAL 275**: This dataset is utilized for evaluating the method on real-world depth point clouds, specifically focusing on partial object depth point clouds. The authors note that the dataset contains a synthetic training set with 275K discrete frames generated from 1085 object models in various classes.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is: > Zhirong Wu, Shuran Song, Aditya Khosla, Fisher Yu, Linguang Zhang, Xiaoou Tang, and Jianxiong Xiao. *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1912a1920, 2015.- For **NOCS-REAL 275**, the citation is: > He Wang, Srinath Sridhar, Jingwei Huang, Julien Valentin, Shuran Song, and Leonidas J. Guibas. *Normalized Object Coordinate Space for Category-Level 6D Object Pose and Size Estimation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2642a2651, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
