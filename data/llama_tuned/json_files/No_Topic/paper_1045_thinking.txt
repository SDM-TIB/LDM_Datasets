To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Animacy Classification" by Samuel R. Bowman and Harshit Chopra, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained a discriminative classifier on an annotated corpus of spoken English, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to gather more details about the dataset. The authors mention that the corpus is an "animacy-annotated subset of the hand-parsed Switchboard corpus," which is a significant clue. I will look for more specific details about this dataset in the **methods section**.In the **methods section**, the authors describe the dataset in detail, stating that it consists of about 110,000 sentences with approximately 300,000 noun phrases (NPs). They also mention that the dataset is divided into training, development, and test sets, which further confirms its structure.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the original work by Zaenen et al. (2004) as the source of the animacy-annotated corpus. The citation for this dataset is:> A. Zaenen, "Animacy encoding in English: why and how," In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics Workshop on Discourse Annotation, 2004.Since the paper does not provide a specific name for the dataset, I will refer to it as the "animacy-annotated subset of the hand-parsed Switchboard corpus."The citation for the Switchboard corpus is:> S. Calhoun, J. Carletta, J.M. Brenier, N. Mayo, D. Jurafsky, M. Steedman, and D. Beaver. "The NXT-format Switchboard Corpus." Language resources and evaluation, 44(4), 2010.With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. The dataset entry will include the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
