To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simultaneous Object Detection and Ranking with Weak Supervision" by Matthew B. Blaschko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention using the **INRIA pedestrian detection dataset** and the **PASCAL VOC dataset** for their experiments. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial to the research.I will then look into the **results section** to confirm the datasets used for validation. The authors explicitly state that they validated their method on the INRIA dataset and the PASCAL VOC dataset, which reinforces their importance in the study.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **INRIA pedestrian detection dataset**, the citation is: > N. Dalal and B. Triggs. *Histogram of Oriented Gradients for Human Detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, volume 2, pages 886a893, 2005.2. For the **PASCAL VOC dataset**, the citation is: > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2007 (VOC2007) Results*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision, 2007.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
