To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Optimization for Heterogeneous Networks" by Tian Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the framework and its evaluation, which suggests that datasets are likely included in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention several datasets, including:1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, used for evaluating the proposed framework.2. **Federated Extended MNIST (FEMNIST)**: An extension of the MNIST dataset, curated for federated learning tasks.3. **Synthetic datasets**: The authors created synthetic datasets to test the effect of statistical heterogeneity on convergence. They describe three synthetic datasets generated with specific parameters to control the heterogeneity of the data.4. **Federated MNIST***: A variant of the MNIST dataset, used for evaluating the proposed framework in a federated setting.5. **The Complete Works of William Shakespeare**: A dataset built from the works of William Shakespeare, used for non-convex models.6. **Sentiment140**: A dataset for text sentiment analysis, used for evaluating the proposed framework in non-convex settings.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **MNIST**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.- For **Federated Extended MNIST (FEMNIST)**, the citation is: > G. Cohen, S. Afshar, J. Tapson, and A. van Schaik. *EMNIST: An extension of MNIST to handwritten letters*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.05373, 2017.- For **Synthetic datasets**, the authors describe them but do not provide a formal citation since they are generated for the purpose of this study. However, I will note that they are synthetic and do not have a formal citation.- For **The Complete Works of William Shakespeare**, the citation is: > H. B. McMahan, E. Moore, D. Ramage, S. Hampson, and B. Arcas. *Communication-eficient learning over decentralized data*. In International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, 2017.- For **Sentiment140**, the citation is: > A. Go, R. Bhayani, and L. Huang. *Twitter sentiment classification using distant supervision*. CS224N Project Report, Stanford, 1(12), 2009.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
