To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Feature Distance as an MR Image Reconstruction Quality Metric" by Philip M. Adamson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a self-supervised learning approach for MR image reconstruction, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of accelerated MRI reconstruction.Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically **section 2.1 (Dataset and Supervised Reconstruction Models)**, where the authors describe the datasets used. Here, they mention the **fastMRI knee dataset**. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, as it provides both sparse and fully acquired k-space data from a multi-coil MRI scanner.In the same section, the authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of slices and the resolution. They also mention that reference images were computed from the fully-sampled k-space data using the JSENSE method. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's context and its application in their research.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **fastMRI knee dataset**. The citation is as follows:> Florian Knoll, Jure Zbontar, Anuroop Sriram, Matthew J Muckley, Mary Bruno, Aaron Defazio, Marc Parente, Krzysztof J Geras, Joe Katsnelson, Hersh Chandarana, Zizhao Zhang, Michal Drozdalv, Adriana Romero, Michael Rabbat, Pascal Vincent, James Pinkerton, Duo Wang, Naissa Yakubova, Erich Owens, C Lawrence Zitnick, Michael P Recht, Daniel K Sodickson, and Yvonne W Lui. *fastMRI: A publicly available raw k-space and DICOM dataset of knee images for accelerated MR image reconstruction using machine learning*. Radiology Artificial Intelligence, 2(1):e190007, Jan 2020.With this information, I can now summarize the dataset details and prepare to create the dataset entry in the required format. The dataset entry will include the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
