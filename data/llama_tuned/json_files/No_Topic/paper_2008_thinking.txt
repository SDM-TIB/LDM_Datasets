To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Atypical Inputs in Educational Applications" by Su-Youn Yoon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of automated scoring systems and mentions the use of filtering models, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of atypical inputs in educational assessments but does not provide specific dataset names. I will continue to the **methods section** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for their experiments.In the **methods section**, the authors describe two automated scoring systems: **e-rater** for essay scoring and **SpeechRaterSM** for spoken responses. They mention that they collected 6,000 responses from 1,000 test-takers for the **SpeechRaterSM** system. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find the full citation for it.I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors reference any datasets used for evaluation or analysis. They mention that the dataset includes responses annotated by expert human raters, which suggests that it is a dataset used for scoring and evaluation.Now, I will look for the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific dataset name in the references, but they mention that the dataset consists of 6,000 responses from 1,000 test-takers. However, they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is based on their own collection of responses but does not have a formal citation.Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset name or citation, I will summarize the findings as follows:1. **SpeechRaterSM Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 6,000 responses from 1,000 test-takers, annotated by expert human raters for evaluating the performance of the SpeechRaterSM system. However, the paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset.Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, noting that while the paper discusses datasets, it does not provide formal citations for them. This will help in understanding the datasets used in the research without being able to provide full citations.
