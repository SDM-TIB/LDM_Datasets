To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Population Matching Discrepancy and Applications in Deep Learning" by Jianfei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method (Population Matching Discrepancy, PMD) in deep learning tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **Office dataset** for domain adaptation and the **MNIST, SVHN, and LFW datasets** for generative modeling tasks. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets used:1. **Office Dataset**: This dataset is used for domain adaptation tasks, containing images from three domains: amazon, dslr, and webcam.2. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.3. **SVHN Dataset**: A dataset for digit recognition, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, with a focus on natural images.4. **LFW Dataset**: A dataset for face recognition, containing 13,333 images for training and 5,000 for testing.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Office Dataset**, the citation is: > Kate Saenko, Brian Kulis, Mario Fritz, and Trevor Darrell. *Adapting visual category models to new domains*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV 2010), pages 213a226, 2010.- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, LAon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278a2324, 1998.- For the **SVHN Dataset**, the citation is: > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, volume 2011, page 5, 2011.- For the **LFW Dataset**, the citation is: > Gary B. Huang, Manu Ramesh, Tamara Berg, and Erik Learned-Miller. *Labeled faces in the wild: A database for studying face recognition in unconstrained environments*. Technical Report 07-49, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, October 2007.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
