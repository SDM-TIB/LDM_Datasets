To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meeting the 2020 Duolingo Challenge on a Shoestring" by Tadashi Nomoto, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors built two neural models, gFCONV and c-VAE, and mentions the use of a corpus constructed from the public dataset from Duolingo, which suggests that this is a key dataset.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods** sections for more detailed descriptions. In the introduction, the authors discuss the Duolingo Challenge and the need for data, confirming that the Duolingo dataset is central to their work.In the **methods section**, the authors describe how they created training data by randomly sampling pairs of sentences from the Duolingo dataset, resulting in a total of 4 million pairs of sentences. This indicates that the Duolingo dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Duolingo dataset. The relevant citation is:- For the **Duolingo dataset**, the citation is: > S. Mayhew, K. Bicknell, C. Brust, B. McDowell, W. Monroe, and B. Settles. *Simultaneous translation and paraphrase for language education*. In Proceedings of the ACL Workshop on Neural Generation and Translation (WNGT), 2020.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Duolingo dataset as it is the only dataset referenced in the paper.
