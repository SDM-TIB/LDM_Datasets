To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Contrastive Claims with Semantic Edits" by Christopher Hidey and Kathleen McKeown, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a dataset of 1,083,520 contrastive comment pairs from Reddit, which is a strong indication that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **data section** (section 3) where the authors describe the dataset collection process. They mention two datasets:1. **Reddit Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,083,520 contrastive comment pairs drawn from Reddit, filtered to include only pairs where the respondent has significantly modified the original post. The authors provide details about the filtering process and the types of responses included in the dataset.2. **Mechanical Turk Dataset**: This dataset includes 2,625 pairs of comments, where annotators were required to rate responses on fluency, coherence, and contrast. The authors specify that these pairs were generated from the Mechanical Turk platform.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:- For the **Reddit Dataset**, the citation is: > Christopher Hidey and Kathleen McKeown. *Generating Contrastive Claims with Semantic Edits*. In Proceedings of NAACL-HLT 2019, pages 1756a1767, 2019.- For the **Mechanical Turk Dataset**, the citation is: > Christopher Hidey and Kathleen McKeown. *Generating Contrastive Claims with Semantic Edits*. In Proceedings of NAACL-HLT 2019, pages 1756a1767, 2019.Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
