To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building Monolingual Word Alignment Corpus for the Greater China Region" by Fan Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed two monolingual word alignment corpora, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to gather more context about the datasets. The authors mention that they constructed two corpora: one from 30 million sentence pairs from Wikipedia and another from a manually annotated 12,000 sentence pairs from Wikipedia and news websites. This suggests that these are the datasets used in their research.In the **methods section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets. The authors describe the first corpus as a 11,623-triple GCR word dictionary corpus, which is automatically extracted and manually annotated from 30 million sentence pairs from Wikipedia. The second corpus is a manually annotated 12,000 sentence pairs GCR word alignment corpus obtained from Wikipedia and news websites. This confirms the datasets used in their experiments.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **GCR word dictionary corpus**, the citation is: > Fan Xu, Xiongfei Xu, Mingwen Wang, Maoxi Li. *Building Monolingual Word Alignment Corpus for the Greater China Region*. In Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Language Technology for Closely Related Languages, Varieties and Dialects, pages 85a94, Hissar, Bulgaria, September 10, 2015.2. For the **GCR word alignment corpus**, the citation is: > Fan Xu, Xiongfei Xu, Mingwen Wang, Maoxi Li. *Building Monolingual Word Alignment Corpus for the Greater China Region*. In Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Language Technology for Closely Related Languages, Varieties and Dialects, pages 85a94, Hissar, Bulgaria, September 10, 2015.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
