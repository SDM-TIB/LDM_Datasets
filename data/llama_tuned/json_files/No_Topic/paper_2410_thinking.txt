To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cluster Labeling by Word Embeddings and WordNet as Hypernymy" by Hanieh Poostchi and Massimo Piccardi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using the **WebAP document dataset**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their research.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They explicitly mention the **WebAP dataset** as the document collection used for their experiments. This dataset is described as containing 6,399 documents with a total of 1,959,777 sentences, which is crucial information for understanding its scope.In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that the **WebAP dataset** is the primary dataset utilized for their evaluations, which reinforces its importance in their research.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **WebAP dataset**. The citation is as follows:> M. Keikha, J. H. Park, W. B. Croft, and M. Sanderson. *Retrieving Passages and Finding Answers*. In Proceedings of the 2014 Australasian Document Computing Symposium (ADCS), pages 81a84, 2014.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **WebAP dataset**. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
