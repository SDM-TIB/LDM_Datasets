To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying Cleartext in Historical Ciphers" by Maria-Elena Gambardella et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors investigate the automatic distinction of cleartext from ciphertext in historical ciphers, which suggests that datasets related to historical ciphers are likely included.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the DECODE database, which is a collection of historical ciphers and keys. This is a strong indication that this database is a key dataset used in their research.In the **methods section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They mention the DECODE database again, specifically stating that it contains over 400 ciphers with their transcriptions, which is crucial for their experiments. Additionally, they refer to the Borg cipher and the Copiale cipher, which are also datasets relevant to their study.I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors provide any additional datasets or confirm the use of the DECODE database in their experiments.Now, I will consult the **references section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:1. For the **DECODE database**, the citation is: > ASV. *The DECODE database: Collection of historical ciphers and keys*. In The 2nd International Conference on Historical Cryptology, HistoCrypt 2019, June 23-26 2019, Mons, Belgium, pages 69a78.2. For the **Borg cipher**, the citation is: > Aldarrab, N., Knight, K., and Megyesi, B. *The Borg cipher*. https://cl.lingfil.uu.se/Ebea/borg. Accessed: 2020-01-31.3. For the **Copiale cipher**, the citation is: > The Copiale Cipher. https://cl.lingfil.uu.se/Ebea/copiale. Accessed: 2020-01-31.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
