To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Representation Balancing Offline Model-Based Reinforcement Learning" by Byung-Jun Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges in offline reinforcement learning and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **D4RL benchmark**, which is a well-known dataset in reinforcement learning. I will look for specific datasets within this benchmark.In the **experiments section**, the authors list the datasets used for their offline model-based reinforcement learning experiments. They mention the following datasets from the D4RL benchmark:1. **Random**: Contains 106 experience tuples from a random policy.2. **Medium**: Contains 106 experience tuples from a policy trained to approximate 1/3 the performance of the expert.3. **Med-Replay**: Contains 105 experience tuples from the replay buffer of a policy trained up to the performance of the medium agent.4. **Med-Expert**: A combination of the Medium dataset with 106 samples from the expert.Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The D4RL benchmark is referenced as follows:- For the **D4RL benchmark**, the citation is: > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Oir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. *D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citation is included for each one.
