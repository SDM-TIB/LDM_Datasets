To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adapting the PULS Event Extraction Framework to Analyze Russian Text" by Lidia Pivovarova and Mian Du, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper focuses on extending the PULS framework for Russian-language text analysis, which suggests that datasets related to Russian text may be involved.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors discuss the challenges of information extraction in Russian and mention the use of a test corpus for evaluation, which indicates that a dataset is likely included.In the **methods section**, I will look for specific datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention using a test corpus of 64 Russian-language documents for the security scenario and a test corpus of 75 Russian documents for the epidemics scenario. This suggests that these documents are part of the datasets used in their experiments.I will also check the **evaluation section** to confirm the datasets used for testing the performance of the Russian-language IE system. The authors provide details about the number of events extracted and the evaluation metrics, which reinforces the datasets' relevance.Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references a freely available comparable news corpus, which is crucial for understanding the datasets used in their experiments. The citation for this corpus is:- For the **comparable news corpus**, the citation is: > Klementiev, A., & Roth, D. (2006). Weakly supervised named entity transliteration and discovery from multilingual comparable corpora. In Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Computational Linguistics and the 44th annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Sydney, Australia.The authors also mention using a test corpus for the security scenario, which is described as a collection of 64 Russian-language documents, and another for the epidemics scenario, consisting of 75 Russian documents. However, these are not formal datasets with citations, as they are derived from the comparable news corpus and the authors' own annotations.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets identified. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
