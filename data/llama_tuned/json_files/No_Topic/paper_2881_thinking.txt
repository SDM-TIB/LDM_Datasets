To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DISENTANGLING ADVERSARIAL ROBUSTNESS IN DI-RECTIONS OF THE DATA MANIFOLD" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the study of adversarial robustness in the context of generative models, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using the **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets for their experiments. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their research.I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **MNIST**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, LAon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278a2324, 1998.- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
