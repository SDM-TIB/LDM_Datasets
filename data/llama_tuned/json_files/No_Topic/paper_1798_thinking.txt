To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Pipeline for Zero-Shot Data-to-Text Generation" by William Anders et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a synthetic corpus and two major triple-to-text datasets, indicating that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the need for datasets in data-to-text generation. They refer to a synthetic corpus called **WIKIFLUENT**, which is built from English Wikipedia, and two specific datasets: **WebNLG** and **E2E**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.In the **methodology section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets. They describe **WebNLG** as containing RDF triples from DBPedia and their crowdsourced descriptions, while **E2E** consists of restaurant recommendations in the form of attribute-value pairs. This information is essential for understanding how these datasets are utilized in their experiments.Now, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets' roles in the evaluation process. The authors mention using these datasets for testing their proposed approach, which reinforces their importance in the research.Next, I will consult the **references section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:1. For **WebNLG**, the citation is: > Claire Gardent, Anastasia Shimorina, Shashi Narayan, and Laura Perez-Beltrachini. *The WebNLG challenge: Generating text from RDF data*. In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Natural Language Generation, pages 124a133, 2017.2. For **E2E**, the citation is: > Jekaterina Novikova, Ondrej DuAek, and Verena Rieser. *The E2E Dataset: New Challenges for End-to-End Generation*. In Proceedings of the 18th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue, pages 201a206, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
