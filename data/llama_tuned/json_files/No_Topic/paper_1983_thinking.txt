To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FII_CROSS at SemEval-2021 Task 2: Multilingual and Cross-lingual Word-in-Context Disambiguation" by Ciprian Bodnar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used datasets from SemEval 2021 Task 2, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **datasets and methods section**. Here, the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the dataset is released in JSON format and includes various language pairs, specifically:1. **SemEval-2021 Task 2 Dataset**: This dataset is used for multilingual and cross-lingual word-in-context disambiguation tasks. It contains 20,000 words across five languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, and Russian. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with specific numbers of entries for each language pair.The authors also describe the structure of the dataset, including the types of information it contains, such as unique IDs, target lemmas, parts of speech, sentences, and specific tags for disambiguation.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SemEval-2021 Task 2 dataset. The relevant citation is:- For **SemEval-2021 Task 2 Dataset**, the citation is: > F. Martelli, N. Kalach, G. Tola, and R. Navigli. *SemEval-2021 Task 2: Multilingual and Cross-lingual Word-in-Context Disambiguation (MCL-WiC)*. In Proceedings of the 15th Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2021.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference.In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the SemEval-2021 Task 2 dataset, which is used for multilingual and cross-lingual word-in-context disambiguation tasks. I will now prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
