To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Link Weight Prediction with Node Embeddings" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of deep learning for link weight prediction, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a subsection that details the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the context of their experiments, including:1. **Airport Dataset**: This dataset consists of 500 busiest airports in the United States, with 5960 edges weighted by the number of passengers traveling between them.2. **Authors Dataset**: This dataset contains 16726 authors, with 47594 edges weighted by the number of papers posted by two authors to the Condensed Matter section of the arXiv E-Print Archive between 1995 and 1999.3. **Collaboration Dataset**: This dataset represents 226 nations on Earth, with 20616 edges weighted by the number of academic papers whose author lists include that pair of nations.4. **Congress Dataset**: This dataset includes 163 committees in the 102nd United States Congress, with 26569 edges weighted by the number of shared members.5. **Facebook Dataset**: This dataset consists of 899 users of a Facebook-like forum, with 71380 edges weighted by the number of messages posted by two users on the same topics.6. **Forum Dataset**: This dataset represents 1899 users of a student social network at UC Irvine, with 20291 edges weighted by the number of messages sent between users.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For the **Airport Dataset**, the citation is: > Vittoria Colizza, Romualdo Pastor-Satorras, and Alessandro Vespignani. *Reaction-diffusion processes and metapopulation models in heterogeneous networks*. Nature Physics, 3(4):276a282, 2007.- For the **Authors Dataset**, the citation is: > Mark EJ Newman. *The structure of scientific collaboration networks*. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 98(2):404a409, 2001.- For the **Collaboration Dataset**, the citation is: > Raj Kumar Pan, Kimmo Kaski, and Santo Fortunato. *World citation and collaboration networks: uncovering the role of geography in science*. Scientific Reports, 2, 2012.- For the **Congress Dataset**, the citation is: > Mason A Porter, Peter J Mucha, Mark EJ Newman, and Casey M Warmbrand. *A network analysis of committees in the US House of Representatives*. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 102(20):7057a7062, 2005.- For the **Facebook Dataset**, the citation is: > Tore Opsahl. *Triadic closure in two-mode networks: Redefining the global and local clustering coefficients*. Social Networks, 35(2):159a167, 2013.- For the **Forum Dataset**, the citation is: > Tore Opsahl and Pietro Panzarasa. *Clustering in weighted networks*. Social Networks, 31(2):155a163, 2009.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
