To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Protecting Proprietary Data: Poisoning for Secure Dataset Release" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a data poisoning method but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the use of **ImageNet** and **CIFAR-10** for their experiments, indicating that these datasets are crucial for their methodology. I will look for more details about these datasets in the experiments section.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they conducted their experiments on **ImageNet** and **CIFAR-10**. They describe the datasets as follows:1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification, containing over 1 million images across 1000 classes.2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 50,000 images across 10 classes, commonly used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **ImageNet**, the citation is: > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., Berg, A. C., and Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. Int J Comput Vis, 115(3):211a252, December 2015. ISSN 1573-1405. doi: 10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is: > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
