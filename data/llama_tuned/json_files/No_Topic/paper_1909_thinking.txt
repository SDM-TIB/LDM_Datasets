To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Adapter at SemEval-2021 Task 10: Entropy-based Pseudo-Labeler for Source-free Domain Adaptation" by Sangwon Yoon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed methods are evaluated on data provided by SemEval-2021 task 10, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the SemEval-2021 task 10, which is a strong indication that this task is associated with a dataset. I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. The authors state that they evaluate their methods on the dataset provided by SemEval-2021 task 10, but they do not provide a detailed description of the dataset. However, they mention that the development data consists of 1580 sentences and the test data consists of 3911 sentences, which gives me a sense of the dataset's scope.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more context about the datasets used. They specify that the development data is the annotated news portion of the SemEval-2018 Task 6 data, and the test data is a set of annotated documents extracted from food security warnings systems. This confirms the datasets used for evaluation.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **SemEval-2018 Task 6 data**, the citation is: > Egoitz Laparra, Dongfang Xu, Ahmed Elsayed, Steven Bethard, and Martha Palmer. *SemEval 2018 In Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pages 88a96*.2. For the **annotated news portion of the SemEval-2018 Task 6 data**, the citation is the same as above, as it is part of the same task.3. The **annotated documents extracted from food security warnings systems** is not a standard dataset with a formal citation, but it is described as part of the evaluation process. Since it is not a publicly available dataset with a specific citation, I will note it as such.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
