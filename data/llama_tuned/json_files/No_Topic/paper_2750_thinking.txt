To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Class Hierarchy for Code Comprehension" by Jiyang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the generation of comments for overriding methods, which suggests that datasets related to code and comments might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **dataset section** (section 4) where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they built a corpus by mining open-source Java projects, specifically detailing the structure of the dataset: it consists of tuples of method names, comments, and class names. The authors specify that they filtered out comments with non-English words and those with fewer than three words, indicating the dataset's preprocessing steps.In the **dataset description**, the authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of projects, first sentences, and full descriptions. They also mention that the dataset is partitioned into training, validation, and testing sets, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's application in their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the Javadoc API documentation, which is a key source for the dataset. The citation for the Javadoc API documentation is:> Oracle. *How to Write Doc Comments for the Javadoc Tool*. https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html#reusingcomments.Since the dataset is derived from the Javadoc API documentation, I will use this citation as the primary reference for the dataset.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and citation in a structured format for further processing or review. This will include the dataset's purpose, the number of examples, and the citation to ensure proper attribution.
