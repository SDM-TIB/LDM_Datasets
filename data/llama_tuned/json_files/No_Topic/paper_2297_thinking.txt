To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stylistic Approaches to Predicting Reddit Popularity in Diglossia" by Huikai Chua, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the author collected data from two Reddit subreddits, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **data collection section** (section 4.1) where the author describes the datasets used. Here, I find that the author collected data from the **Singaporean (SG) subreddit** and the **United Kingdom (UK) subreddit**. The author states that the data was scraped from these subreddits over a period of 3 years, which is crucial information for the dataset description.In the **data collection section**, the author provides details about the data collection process, including the time frame and the criteria for post selection. This section confirms that the datasets are Reddit posts from these two subreddits.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets in the references. Instead, it mentions the subreddits themselves, which are commonly referenced in the context of Reddit data. The citations for these subreddits are as follows:- For the **Singaporean subreddit**, the citation is: > Reddit. *r/singapore*. Available at: https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/.- For the **United Kingdom subreddit**, the citation is: > Reddit. *r/unitedkingdom*. Available at: https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/.Since the datasets are Reddit subreddits and not traditional datasets with formal citations, I will note that the datasets are publicly available and can be accessed through the Reddit website.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details such as the subreddit names and the context in which they were used in the research. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets utilized in the study.
