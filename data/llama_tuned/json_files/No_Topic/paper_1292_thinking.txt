To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Literary translation as a three-stage process: machine translation, post-editing and revision" by Lieve Macken et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of machine translation and post-editing in literary translations, which suggests that datasets related to these processes may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **method section**, specifically **section 3 (Method)**, where the authors describe the data they received from the company. Here, they mention that the data consists of an English novel and three Dutch translations, including machine translation, post-editing, and revised translations. This indicates that there is a dataset related to the translations, but I need to find the specific details.In the **method section**, the authors specify that the dataset includes 578 aligned segments (7,921 source words; 9,419 source tokens) from the first chapter of the English novel. This is a clear indication of a dataset used for their experiments.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that the data was received from a book translation company, but they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation in the references. However, I will look for any relevant citations related to the translations or the company they worked with.Since the paper does not provide a formal dataset name or citation, I will note that the dataset is based on the translations provided by the company, but I will not be able to provide a formal citation for it. Instead, I will summarize the dataset as follows:1. **Literary Translation Dataset**: This dataset consists of an English novel and three Dutch translations (machine translation, post-editing, and revised translations) with a total of 578 aligned segments (7,921 source words; 9,419 source tokens). The dataset is derived from a collaboration with a book translation company, but no formal citation is provided.Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I include the relevant details about the dataset and its source.
