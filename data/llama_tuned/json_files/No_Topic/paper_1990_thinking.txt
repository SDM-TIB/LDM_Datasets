To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Low Power, Fully Event-Based Gesture Recognition System" by Arnon Amir et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a new hand gesture dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is being introduced.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled "Dataset collection." Here, the authors describe the **DvsGesture dataset**, which is a newly collected dataset consisting of 1,342 instances of 11 hand and arm gestures collected from 29 subjects under different lighting conditions. This section provides detailed information about the dataset, including the number of instances, the types of gestures included, and the conditions under which they were collected.In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that the DvsGesture dataset is available at a specific URL, which is crucial for citation purposes. They also describe the dataset's characteristics, such as the number of trials and the types of gestures included.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DvsGesture dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:- For the **DvsGesture dataset**, the citation is: > Arnon Amir, Brian Taba, David Berg, Timothy Melano, Jeffrey McKinstry, Carmelo Di Nolfo, Tapan Nayak, Alexander Andreopoulos, Guillaume Garreau, Marcela Mendoza, Jeff Kusnitz, Michael Debole, Steve Esser, Tobi Delbrucka, Myron Flickner, and Dharmendra Modha. *A Low Power, Fully Event-Based Gesture Recognition System*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.Since the DvsGesture dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details.
