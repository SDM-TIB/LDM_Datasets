To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PDTB-style Discourse Annotation of Chinese Text" by Yuping Zhou and Nianwen Xue, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the discourse annotation scheme for Chinese, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections**. In the introduction, the authors reference the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) as a foundational framework for their work. This suggests that the PDTB may be a dataset used in their experiments.In the **methods section**, the authors describe their annotation scheme and mention that they conducted annotation experiments on a dataset consisting of 98 files taken from the Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005). This indicates that the Chinese Treebank is a dataset used for their experiments.I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used. The authors state that the dataset consists of 98 files from the Chinese Treebank, which is a clear indication of the dataset's name and its source.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the Chinese Treebank. The relevant citation is:- For the **Chinese Treebank**, the citation is: > Nianwen Xue, Fei Xia, Fu dong Chiou, and Martha Palmer. *The Penn Chinese TreeBank: PhraseStructure Annotation of a Large Corpus*. Natural Language Engineering, 11(2):207a238, 2005.Since the PDTB is mentioned in the introduction as a foundational framework, I will also include it in my extraction. The citation for the PDTB is:- For the **Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB)**, the citation is: > Rashmi Prasad, Eleni Miltsakaki, Nikhil Dinesh, Alan Lee, Aravind Joshi, Livio Robaldo, and Bonnie Webber. *The Penn Discourse Treebank 2.0 Annotation Manual*. The PDTB Research Group, December 2007.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both the Chinese Treebank and the PDTB. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
