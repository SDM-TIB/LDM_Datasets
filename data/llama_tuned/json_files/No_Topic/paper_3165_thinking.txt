To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Event Temporal Relation Classification via Auxiliary Label-Aware Contrastive Learning" by Tiesen Sun and Lishuang Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the Temporal Semantic Information (TSI) framework and mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on two datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:1. **TB-Dense**: This dataset is described as a densely annotated dataset for Event Temporal Relation Classification (ETRC), annotated based on TimeBank. It includes 6 temporal relations (AFTER, BEFORE, INCLUDE, IS INCLUDED, VAGUE, SIMULTANEOUS) and is split into training, development, and test sets.2. **MATRES**: This dataset is refined from 275 documents in TimeBank and TempEval, featuring a multi-axis annotation scheme for event temporal relations. It includes 4 temporal relations (BEFORE, AFTER, EQUAL, VAGUE) and also follows a specific split strategy for training and testing.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **TB-Dense**, the citation is: > Taylor Cassidy, Bill McDowell, Nathanael Chambers, and Steven Bethard. *An annotation framework for dense event ordering*. In ACL (Volume 2: Short Papers), pages 501a506, 2014.- For **MATRES**, the citation is: > Qiang Ning, Hao Wu, and Dan Roth. *A multi-axis annotation scheme for event temporal relations*. In ACL (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1318a1328, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their respective citations.
