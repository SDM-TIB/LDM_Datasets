To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Re-ranking Meets Morphosyntax: State-of-the-art Results from the SPMRL 2013 Shared Task" by Anders Björkelund et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the SPMRL 2013 Shared Task, which suggests that datasets related to parsing morphologically rich languages (MRLs) are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention participating in the SPMRL 2013 Shared Task. They refer to the use of various datasets for their experiments, but I need to find specific names and details.In the **methodology section**, particularly in the subsections related to preprocessing and parsing, the authors describe their data sources. They mention using datasets from the Shared Task, specifically referencing the **CoNLL09 format** and the **Penn Arabic Treebank** for Arabic, **Basque Dependency Treebank** for Basque, and **French Treebank** for French. They also mention the **Hungarian Dependency Treebank**, **Korean Treebank**, **Polish Treebank**, and **Swedish Treebank** for their respective languages.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as follows:1. **Penn Arabic Treebank**: > Nizar Habash, Reem Faraj, and Ryan Roth. *CITI Arabic Treebank*. In Proceedings of the ACL-IJCNLP 2009 Conference Short Papers, pages 221a224, Suntec, Singapore, August 2009.2. **Basque Dependency Treebank**: > I. Aduriz, M. J. Aranzabe, J. M. Arriola, A. Atutxa, A. Díaz de Ilarraza, A. Garmendia, and M. Oronoz. *Construction of a Basque dependency treebank*. In TLT-03, pages 201a204, 2003.3. **French Treebank**: > Anne Abeillé, Lionel Clement, and François Toussenel. *Building a treebank for French*. In Anne 2003.4. **Hungarian Dependency Treebank**: > Dára Csendes, Janos Csirik, Tibor Gyimóthy, and András Kocsor. *The Szeged treebank*. In VA aclav Ma-toušek, Pavel Mautner, and Tomás Pavelka, editors, Text, Speech and Dialogue: Proceedings of TSD 2005, Springer, 2005.5. **Korean Treebank**: > Jinho D. Choi. *Preparing Korean data for the shared task on parsing morphologically rich languages*. ArXiv e-prints, 2013.6. **Polish Treebank**: > Marek A. Swidziński and Marcin Woliński. *Towards a bank of constituent parse trees for Polish*. In Speech and Dialogue: 13th International Conference (TSD), Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, pages 197a204, Springer, 2010.7. **Swedish Treebank**: > Rickard Domeij, Ola Knutsson, Johan Carlberger, and Viggo Kann. *Granska: an efficient hybrid system for Swedish grammar checking*. In Proceedings of the 12th Nordic Conference in Computational Linguistics, 2000.After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.
