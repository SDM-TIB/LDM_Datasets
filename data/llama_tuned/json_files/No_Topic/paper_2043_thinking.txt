To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting the Compositionality of Nominal Compounds: Giving Word Embeddings a Hard Time" by Silvio Cordeiro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted a large-scale multilingual evaluation of distributional semantic models (DSMs) for predicting the degree of semantic compositionality of nominal compounds, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, specifically the subsection titled **Compositionality Datasets**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:1. **Reddy Dataset**: This dataset contains compositionality judgments for 90 compounds and their individual word components, collected with Mechanical Turk. It includes a scale of literality from 0 (idiomatic) to 5 (literal).2. **Reddy++ Dataset**: An extension of the Reddy dataset, it includes an additional 90 English nominal compounds, totaling 180 entries, also collected through Mechanical Turk.3. **Farahmand Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1042 English compounds extracted from Wikipedia with binary non-compositional judgments by four experts.4. **FR-comp Dataset**: A new resource created for this evaluation, it contains 180 adjective-noun and noun-adjective compounds in French, collected through crowdsourcing.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Reddy Dataset**, the citation is: > Siva Reddy, Diana McCarthy, and Suresh Manandhar. *An empirical study on compositionality in compound nouns*. In Proceedings of The 5th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing 2011 (IJCNLP 2011), Chiang Mai, Thailand, November.- For the **Reddy++ Dataset**, the citation is: > Carlos Ramisch, Silvio Cordeiro, Leonardo Zilio, Marco Idiart, Aline Villavicencio, and Rodrigo Wilkens. *How naked is the naked truth? A multilingual lexicon of nominal compound compositionality*. In Proceedings of the 55th ACL (Volume 2: Short Papers), Berlin, Germany, August.- For the **Farahmand Dataset**, the citation is: > Meghdad Farahmand, Aaron Smith, and Joakim Nivre. *A multiword expression dataset: Annotating non-compositionality and conventionalization for English noun compounds*. In Proceedings of the 11th Workshop on Multiword Expressions, pages 29a33, Denver, Colorado, June.- For the **FR-comp Dataset**, the citation is: > Carlos Ramisch, Silvio Cordeiro, Leonardo Zilio, Marco Idiart, Aline Villavicencio, and Rodrigo Wilkens. *How naked is the naked truth? A multilingual lexicon of nominal compound compositionality*. In Proceedings of the 55th ACL (Volume 2: Short Papers), Berlin, Germany, August.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
