To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Design of BCCWJ-EEG: Balanced Corpus with Human Electroencephalography" by Yohei Osekia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese (BCCWJ)** and mentions that it is experimentally annotated with human electroencephalography (EEG), indicating that this is a dataset of interest.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methodology sections** to gather more details about the datasets. In the introduction, the authors discuss the limitations of existing language resources and highlight the need for a balanced corpus. They mention several existing datasets, including the **Dundee Corpus**, **Potsdam Sentence Corpus**, **Natural Stories Corpus**, **Ghent Eye-Tracking Corpus**, **UCL Corpus**, **Alice Corpus**, and **Zurich Cognitive Language Processing Corpus**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to their work.In the **methodology section**, the authors provide more specific details about the **BCCWJ-EEG** dataset, describing it as a balanced corpus composed of 100 million Japanese words and its experimental annotation with EEG data. They also mention the **BCCWJ-EyeTrack** and **BCCWJ-EyeTrack** datasets, which are subsets of the BCCWJ corpus for eye-tracking and self-paced reading tasks.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. **Dundee Corpus**: > Kennedy, A., & Pynte, J.

This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
