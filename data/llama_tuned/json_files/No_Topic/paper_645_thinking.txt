To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Annotating and Analyzing Biased Sentences in News Articles using Crowdsourcing" by Sora Lim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a novel news bias dataset, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods** sections, where the authors describe their dataset in detail. They mention that their dataset consists of 966 sentences from 46 English-language news articles covering four different events, which is a clear indication of the dataset's content.In the **methods section**, the authors provide more details about the dataset, including how it was constructed and annotated. They mention that the dataset contains labels concerning bias on the sentence level, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's purpose and structure.Now, I will look for the **dataset description** in the paper. The authors provide a detailed description of their dataset, including the number of sentences, news articles, and the labeling process. This information is essential for creating a comprehensive entry for the dataset.In the **references section**, I will check for any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors reference several existing datasets in the field of news bias detection, which may be relevant for context or comparison. However, the primary focus is on their own dataset, so I will ensure to include the citation for their dataset.After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and citation. The dataset entry will be structured to include the dataset's purpose, characteristics, and how it can be used in future research.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for output, ensuring that it is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
