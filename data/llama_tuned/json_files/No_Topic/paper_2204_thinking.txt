To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Entity Disambiguation with Web Links" by Andrew Chisholm and Ben Hachey, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors explore the use of web links for entity disambiguation, which suggests that datasets related to entity linking are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the use of Wikipedia and related semantic resources, which implies that datasets related to Wikipedia may be referenced later in the paper. In the **experiments section**, they explicitly mention two datasets used for their evaluations:1. **CoNLL Dataset**: This dataset is a corpus of Reuters newswire annotated for whole-document named entity recognition and disambiguation. It is a well-known benchmark in the field of natural language processing.2. **TAC 2010 Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) and includes a large collection of news articles and web log data for entity linking tasks. It is used for evaluating entity linking systems.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **CoNLL Dataset**, the citation is: > Johannes Hoffart, Mohamed Amir Yosef, Ilaria Bordino, Hagen FÃ¤rstenau, Manfred Pinkal, Marc Spaniol, Bilyana Taneva, Stefan Thater, and Gerhard Weikum. *Robust disambiguation of named entities in text*. In Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 782a792, 2011.- For the **TAC 2010 Dataset**, the citation is: > Heng Ji and Ralph Grishman. *Knowledge base population: Successful approaches and challenges*. In Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 1148a1158, 2011.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
