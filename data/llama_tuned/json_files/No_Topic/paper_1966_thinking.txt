To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Depth-Aware Stereo Video Retargeting" by Bing Lia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of stereo video retargeting and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their method. In this section, they mention using the **CVW dataset** for performance comparison with existing methods. This indicates that the CVW dataset is a key dataset for their experiments.I will also check the **related work section** to see if any other datasets are referenced. The authors mention that they tested their method on various test videos, but they do not specify additional datasets in this section. Therefore, I will focus on the CVW dataset for now.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more details about the CVW dataset, stating that it contains various types of motions and salient objects with a large depth range, which are suitable for their experiments. They also mention that they tested their method on more challenging videos, but again, the CVW dataset is the primary dataset used for evaluation.Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the CVW dataset. The citation for the CVW dataset is:- For **CVW dataset**, the citation is: > S.-S. Lin, C.-H. Lin, Y.-H. Kuo, and T.-Y. Lee. *Consistent volumetric warping using ioating boundaries for stereo video retargeting*. IEEE Trans. Circuits Syst. Video Technol., 8: 1-10, 2015.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CVW dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the CVW dataset, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
