To extract datasets from the research paper titled "fokas: Formerly Known As A Search Engine Incorporating Named Entity Evolution" by Helge Holzmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use the **New York Times corpus**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their research.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional datasets or context. The authors mention the **New York Times corpus** again, confirming its significance in their work.In the **methodology section**, I will look for specific details about how the datasets are utilized. The authors state that they use the **New York Times corpus** for their experiments, which is a clear indication that this is the primary dataset they rely on.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **New York Times corpus**. The citation is as follows:> Tahmasebi, N., Gossen, G., Kanhabua, N., Holzmann, H., & Risse, T. (2012). Named entity evolution dataset. Available online at http://l3s.de/neer-dataset/.This citation is crucial as it provides the necessary information to describe the dataset.Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the details I have gathered:1. **New York Times Corpus**: - **dcterms:creator**: Tahmasebi, N., Gossen, G., Kanhabua, N., Holzmann, H., & Risse, T. - **dcterms:description**: A corpus with a 20-year timespan and many name changes, used for demonstrating named entity evolution recognition. - **dcterms:title**: New York Times Corpus - **dcterms:issued**: 2012 - **dcterms:language**: English - **dcterms:identifier**: http://l3s.de/neer-dataset/ - **dcat:theme**: Named Entity Evolution, Information Retrieval - **dcat:keyword**: Named Entity Recognition, Temporal Co-references, Search Engine - **dcat:landingPage**: http://l3s.de/neer-dataset/ - **dcterms:hasVersion**: - **dcterms:format**: Text - **mls:task**: Named Entity Evolution RecognitionAfter gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
