To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Generative Models with the Upprop Algorithm" by JongHoon Oh and H Sebastian Seung, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the Upprop algorithm and its application to handwritten digit recognition, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention that their experiments were conducted on images of handwritten digits, which indicates that a specific dataset is being used. I will look for details about the dataset in the **experiments section**.Here, the authors explicitly mention that they used the **USPS database**, which consists of example images of handwritten digits. They describe the preprocessing steps and the performance metrics, confirming that this is the dataset used for their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide additional details about the USPS database, including the number of training and testing images, the normalization process, and the performance comparison with PCA. This reinforces the significance of the USPS dataset in their research.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the USPS dataset. The citation is typically found in the references, and I will ensure to include it accurately.The citation for the USPS dataset is:> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the USPS dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
