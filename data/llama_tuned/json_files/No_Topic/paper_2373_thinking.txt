To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Interpretable Model with Transformation Equivariant Interpretation" by Yipei Wang and Xiaoqian Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a self-interpretable model, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention two datasets:1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for handwritten digit recognition tasks. The authors state that they implemented their method on the MNIST dataset, which indicates its significance in their experiments.2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset is a well-known dataset for image classification tasks, containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The authors also mention using CIFAR-10 for their experiments.I will now check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.htmlAfter gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
