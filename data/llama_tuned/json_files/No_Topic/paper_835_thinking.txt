To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disfluencies in anormala aging and Alzheimeras disease: segmental, suprasegmental and gestural markers" by Diane Caussade et al., I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves analyzing language productions in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, which suggests that there may be datasets related to language processing or speech data.Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention that the data was collected through two tasks: one with gestures and one without. This suggests that there may be specific datasets related to these tasks.In the **methods section**, the authors state that the data was collected using audio-visually recorded sessions, which implies that there are audio and video recordings involved. They also mention that the data includes transcriptions of the recordings, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's content.I will also look for any references to specific datasets or corpora used for analysis. The authors refer to the use of a "protocole original" and mention that the data was collected from a group of 10 participants with Alzheimer's disease and a control group. This indicates that there is a dataset related to the study, but I need to find the specific name and details.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific dataset name in the references, but they do mention the use of a "protocole original" and the participants' characteristics, such as their age and cognitive status. However, they do not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself.Since the paper does not explicitly mention a publicly available dataset, I will summarize the findings based on the information provided in the paper. The dataset appears to consist of audio-visually recorded sessions of 10 participants with Alzheimer's disease and a control group, but it does not have a formal citation.Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format, noting that while the paper discusses the dataset's characteristics, it does not provide a formal citation for it.
