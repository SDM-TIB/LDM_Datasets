To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WLSI-3/OIAF4HLT 2016: Third International Workshop on Worldwide Language Service Infrastructure and Second Workshop on Open Infrastructures and Analysis Frameworks for Human Language Technologies" by Yohei Murakami et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the workshop's focus on language service infrastructure and interoperability, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any datasets used in their research.Next, I will examine the **methodology or experiments section** to find any specific datasets utilized in the studies presented. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were applied in the research. If the paper includes a **results or discussion section**, I will look for any references to datasets that were used for evaluation or analysis.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily. If the paper does not provide specific dataset names, I will look for any mentions of datasets in the **conclusion** or **acknowledgments** sections, as authors may mention datasets used in their research.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
