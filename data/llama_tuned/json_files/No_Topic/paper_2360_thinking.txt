To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Twin Neural Networks: Maximizing Physics Recovery for Physical Systems" by Haoran Li and Yang Weng, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of synthetic datasets and real-world data, indicating that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention several datasets:1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors describe a synthetic dataset created for demonstration purposes, consisting of a 4-node system with specific equations. However, they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset as it is generated for the purpose of the study.2. **IEEE Power Systems and PJM Load Data**: This dataset includes standard power system models and real-world data from PJM Interconnection LLC. The authors reference the MATPOWER community for access to this dataset. The citation for this dataset is: > MATPOWER community. *MATPOWER*. 2020. https://matpower.org/.3. **Mass-damper system data**: This dataset is derived from a specific equation representing the governing law of the mass-damper system. The authors do not provide a formal citation for this dataset as it is based on a mathematical representation rather than a publicly available dataset.4. **UF sparse matrix-based system**: This dataset consists of a 274-node system and is referenced as part of the UFsparse matrix systems. The citation for this dataset is: > Texas A&M University. *Sparse matrix collection*. 2011. https://sparse.tamu.edu/.5. **PJM Load Data**: This dataset contains hourly electricity consumption data from PJM Interconnection LLC. The citation for this dataset is: > PJM Interconnection LLC. *Metered load data*. 2018. https://dataminer2.pjm.com/feed/hrl_load_metered/definition.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
