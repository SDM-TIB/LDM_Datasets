To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HIBOU: an eBook to improve Text Comprehension and Reading Fluency for Beginning Readers of French" by Ludivine Javourey-Drevet et al., I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the application HIBOU has been tested in six elementary schools in France, which suggests that there may be datasets related to the texts used in these evaluations.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methodology sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges faced by beginning readers in France and mention the use of simplified texts, but I need to look for specific datasets or corpora.In the **corpus and reading settings section**, the authors describe the ALECTOR corpus, which is a collection of 79 original texts in French along with their simplified versions. This is a clear indication that this corpus is a dataset used in their research.I will also check the **corpus and reading settings section** for more details about the dataset. The authors mention that the texts are part of the ALECTOR corpus, which is available online, and they provide a reference to the corpus's availability.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the ALECTOR corpus. The citation is as follows:> Gala, N., Tack, A., Javourey-Drevet, L., Fran√ßois, T., & Ziegler, J. C. (2020a, May). ALECTOR: A parallel corpus of simplified French texts with alignments of misreadings by poor and dyslexic readers. In Language Resources and Evaluation for Language Technologies (LREC). European Language Resources Association, Marseille, France, 1353-1361.Since the ALECTOR corpus is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
