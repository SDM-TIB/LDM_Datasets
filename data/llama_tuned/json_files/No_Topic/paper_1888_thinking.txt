To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multichannel LSTM-CNN for Telugu Technical Domain Identification" by Sunil Gundapu and Radhika Mamidi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.In the **dataset description section**, the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. They state that they utilized the dataset provided by the organizers of the ICON shared task, specifically Task-h of TechDOication 2020. This indicates that there is a specific dataset associated with this task.Next, I will look for detailed information about the dataset, including its size, structure, and any relevant statistics mentioned. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, such as the number of training, validation, and testing samples, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.In the **dataset description**, the authors specify that the dataset consists of 68,865 training samples, 5,920 validation samples, and 2,611 testing samples. This information is essential for describing the dataset's scale and application.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the ICON shared task, which is a key source for the dataset. The citation for the ICON shared task is:> ICON Shared Task. *TechDOication 2020*. Available at: https://techdoication.org/ Since the dataset is derived from this shared task, I will use this citation as the primary reference for the dataset.The dataset description is as follows:- **Dataset Name**: ICON shared task dataset for Task-h of TechDOication 2020- **Description**: This dataset consists of 68,865 training samples, 5,920 validation samples, and 2,611 testing samples, used for domain identification in Telugu text data.- **Citation**: ICON Shared Task. *TechDOication 2020*. Available at: https://techdoication.org/Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
