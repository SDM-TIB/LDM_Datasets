To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing the Factual Correctness of Abstractive Summarization of Radiology Reports using simple BART Finetuning" by Ravi Kondadadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the MEDIQA 2021 challenge, which suggests that datasets related to this challenge may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods** sections, particularly looking for any explicit mentions of datasets. In the introduction, the authors refer to the MEDIQA challenge and mention the use of a subset of the **MIMIC-CXR Dataset** for their experiments. This is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their work.In the **methods section**, the authors detail their experiments and mention that they fine-tuned their models on a subset of the **MIMIC-CXR Dataset**. This confirms that this dataset is central to their research.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **MIMIC-CXR Dataset**. The relevant citation is:- For **MIMIC-CXR Dataset**, the citation is: > Alistair E. W. Johnson, Tom Pollard, Roger Mark, Seth Berkowitz, and Steven Horng. *The MIMIC-CXR Database*. 2019.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **MIMIC-CXR Dataset**. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
