To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Replicating and Extending a Because Their Treebanks Leak: Graph Isomorphism, Covariants, and Parser Performance" by Mark Anderson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the replication of a previous study and hints at the use of treebanks, which suggests that datasets related to parsing performance might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the original study by SA gaard (2020) and the datasets used in that study. They reference the **CoNLL18** dataset, which is a well-known benchmark for parsing tasks in natural language processing.In the **methods section**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **CoNLL18** dataset for their analysis, which includes 33 UD treebanks. They also mention using **UDPipe 1.2** and **UDPipe 2.0** systems, but these are not datasets in the traditional sense; they are tools or models used for parsing tasks. However, they do reference the **CoNLL18** dataset again, confirming its significance.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **CoNLL18** dataset. The citation is:- For **CoNLL18**, the citation is: > Daniel Zeman, Jan Hajic, Martin Popel, Martin Potthast, Milan Straka, Filip Ginter, Joakim Nivre, and Slav Petrov. *CoNLL 2018 shared task: Multilingual parsing from raw text to Universal Dependencies*. In Proceedings of the CoNLL 2018 Shared Task: Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies, pages 1a21, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for **CoNLL18** and note that while **UDPipe 1.2** and **UDPipe 2.0** are not datasets but rather tools, they are crucial for the analysis conducted in the paper.Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **CoNLL18** dataset, as it is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper.
