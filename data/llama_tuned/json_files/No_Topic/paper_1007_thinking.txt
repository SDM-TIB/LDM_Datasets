To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discriminative Shape from Shading in Uncalibrated Illumination" by Stephan R. Richter and Stefan Roth, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for a large-scale dataset for training and analysis, which suggests that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **data for analysis and training sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the lack of suitable training data for shape-from-shading methods, indicating that datasets are crucial for their experiments. In the **data for analysis and training section**, they describe their own dataset, which is generated from 3D models created by artists. This section provides specific details about the dataset, including its size and the types of objects included.In the **experiments section**, the authors mention evaluating their method on several datasets, including synthetic data, real-world data from the MIT intrinsic image dataset, and their own dataset. This confirms that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to gather their names and descriptions.Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors refer to synthetic data generated for their training, but they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset. However, they mention that it is created by rendering synthetic shapes under known lighting conditions.2. **MIT Intrinsic Image Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is: > R. Grosse, M. K. Johnson, E. H. Adelson, and W. T. Freeman. *Ground truth dataset and baseline evaluations for intrinsic image algorithms*. In ICCV, 2009.3. **3D Models Dataset**: The authors describe their own dataset, which consists of 100 objects created by artists. Since this is a custom dataset, I will note that it does not have a formal citation, but I will include a description of it as it is unique to their research.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their descriptions and citations.
