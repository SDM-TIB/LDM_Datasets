To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Based on BERT-DAOA" by Chen-Yu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of BERT-DAOA for aspect-based sentiment analysis, which suggests that datasets related to sentiment analysis may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention a dataset specifically for their experiments, which is crucial for understanding the context of their work.I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often contain detailed information about the dataset size, class distribution, and other relevant metrics. In this case, the authors provide a table that lists the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and class distributions.In the table, I find the following datasets:1. **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,238 sentences, with 705 sentences classified as positive, 30 as negative, 17 as neutral, 426 as positive, 313 as negative, 782 as neutral, 375 as positive, 247 as negative, and 189 as neutral. The authors also provide the kappa statistic for evaluating the performance of their model.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference a paper that describes the dataset, which is essential for proper attribution.The citation for the dataset is:- For the **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Dataset**, the citation is: > Chen-Yu Chen, Chia-Hui Chang, and Huan Cao. *Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Based on BERT-DAOA*. In Proceedings of the 32nd Conference on Computational Linguistics and Speech Processing (ROCLING 2020), The Association for Computational Linguistics and Chinese Language Processing, 2020.Since the paper does not provide a specific URL or DOI for the dataset, I will note that it is referenced in the paper but does not have a publicly available link.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research, along with its citation for future reference or analysis.
