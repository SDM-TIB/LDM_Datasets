To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Syntax and Pragmatics of Conversation: A Case of Bangla" by D S Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the exploration of the semantics and pragmatics of the Bangla particle "to," which suggests that there may be datasets related to Bangla language or conversational data.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The authors mention the use of Bengali particle "to" in the context of conversation, but I need to look for specific datasets or sources of data that support their analysis.In the **main body of the paper**, particularly in sections discussing the syntax and pragmatics of the Bangla particle "to," I will look for any references to datasets that provide linguistic data or examples of conversational interactions. The paper may include examples or references to datasets that contain conversational data in Bangla or other relevant languages.After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.If the paper includes any datasets or examples that are based on existing linguistic resources or corpora, I will ensure to note the specific datasets mentioned, such as the Bangla language corpus or any other relevant linguistic resources that the authors rely on.Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and complete for future reference or analysis. This will involve verifying the accuracy of the dataset names and their citations to provide a reliable source of information for anyone interested in the datasets used in the research.
