To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Masked Latent Semantic Modeling: an Efficient Pre-training Alternative to Masked Language Modeling" by GAbor Berend, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed method and its evaluation, which suggests that datasets are likely used for experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention several datasets, including:1. **CoLA**: A dataset used for evaluating the performance of language models on acceptability judgments.2. **CoNLL 2003**: A dataset for named entity recognition tasks.3. **MNLI**: A dataset for natural language inference tasks.4. **MRPC**: A dataset for paraphrase evaluation.5. **QNLI**: A dataset for question-answering tasks.6. **QQP**: A dataset for question pairs.7. **RTE**: A dataset for recognizing textual entailment.8. **SST2**: A dataset for sentiment analysis.9. **STSB**: A dataset for semantic textual similarity.10. **WiC**: A dataset for evaluating context-sensitive meaning representations.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:- For **CoLA**, the citation is: > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1112a1122, 2018.- For **CoNLL 2003**, the citation is: > Erik F.

Dolan and Chris Brockett. *Automatically constructing a corpus of sentential paraphrases*.

Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631a1642, 2013.- For **STSB**, the citation is: > Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Eneko Agirre, Ido Dagan, and Bill Dolan. *SemEval-2017 task 1: Semantic textual similarity multilingual and crosslingual focused evaluation*.

In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 1267a1273, 2019.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
