To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Harnessing Privileged Information for Hyperbole Detection" by Rhys Biddle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on an existing hyperbole detection dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is referenced.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the **HYPO dataset**, which is described as an annotated collection of hyperbole. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.In the **methods section**, the authors provide more details about the **HYPO dataset**, stating that it consists of manually composed hyperbole and hyperbole sourced from various online sources, including click-bait headlines, love letters, advertisements, and animated cartoons. They also mention that the dataset includes three sub-corpora: **Hyperbole Corpus**, **Paraphrase Corpus**, and **Minimal Units Corpus**. This detailed description confirms the dataset's structure and purpose.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **HYPO dataset**. The citation is as follows:> Enrica Troiano, Carlo Strapparava, G. A. Ozbal, and Serra Sinem Tekiroglu. *A computational exploration of exaggeration*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 3296a3304, 2018.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **HYPO dataset**. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
