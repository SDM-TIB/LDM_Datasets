To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reducing infrequent-token perplexity via variational corpora" by Yusheng Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of variational corpora for improving language model performance, which suggests that datasets related to language modeling might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for their experiments. The introduction references the Brown corpus, which is a well-known dataset in natural language processing. This indicates that the Brown corpus is likely a dataset used in their research.In the **methodology section**, I will look for any additional datasets that the authors may have utilized for their experiments. The authors mention training their model on two versions of Jane Austen's works, which suggests that these works are part of a dataset or corpus used for their experiments.I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used for validation and testing. The authors split Jane Austen's novels into a target corpus and a pre-training corpus, which further confirms the datasets involved.Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:1. **Brown Corpus**: The citation is: > Nelson Francis and Henry Kucera. *Brown corpus manual*. Technical report, Department of Linguistics, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, US, 1979.2. **Jane Austen's Works**: The citation is: > Jane Austen. *Jane Austen's novels*. Various editions, 1813-1826.3. **Pinterest Captions**: The citation is: > Rhema Linder, Clair Snodgrass, and Andruid Kerne. *Everyday ideation: all of my ideas are on Pinterest*. In CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, CHI '14, Toronto, ON, Canada, April 26 - May 01, 2014, pages 2411a2420.After compiling this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
