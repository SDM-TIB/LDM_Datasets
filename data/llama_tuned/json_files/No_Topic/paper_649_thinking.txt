To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Identification of Participant Slots in Contracts" by Dan Simonson, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the identification of participant slots in contracts, which suggests that datasets related to contracts may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methodology** sections, particularly the subsections that detail the annotation process. Here, the authors mention the creation of a dataset for their annotation efforts, specifically stating that they produced a system as training data. This indicates that a dataset is being utilized for their experiments.In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the annotation process, which includes the creation of a dataset for four slots in Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and seven slots in Services Agreements. They mention that they completed 712 NDAs and 214 Services agreements, which are the datasets used for their experiments.Now, I will look for the **results section** to confirm the datasets used for evaluation. The authors refer to the datasets in the context of their evaluation metrics, which reinforces their significance in the research.Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors do not provide specific dataset names in the references, but they do reference other works that may have created datasets relevant to their research. I will need to look for those citations as well.In the **references section**, I find the following relevant citations:1. For the dataset created by the authors, I will note that it is a custom dataset created for their specific annotation task. Since it is not publicly available, I will cite it as follows: > Dan Simonson, Daniel Broderick, and Jonathan Herr. *The Extent of Repetition in Contract Language*. In Proceedings of the Natural Legal Language Processing Workshop 2019, pages 21a30, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2019. Association for Computational Linguistics.2. For the FrameNet dataset, which is referenced in the context of frame-based supervised approaches, the citation is: > Dan Simonson, Anthony Davis. *Narrative Schema Stability in News Text*. In Proceedings of COLING 2018, Santa Fe, NM, 2018. Association for Computational Linguistics.3. For the FrameNet dataset, the citation is: > Dan Simonson, Anthony Davis. *Narrative Schema Stability in News Text*. In Proceedings of COLING 2018, Santa Fe, NM, 2018. Association for Computational Linguistics.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, including the custom dataset created by the authors and the referenced datasets, into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
