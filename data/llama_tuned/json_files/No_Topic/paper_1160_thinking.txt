To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control" by Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the MuJoCo physics engine, but it does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments or evaluations. The introduction discusses the need for simulation tools in robotics and mentions the use of MuJoCo for control applications, but it does not specify any datasets.In the **experiments section**, I will look for any tables or figures that might indicate the datasets used for testing or evaluation. The paper discusses performance comparisons with other physics engines like SD/FAST, but it does not provide specific dataset names or descriptions.After reviewing the **results and discussion sections**, I will check for any tables or figures that might list the datasets used for the experiments. The paper mentions performance metrics and comparisons but does not provide detailed descriptions of datasets.Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include various papers related to robotics and physics engines, but they do not provide specific dataset names either.Finally, I will summarize my findings:1. **MuJoCo Dataset**: The paper describes MuJoCo as a physics engine for model-based control, but it does not provide a specific dataset name or citation.2. **SD/FAST Dataset**: The paper compares MuJoCo with SD/FAST, but again, no specific dataset name or citation is provided.In conclusion, it appears that the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide their citations. Therefore, I will note that the paper does not provide datasets for extraction.
