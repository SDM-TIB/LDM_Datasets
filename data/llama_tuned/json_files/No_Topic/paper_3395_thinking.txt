To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Best Student Forcing: A Simple Training Mechanism in Adversarial Language Generation" by Jonathan Sauder et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a novel training mechanism for GANs in NLG, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**, particularly the subsection titled **5.1 Dataset**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments: **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset**. This dataset is described as consisting of pairs of sequences with a label representing certain semantic attributes, resulting in 500k sequences after filtering the 5000 most common words.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SNLI dataset. The citation is as follows:> Bowman, S. R., Angeli, G., Potts, C., & Manning, C. D. (2015). A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference. arXiv preprint arXiv:1508.05326.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the SNLI dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the SNLI dataset, ensuring that it is ready for further processing or review.
