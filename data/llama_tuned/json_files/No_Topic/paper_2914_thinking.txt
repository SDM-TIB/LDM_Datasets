To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anlirikaas LSTMaCNN Flow Twister for Spoken Language Identification" by Andrei Shcherbakov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the task and the data used, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **dataset section**. In this paper, the authors describe the dataset used for training, validation, and testing. They mention that the training data is derived from the **CMU Wilderness dataset**, which represents a single domain (speech utterances from the Bible) and has predominantly a single speaker per language. This is a crucial piece of information as it indicates the primary dataset used for training.I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **validation and test sets**. The authors state that the validation and test sets were collected from multiple corpora, specifically mentioning **CommonVoice** as one of the sources. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved:1. **CMU Wilderness Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing speech utterances from the Bible in 700 languages, with a focus on single speakers per language. The citation for this dataset is: > Alan W. Black. *CMU Wilderness Multilingual Speech Dataset*. In ICASSP 2019-2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5971a5975, 2019.2. **CommonVoice Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a source for the validation and test sets, providing a variety of recording conditions with multiple speakers per language. The citation for this dataset is: > Rosana Ardila, Megan Branson, Kelly Davis, Michael Henretty, Michael Kohler, Josh Meyer, Reuben Morais, Lindsay Saunders, Francis M. Tyers, and Gregor Weber. *Common Voice: A massively-arXiv preprint multilingual speech corpus*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.06670, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
