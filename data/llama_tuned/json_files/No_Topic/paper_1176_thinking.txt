To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distribution-Calibrated Hierarchical Classification" by Ofer Dekel, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the calibration of hierarchical classification loss functions, which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to look for specific names.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The authors mention various taxonomies and classification systems, but I need to find specific datasets used for evaluation or training.In the **methodology section**, I will look for any subsections that detail the datasets used in experiments or evaluations. This is where the authors typically provide concrete dataset names and descriptions.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily.For this paper, I will focus on any datasets that are explicitly mentioned in the context of hierarchical classification or calibration. If the authors refer to specific datasets used for training or evaluation, I will note those down.Once I have gathered all the necessary information, including the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
