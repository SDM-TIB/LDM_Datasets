To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single Image Camera Calibration with Lenticular Arrays for Augmented Reality" by Ian Schillebeeckx and Robert Pless, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a calibration object based on lenticular arrays, which suggests that there may be datasets related to camera calibration or augmented reality applications.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for their experiments. The introduction discusses the challenges of camera calibration and the need for a calibration object, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.In the **experiments section**, I will look for any datasets that are used for testing or evaluation. The authors describe their calibration object and the methods used for calibration, but they do not specify any external datasets. Instead, they refer to their own calibration object, which is a lenticular array, as the primary dataset for their experiments.Since the paper does not mention any external datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. The focus is entirely on the calibration object and the methods developed by the authors, rather than on publicly available datasets.Finally, I will check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to the calibration object or any relevant datasets. However, the references primarily consist of other works related to camera calibration and augmented reality, without any specific datasets being cited.After gathering this information, I will compile my findings, noting that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.
