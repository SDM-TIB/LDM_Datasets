To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dependent Dirichlet Process Spike Sorting" by Jan Gasthaus et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their model on "two publicly available neural data recordings," which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention using a subset of the publicly available data set described in references [12] and [13]. This is a strong indication that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used:1. **Dataset 1**: This dataset consists of simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings of cells in the hippocampus of anesthetized rats. It includes 3187 spikes, with 831 spikes originating from the identified neuron.2. **Dataset 2**: This dataset contains 3502 spikes, with 553 spikes detected on the intracellular channel, indicating that it includes spikes from the same neuron as in Dataset 1.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **Dataset 1**, the citation is: > D. A. Henze, Z. Borhegyi, J. Csicsvari, A. Mamiya, K. D. Harris, and G. Buzsáki. *Intracellular features predicted by extracellular recordings in the hippocampus in vivo*. Journal of Neurophysiology, 84(1):390a400, 2000.- For **Dataset 2**, the citation is: > K. D. Harris, D. A. Henze, J. Csicsvari, H. Hirase, and G. Buzsáki. *Accuracy of tetrode spike separation as determined by simultaneous intracellular and extracellular measurements*. Journal of Neurophysiology, 81(1):401a414, 2000.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
