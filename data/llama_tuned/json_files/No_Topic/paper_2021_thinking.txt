To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Flexible, Multi-Modal Language Model Training using Phonetic Representations of Data" by Shivachi Casper Shikali and Mokhosi Refuoe, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of phonetic representations for language model training, which suggests that datasets related to language models and phonetics may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets used for their experiments. The introduction highlights the challenges of language model training and mentions the use of "text and/or audio data" but does not specify datasets yet.In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used for pre-training and fine-tuning the models. The authors mention using various combinations of Swahili and Kinyarwanda datasets, which indicates that specific datasets are being utilized for their experiments.I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used for evaluation. The authors refer to datasets like "Language Modeling Data for Swahili," "ALFFA speech dataset," and "MasakhaNER dataset." This confirms that these datasets are integral to their research.Now, I will consult the **references section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:1. **Language Modeling Data for Swahili**: The citation is: > Shivachi Casper Shikali and Mokhosi Refuoe. *Language modeling data for Swahili*. Hugging Face, 2019.2. **ALFFA speech dataset**: The citation is: > Hadrien Gelas, Laurent Besacier, and FranÃ§ois Pellegrino. *Developments of Swahili resources for an automatic speech recognition system*. In SLTU- Workshop on Spoken Language Technologies for Under-Resourced Languages, Cape-Town, Afrique Du Sud, 2012.3. **MasakhaNER dataset**: The citation is: > D. Adelani, Jade Z. Abbott, Graham Neubig, Daniel Dasouza, Julia Kreutzer, Constantine Lignos, Chester Palen-Michel, Happy Buzaaba, Shruti Rijhwani, Sebastian Ruder, Stephen Mayhew, Israel Abebe Azime, Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhammad, Chris C. Emezue, Joyce Nakatumba-Nabende, Perez Ogayo, Anuoluwapo Aremu, Catherine Gitau, Derguene Mbaye, J. Alabi, Seid Muhie Yimam, Tajuddeen R. Gwadabe, Ignatius Ezeani, Rubungo Andre Niyongabo, Jonathan Mukiibi, Verrah A Otiende, Iroro Orife, Davis David, Samba Ngom, Tosin P. Adewumi, Paul Rayson, Mofetoluwa Adeyemi, Gerald Muriuki, Emmanuel Anebi, Chiamaka Ijeoma Chukwuneke, Nkiruka Bridget Odu, Eric Peter Wairagala, S. Aji-boye Oyerinde, Clemencia Siro, Tobius Saul Bateesa, 2021. *MasakhaNER: Named Entity Recognition for African Languages*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 9:1116a1131.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
