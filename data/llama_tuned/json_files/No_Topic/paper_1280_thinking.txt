To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Early Rumour Detection" by Kaimin Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on Twitter and Weibo, which suggests that these platforms are likely to be the datasets used.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention two datasets:1. **WEIBO Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method for early rumour detection. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of posts, events, and rumours, which is crucial for understanding its scope.2. **TWITTER Dataset**: Similar to the WEIBO dataset, this dataset is also used for evaluating the proposed method. The authors provide similar statistics, including the number of posts, events, and rumours.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **WEIBO Dataset**, the citation is: > Jing Ma, Wei Gao, and Kam-Fai Wong. *Detecting rumors from microblogs with recurrent neural networks*. In Proceedings of the 24th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, pages 3818a3824, 2016.- For the **TWITTER Dataset**, the citation is: > Arkaitz Zubiaga, Maria Liakata, and Rob Procter. *Learning reporting dynamics during breaking news for rumor detection in social media*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.07363, 2016.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
