To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can the Transformer Learn Nested Recursion with Symbol Masking?" by Jean-Philippe Bernardy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a specific language model for nested recursion, which suggests that datasets related to this language model may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **data sets section**. Here, the authors describe the language Dn, which is generated by context-free rules. They provide details about how the strings are constructed, including the number of matching pairs and the maximum distance between opening and closing parentheses. This indicates that Dn is a dataset used in their experiments.In the **data sets section**, the authors specify that they use the language Dn for their experiments, but they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset. However, I will note that the language Dn is a custom dataset created for the purpose of this research.Since the paper does not reference any external datasets but rather describes a constructed language, I will summarize the dataset as follows:1. **Language Dn**: A dataset generated by context-free rules, consisting of strings with matching pairs of parentheses. The dataset is used to test the model's ability to generalize to longer distances and deeper nesting.Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the language Dn or any other datasets mentioned in the paper. However, since Dn is a custom dataset created for this study, it does not have a formal citation like traditional datasets. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is original and does not have a specific citation.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format, ensuring that I include the description and the note about it being a custom dataset without a formal citation.
