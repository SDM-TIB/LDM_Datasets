To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mind marginal non-crack regions: Clustering-inspired representation learning for crack segmentation" by Zhuangzhuang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a novel method for crack segmentation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for evaluation or benchmarking. The introduction discusses the challenges in crack segmentation and mentions the need for high-quality datasets, but it does not specify any datasets yet.In the **method section**, the authors describe their proposed framework and mention the **CrackSeg5k dataset** as a dataset they constructed. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their experiments.I will then look for the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used for evaluation. The authors state that they conducted experiments on the **CrackSeg5k dataset**, which they collected from nuclear power plants, and also mention two other datasets: **Crack500** and **CrackTree200**. These datasets are used for comparison with their proposed method.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For **CrackSeg5k**, the citation is: > Shreyas Kulkarni, Shreyas Singh, Dhananjay Balakrishnan, Siddharth Sharma, Saipraneeth Devunuri, and Sai Chowdeswara Rao Korlapati. *CrackSeg9k: A collection and benchmark for crack segmentation datasets and frameworks*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 179a195, 2022.2. For **Crack500**, the citation is: > Lei Zhang, Fan Yang, Yimin Daniel Zhang, and Ying Julie Zhu. *Road crack detection using deep convolutional neural network*. In ICIP, pages 3708a3712, 2016.3. For **CrackTree200**, the citation is: > Qin Zou, Yu Cao, Qingquan Li, Qingzhou Mao, and Song Wang. *CrackTree: Automatic crack detection from pavement images*. Pattern Recognition Letters, 33(3):227a238, 2012.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
