To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DUAL ADVERSARIAL MODEL FOR GENERATING 3DPOINT CLOUD" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the synthesis of 3D point clouds, which suggests that datasets related to 3D data may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets used for their experiments. The introduction discusses the challenges of point cloud data and mentions the use of the **ShapeNet dataset** for evaluating their model, indicating that this is a key dataset for their research.In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide a table comparing their model's performance on various datasets, specifically mentioning **ModelNet40** and **ModelNet10**. This confirms that these datasets are used for evaluation purposes.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:1. For **ShapeNet**, the citation is: > Angel X. Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, and Su Hao. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. In Computer Science, 2015.2. For **ModelNet40**, the citation is: > Zhirong Wu, Shuran Song, Aditya Khosla, Fisher Yu, Linguang Zhang, Xiaoou Tang, and Jianxiong Xiao. *3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1912a1920, 2015.3. For **ModelNet10**, the citation is the same as ModelNet40 since it is a subset of the same dataset.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
