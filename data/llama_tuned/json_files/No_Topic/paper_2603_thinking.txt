To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Native Language Identification using Phonetic Algorithms" by Charese Smiley and Sandra K A ubler, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of phonetic algorithms for Native Language Identification (NLI), which suggests that datasets related to NLI may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **data section**. Here, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention that the data consists of essays from 11 languages, which is a clear indication of a dataset. The specific datasets they refer to include:1. **TOEFL11 Corpus**: This dataset is used for training and testing the NLI system. It contains essays from 11 languages, with a total of 11,000 training essays and 1,100 development essays for each language. The authors also mention that the test data is drawn from a similar distribution as the original TOEFL11 corpus.2. **Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary (CMU)**: This dictionary provides a lookup for the pronunciation of known words, which is utilized in the experiments.3. **Speech Transcripts**: The authors also mention that transcripts of speech are included in the data release, which adds another dataset component.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **TOEFL11 Corpus**, the citation is: > Joel Tetreault, Daniel Blanchard, and Aoife Cahill. *A Report on the First Native Language Identification Shared Task*. In Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop on Building Educational Applications Using NLP, pages 1-8, 2013.- For the **Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary (CMU)**, the citation is: > Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary. Available at: http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/2- For the **Speech Transcripts**, the citation is: > Shervin Malmasi, Keelan Evanini, Aoife Cahill, Joel Tetreault, Robert Pugh, Christopher Hamill, Diane Napolitano, and Yao Qian. *A Report on the 2017 Native Language Identification Shared Task*. In Proceedings of the 12th Workshop on Building Educational Applications Using NLP, pages 1-8, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
