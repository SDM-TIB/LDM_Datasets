To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finite State Intensional Semantics" by Mats Rooth, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced or described. The abstract discusses the use of finite state acceptors and transducers, which suggests that there may be datasets related to linguistic semantics or computational models.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the framework of the paper and the use of finite state calculus, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look further into the **methodology and implementation sections** for more detailed information.In the **implementation section**, the author describes the use of a parser for categorial grammar and a toolkit for the finite state calculus. However, it does not specify any datasets used for training or evaluation. I will also check the **experiments and results sections** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the proposed methods or evaluations.Since the paper does not provide specific datasets or their citations, I will look for any references to datasets in the **references section**. However, the references primarily consist of foundational works in the field of linguistics and computational semantics, rather than datasets.After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the author does not explicitly mention any datasets used in their research. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper, as they do not provide specific references to datasets or their citations.Finally, I will compile my findings, noting that no datasets were identified in the paper, and prepare to provide a structured response with the conclusion that no datasets were extracted.
