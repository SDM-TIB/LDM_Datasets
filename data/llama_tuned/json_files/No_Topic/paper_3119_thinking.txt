To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bilingual Data Cleaning for SMT using Graph-based Random Walk" by Lei Cuia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of bilingual data quality in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they evaluated their bilingual data cleaning approach on several datasets, including:1. **NIST 2003 (dev)**: This dataset is used for development tasks in machine translation.2. **NIST 2005 (test)**: This dataset is used for testing in machine translation.3. **NIST 2006 (test)**: Another testing dataset for evaluating the proposed method.4. **NIST 2008 (test)**: A testing dataset for the bilingual data cleaning approach.5. **CWMT 2008 (test)**: A testing dataset for the proposed method.6. **In-house dataset 1 (test)**: An in-house dataset created for testing the bilingual data cleaning method.7. **In-house dataset 2 (test)**: Another in-house dataset used for testing the proposed approach.In the **setup section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets, confirming their use in the experiments. They mention that the datasets contain around 30 million sentence pairs in total, which is crucial for understanding the scale of the datasets.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **NIST 2003**, the citation is: > NIST. *NIST 2003 Statistical Machine Translation Evaluation System*. 2003.- For **NIST 2005**, the citation is: > NIST. *NIST 2005 Statistical Machine Translation Evaluation System*. 2005.- For **NIST 2006**, the citation is: > NIST. *NIST 2006 Statistical Machine Translation Evaluation System*. 2006.- For **NIST 2008**, the citation is: > NIST. *NIST 2008 Statistical Machine Translation Evaluation System*. 2008.- For **CWMT 2008**, the citation is: > CWMT. *CWMT 2008 Statistical Machine Translation Evaluation System*. 2008.- For the **In-house datasets**, since they are not publicly available, I will note that they are proprietary datasets created by the authors of this paper.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the publicly available datasets. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
