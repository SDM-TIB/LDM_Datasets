To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Framework of Semantic Role Assignment based on Extended Lexical Conceptual Structure: Comparison with VerbNet and FrameNet" by Yuichiro Matsubayashi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for semantic role labeling frameworks and mentions the use of existing resources like PropBank and FrameNet, indicating that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the limitations of existing resources like PropBank and FrameNet. They mention that they developed a new framework for semantic role annotation, which suggests that they may have created or utilized specific datasets for their experiments.In the **methodology section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for their empirical analysis. The authors refer to the **Kyoto University Text Corpus (KTC)**, which is a significant dataset for their experiments. They mention that they analyzed 60 Japanese verbs and constructed a dictionary of LCS structures based on this corpus.I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to confirm the datasets used and their significance in the context of their findings. The authors reference the **Kyoto University Text Corpus (KTC)** again, reinforcing its importance in their work.Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Kyoto University Text Corpus (KTC)**. The citation is as follows:> Sadao Kurohashi and Makoto Nagao. *Kyoto University Text Corpus Project*. Proceedings of the Annual Conference of JSAI, 11:58a61, 1997.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **Kyoto University Text Corpus (KTC)**. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
