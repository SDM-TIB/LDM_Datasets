To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Domain adaptation model for retinopathy detection from cross-domain OCT images" by Jing Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **dataset section** (section 4) where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:1. **MNIST-USPS Dataset**: This dataset is used for digits recognition tasks. The authors describe it as containing digit images ranging from 1 to 10 with different styles, and they specify the training and validation sets.2. **Custom Retinal OCT Images Dataset**: This dataset consists of retinal images captured from two different OCT devices, Cirrus and Spectralis. The authors provide details about the number of images, subjects, and the labeling process.In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used these two datasets for their evaluations, which reinforces their relevance.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/- For the **MNIST-USPS Dataset**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/- For the **Custom Retinal OCT Images Dataset**, the authors do not provide a formal citation, as it is a custom dataset created for their research. However, I will note that the dataset is referenced in the paper itself, and the authors describe it in detail.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the publicly available datasets and a description of the custom dataset used in the research. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the study.
