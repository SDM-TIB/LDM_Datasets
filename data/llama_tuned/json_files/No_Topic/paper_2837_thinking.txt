To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dense Monocular Depth Estimation in Complex Dynamic Scenes" by RenÃ© Ranftl et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach on two datasets, which suggests that specific names will be provided later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they state that they evaluate their approach on the **MPI Sintel dataset** and the **KITTI dataset**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for the research.I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For the **MPI Sintel dataset**, the citation is: > D. J. Butler, J. Wulff, G. B. Stanley, and M. J. Black. *An naturalistic open source movie for optical flow evaluation*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2012.- For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is: > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, C. Stiller, and R. Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. International Journal of Robotics Research, 32(11), 2013.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
