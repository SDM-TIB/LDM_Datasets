To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoRuSS: A New Prosodically Annotated Corpus of Russian Spontaneous Speech" by Tatiana Kachkovskaia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, corpus design and creation, and statistics sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the corpus, and the introduction discusses the need for a prosodically annotated corpus of spontaneous speech, which suggests that a dataset is being introduced.Next, I will focus on the **corpus design and creation section**. Here, the authors describe the corpus in detail, mentioning that it contains 30 hours of high-quality recorded spontaneous Russian speech, with half of it transcribed and annotated. This indicates that the dataset is comprehensive and includes various types of recordings, such as dialogues, monologues, and reading of a phonetically balanced text.In the **statistics section**, the authors provide insights into the corpus's content, including the number of running words, accentual phrases, and the total number of intonational phrases. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.In the **acknowledgments section**, I will look for any references to datasets or sources that may have contributed to the corpus. However, the focus here is on the authors' work and the corpus they created, rather than external datasets.Since the paper primarily discusses the CoRuSS corpus itself, I will compile the information about this dataset, including its characteristics and the context in which it was created. The key points I will extract include:1. **CoRuSS Corpus**: This dataset consists of 30 hours of high-quality recorded spontaneous Russian speech, with half of it transcribed and annotated. It includes dialogues, monologues, and reading of a phonetically balanced text.2. **Speaker Information**: The corpus was recorded from 60 native Russian speakers, with specific details about their age, gender, education, and other relevant characteristics.3. **Annotation Process**: The dataset includes detailed annotations for prosodic and phonetic aspects of the speech, which is a significant aspect of the corpus.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CoRuSS corpus. The authors reference their own work, but I need to ensure I have the correct citation format. The citation for the CoRuSS corpus is:> Tatiana Kachkovskaia, Daniil Kocharov, Pavel Skrelin, Nina Volskaya. *CoRuSS: A New Prosodically Annotated Corpus of Russian Spontaneous Speech*. In Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Speech and Prosody of Speech, 2023.After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the CoRuSS corpus, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset and its significance in the field of speech processing.
