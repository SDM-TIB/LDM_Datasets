To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VolTAGE: Volatility Forecasting via Text Audio Fusion with Graph Convolution Networks for Earnings Calls" by Ramit Sawhney et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of earnings calls for volatility forecasting, which suggests that datasets related to these calls may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 5.1) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using the **S&P 500 2017 Earnings Conference Calls dataset**. This dataset consists of 559 earnings call audio recordings and their transcripts for 277 public companies in the S&P 500 index. The authors provide details about how the data is structured and the preprocessing steps taken.In the **references section**, I will look for the full citation of the dataset. The relevant citation for the S&P 500 2017 Earnings Conference Calls dataset is:- For this dataset, the citation is: > Yu Qin and Yi Yang. *What you say and how you say it matters: Predicting stock volatility using verbal and vocal cues*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 390a401, Florence, Italy, 2019.Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset.After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the S&P 500 2017 Earnings Conference Calls dataset, ensuring that the citation is accurate and complete for future reference.
