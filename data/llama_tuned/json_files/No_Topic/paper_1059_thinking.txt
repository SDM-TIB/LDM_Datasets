To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Clause Attention for Long Sentence Processing" by Niu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of signal words for long sentence processing, which suggests that datasets related to natural language processing (NLP) might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the need for efficient long sentence processing and hint at the use of datasets for training their models. I will look for specific dataset names or descriptions.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. They state that they evaluate their method on the **CoNLL-2003 dataset** for the NER task and the **NiuTrans dataset** for the NMT task. This is a clear indication of the datasets used.I will also check the **results section** to confirm the datasets' roles in the experiments and to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned. The authors provide a table showing the performance metrics for their method, which may include details about the datasets used for evaluation.Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:1. For the **CoNLL-2003 dataset**, the citation is: > Christopher D. Manning and Sanjeev Kumar. *CoNLL-2003: A Comparison of Phrase Structure Tagging Systems*. In Proceedings of the 41st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 1-10, 2003.2. For the **NiuTrans dataset**, the citation is: > Qiang Wang, Bei Li, Jiqiang Liu, Bojian Jiang, Zheyang Zhang, Yinqiao Li, Ye Lin, Tong Xiao, and Jingbo Zhu. *The NiuTrans machine translation system for WMT18*. In Proceedings of the Third Conference on Machine Translation: Shared Task Papers, pages 7528a534, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
