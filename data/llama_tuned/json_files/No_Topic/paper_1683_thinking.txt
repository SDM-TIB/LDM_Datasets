To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning brain regions via large-scale online structured sparse dictionary-learning" by Elvis Dohmatob et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a large public dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the use of a large public dataset for their experiments, but they do not specify the dataset name. I will need to look for more details in the methods or results sections.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they conducted their experiments on **task fMRI data from 500 subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset**. This is a significant dataset for neuroimaging studies, and I will need to gather more details about it.In the **results section**, the authors describe the experiments conducted on the HCP dataset, confirming its use for their analysis. They also mention that the dataset includes task fMRI data related to language and mathematics tasks, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's application.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Human Connectome Project dataset. The citation is as follows:> D. van Essen et al. "The Human Connectome Project: A data acquisition perspective." *NeuroImage*, 62: 1-13, 2012. https://www.humanconnectome.org/With this information, I can now summarize the dataset details and prepare to create the JSON output.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation, ensuring that it is complete and ready for any further processing or review.
