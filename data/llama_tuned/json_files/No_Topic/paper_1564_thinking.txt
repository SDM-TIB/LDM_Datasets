To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Negotiable Reinforcement Learning for ParetoOptimal Sequential Decision-Making" by Nishant Desai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the implementation of a simple NRL agent and empirical observations, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors describe their experiments. They mention using a modified version of the **FrozenLake environment** from OpenAI Gym. This indicates that the FrozenLake environment is a dataset or a simulation environment used for their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about how they modified the FrozenLake environment to support multiple goal states, which further confirms that this is a dataset or environment used for their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FrozenLake environment. The citation is:- For **FrozenLake**, the citation is: > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. 2016. Available at: https://gym.openai.com/gym/After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for FrozenLake, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research paper.
