To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Unsupervised Learning of the 3D Kinematic Structure of Arbitrary Rigid Bodies" by Urbano Miguel Nunes and Yiannis Demiris, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the problem of 3D kinematic structure learning and mentions the use of RGB-D data sequences, which suggests that datasets related to RGB-D data may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention that their method was evaluated on the dataset provided by Dimitrios Tzionas and Juergen Gall, as well as two newly recorded sequences. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to extract:1. **RGB-D Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of RGB-D data sequences, which is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.2. **Newly Recorded Sequences**: The authors mention that they recorded two new sequences, but they do not provide specific names or details about these sequences in the text. However, I will note that they are part of the experimental setup and will look for their citations later in the references.In the **references section**, I will find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:1. For the **RGB-D Dataset**, the citation is: > Dimitrios Tzionas and Juergen Gall. *Reconstructing articulated rigged models from RGB-D videos*. In European Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, pages 620a633, 2016.2. For the **Newly Recorded Sequences**, since they are not explicitly named in the paper, I will note that they are part of the authors' own experiments and do not have a formal citation. However, I will document them as "Newly Recorded Sequences" without a specific citation.Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the RGB-D dataset and noting the lack of formal citations for the newly recorded sequences. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their respective citations.
