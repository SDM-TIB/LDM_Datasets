To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Preliminary Experiments on Crowdsourced Evaluation of Feedback Granularity" by Nitin Madnani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a crowdsourced experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to this platform.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**. Here, the authors describe the tasks and the types of feedback provided to the Turkers. They mention using the **CLC-FCE corpus**, which is manually annotated for preposition errors by professional English language instructors. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in their experiments.In the **experimental setup**, the authors specify that they randomly selected 90 sentences with preposition errors and 45 sentences without errors from the CLC-FCE corpus. This confirms that the CLC-FCE corpus is the primary dataset used in their study.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CLC-FCE corpus. The citation is as follows:> Helen Yannakoudakis, Ted Briscoe, and Ben Medlock. *A New Dataset and Method for Automatically Grading ESOL Texts*. In Proceedings of the ACL: HLT, pages 180a189, Portland, OR, USA, 2011.Since the CLC-FCE corpus is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is the **CLC-FCE corpus**, and I will ensure to include its full citation in the output.
