To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online List Labeling with Predictions" by Samuel McCauley et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on "numerous real datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention using datasets from the **SNAP Large Network Dataset Collection**. They state that they tested their method on several real datasets, but they do not provide specific names in the abstract or introduction. I will need to look for a list of datasets in the experiments section.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a table summarizing the performance of their method on various datasets. They list the following datasets:1. **Gowalla**: This dataset is used for location-based social networking, where users share their locations by checking in. The authors mention that they used the latitudes of each user as elements in the input sequence.2. **MOOC AskUbuntu**: This dataset is related to online learning and is used for evaluating the performance of their method.3. **Eu-core**: This dataset is also used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **Gowalla**, the citation is: > Eunjoon Cho, Seth A Myers, and Jure Leskovec. *Friendship and mobility: user movement in location-based social networks*. In Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, pages 1082a1090, 2011.- For **MOOC AskUbuntu**, the citation is: > Jure Leskovec and Andrej Krevl. *SNAP Datasets: Stanford large network dataset collection*. http://snap.stanford.edu/data, June 2014.- For **Eu-core**, the citation is: > Jure Leskovec and Andrej Krevl. *SNAP Datasets: Stanford large network dataset collection*. http://snap.stanford.edu/data, June 2014.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
