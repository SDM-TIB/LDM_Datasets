To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Painless Labeling with Application to Text Mining" by Sajib Dasgupta, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the creation of labeled resources for categorical data, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), where the author explicitly lists the datasets used for evaluation. Here, I find the following datasets:1. **Gender Dataset**: This dataset contains 19320 blog articles, with 5000 selected for the analysis. The author references the dataset introduced by Schler et al. (2006) for this task.2. **Spam Dataset**: The author uses the Enron spam dataset, which consists of 5000 emails selected from the BG section of Spam emails and the kaminski section of Ham emails.3. **Sentiment Dataset**: The dataset contains 2000 movie reviews annotated with positive and negative sentiment labels. The author cites Pang et al. (2002) as the source of this dataset.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Gender Dataset**, the citation is: > J. Schler, M. Koppel, S. Argamon, and J. Pennebaker. *Effects of age and gender in blogging*. AAAI Symposium on Computational Approaches for Analyzing Weblogs, 2006.- For the **Spam Dataset**, the citation is: > V. Metsis, I. Androutsopoulos, and G. Paliouras. *Spam filtering with naive bayes - which naive bayes?*. In 3rd Conference on Email and Anti-Spam (CEAS), 2006.- For the **Sentiment Dataset**, the citation is: > B. Pang, Lillian Lee, and Shivakumar Vaithyanathan. *Thumbs up? Sentiment classification using machine learning techniques*. In Proceedings of Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2002.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
