To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extracting Economic Signals from Central Bank Speeches" by Maximilian Ahrens and Michael McMahon, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of central bank speeches for monetary policy shock series, indicating that datasets related to these speeches are likely included.Next, I will focus on the **data section** where the authors describe their empirical dataset. They mention two distinct datasets:1. **FEDas Greenbook data**: This dataset consists of all numerical and text data captured in the 145 Greenbooks released from 1990 to 2013. It includes numerical estimates of economic indicators and forecasts for various time horizons, along with accompanying text passages that provide context for the forecasts.2. **Public speeches of central bankers**: This dataset comprises textual transcripts of over 3000 speeches given by central bankers over the time span from 1993 to 2013. The authors describe how they use this dataset to estimate monetary policy signals and dispersion indices.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **FEDas Greenbook data**, the citation is: > Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. *Greenbook*. Available at: https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/monetarypolicy/greenbook.html- For the **public speeches of central bankers**, the citation is: > Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. *Speeches of Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco*. Available at: https://www.federalreserve.gov/speeches/After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
