To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent Trees for Coreference Resolution" by Eraldo R. Fernandes et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their system on the **CoNLL-2012 Shared Task data sets**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their research.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections** to gather more details about the datasets used. The introduction mentions the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task, which is a well-known benchmark for coreference resolution. I will look for specific details about the datasets used in the experiments.In the **methods section**, the authors describe the datasets in detail, stating that they apply their system to the **CoNLL-2012 Shared Task data sets**, which comprise three languages: Arabic, Chinese, and English. They also mention that the datasets include various annotation layers such as part-of-speech tags, syntactic parses, and named entities.Now, I will check the **results section** to confirm the datasets used for evaluation. The authors report their performance on the **CoNLL-2012 Shared Task data sets**, which reinforces the importance of this dataset in their research.In the **references section**, I will look for the full citation of the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task. The citation is:> Pradhan, S., Moschitti, A., Xue, N., Uryupina, O., & Zhang, Y. (2012). CoNLL-2012 Shared Task: Modeling multilingual unrestricted coreference in OntoNotes. In Joint Conference on EMNLP and CoNLLa Shared Task, CoNLLa12, pages 1a40, Jeju Island.With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
