To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Co-reference Resolution of Elided Subjects and Possessive Pronouns in Spanish-English Statistical Machine Translation" by Annette Rios and Don Tuggener, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the integration of co-reference information into machine translation, which suggests that datasets related to co-reference resolution might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets used for their experiments. The introduction mentions the use of the **AnCora treebank** for training the co-reference system, which indicates that this is a dataset relevant to their work.In the **methods section**, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the use of the **Se-mEval 2010 shared task dataset** for evaluating their co-reference resolution method. This dataset is specifically mentioned as a benchmark for their experiments.I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors state that they extracted a subset of 90,000 sentences from the **NC11 corpus** for their experiments, which is another dataset relevant to their research.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **AnCora treebank**, the citation is: > Mariona TaulA e, Ant´onia Mart´A, and Marta Recasens. *AnCora: Multilevel Annotated Corpora for Catalan and Spanish*. In Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, pages 1-8, 2008.2. For the **Se-mEval 2010 shared task dataset**, the citation is: > SemEval 2010. *Se-mEval 2010 shared task data set*. Available at: http://stel.ub.edu/semeval2010-coref/3. For the **NC11 corpus**, the citation is: > OPUS. *Spanish-English part of the news commentary texts from 2011 (NC11)*. Available at: http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
