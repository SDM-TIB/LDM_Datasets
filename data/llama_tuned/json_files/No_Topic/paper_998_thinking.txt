To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Information-Theoretic Approach to Modeling Diachronic Change in Scientific English" by Stefania Degaetano-Ortlieb et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of diachronic word embeddings, which suggests that datasets related to language change might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets used for their analysis. The introduction references the **Royal Society Corpus (RSC)**, indicating that this is a key dataset for their study.In the **methods section**, the authors provide more details about the **Royal Society Corpus (RSC)**, describing it as a diachronic corpus containing publications from the Philosophical Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of London from 1665 to 1869. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides statistics about its size and content.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Royal Society Corpus (RSC)**. The citation is as follows:> Hannah Kermes, Stefania Degaetano-Ortlieb, Ashraf Khamis, Jörg Knappen, and Elke Teich. *The Royal Society Corpus: From Uncharted Data to Corpus*. In Proceedings of the 10th LREC, Portorož, Slovenia, 2016. ELRA.Since the **Royal Society Corpus (RSC)** is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **Royal Society Corpus (RSC)**, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
