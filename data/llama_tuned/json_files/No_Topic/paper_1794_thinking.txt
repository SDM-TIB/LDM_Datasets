To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Impact of French Inclusive Language on NLP Tools" by Cyril Grouin, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of NLP tools on French Inclusive Language (FIL) but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections**. In the introduction, the author mentions the use of a corpus for evaluating NLP tools, which suggests that a dataset is involved. I will look for specific names of datasets or references to them.In the **methods section**, the author describes the corpus used for the experiments. The paper states that the corpus consists of 21 files, which are derived from political speeches and government documents. This indicates that the dataset is a collection of text data related to French Inclusive Language.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the corpus. The paper references the corpus as follows:- For the corpus, the citation is: > Cyril Grouin. *Impact of French Inclusive Language on NLP Tools*. In Actes de la 29e Conf√©rence sur le Traitement Automatique des Langues Naturelles, pages 126a135, 2022. Available at: https://github.com/grouin/corpus-francais-inclusif.gitThis citation provides the necessary details about the dataset, including its name, description, and how to access it.Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation as required. The dataset is a corpus specifically designed for evaluating NLP tools on French Inclusive Language, and it is available for public access.
