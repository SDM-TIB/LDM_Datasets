To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discriminating between similar languages or language varieties aims to detect lexical and semantic variations in order to classify these varieties of languages" by Marc Franco-Salvador et al., I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their system on the **DSL Corpus Collection**, which suggests that this is a key dataset.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **evaluation sections** to gather more details about the datasets used. In the **evaluation section**, the authors explicitly mention the **DSL Corpus Collection** and provide details about its structure and content, including the languages it includes and the test sets used.In the **dataset section**, the authors describe the **DSL Corpus Collection** in detail, stating that it contains sentences in multiple languages, including Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Czech, Slovak, Argentinian Spanish, Peninsular Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, Malay, Indonesian, and a group containing texts written in other languages. This section confirms the dataset's relevance to their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **DSL Corpus Collection**. The citation is as follows:> Liling Tan, Marcos Zampieri, Nikola Ljubešić, and Jörg Tiedemann. *Merging comparable datasets for the discrimination of similar languages: The DSL corpus collection*. In Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Building and Using Comparable Corpora, pages 11a15, Reykjavik, Iceland, 2014.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **DSL Corpus Collection**. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
