To extract datasets from the research paper titled "T3-Vis: a visual analytic framework for Training and Fine-Tuning Transformers in NLP" by Raymond Lia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the framework's application in NLP tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **case studies section** (section 3.2) where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets used for their evaluations:1. **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of extractive summarization tasks. The authors describe its use in their experiments, indicating it is a dataset relevant to their research.2. **Yahoo Answers dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of error analysis for topic classification tasks. The authors explain how they utilized this dataset to identify misclassified examples, confirming its significance in their study.In the **references section**, I will look for the full citations of these datasets to ensure I have the complete information needed for each dataset:- For the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**, the citation is: > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend text*. In Advances in Neural Information and Cognitive Processing Systems, volume 28, pages 1693a1701, 2015.- For the **Yahoo Answers dataset**, the citation is: > Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 28:649a657, 2015.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
