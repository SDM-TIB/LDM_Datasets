To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Impact of Typicality for Informative Representative Selection" by Jawadul H. Bappy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a novel sample selection strategy and mentions "five datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments, which are crucial for understanding the context and application of their proposed method.In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they performed evaluations on the following datasets:1. **MSRC Dataset**: This dataset is used for joint scene-object classification tasks. The authors provide details about the number of classes and the ground truth for this dataset.2. **MIT-67 Indoor Dataset**: This dataset is also used for joint scene-object classification and is noted for its rich contextual information.3. **CAD-120 Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for joint activity-object classification tasks, providing a specific focus on human activities and object affordances.4. **Scene-15 Dataset**: This dataset is used for scene classification tasks, providing a benchmark for evaluating scene recognition models.5. **VOC2010 Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for object recognition tasks, particularly in the context of object detection.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:- For the **MSRC Dataset**, the citation is: > T. Malisiewicz and A. A. Efros. *Improving spatial support for objects via multiple segmentations*. In BMVC, 2007.- For the **MIT-67 Indoor Dataset**, the citation is: > A. Quattoni and A. Torralba. *Recognizing indoor scenes*. In CVPR, 2009.- For the **CAD-120 Dataset**, the citation is: > H. S. Koppula, R. Gupta, and A. Saxena. *Learning human activities and object affordances from RGB-D videos*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 2013.- For the **Scene-15 Dataset**, the citation is: > S. Lazebnik, C. Schmid, and J. Ponce. *Beyond bags of features: Spatial pyramid matching for recognizing natural scene categories*. In CVPR, 2006.- For the **VOC2010 Dataset**, the citation is: > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. IJCV, 2010.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
