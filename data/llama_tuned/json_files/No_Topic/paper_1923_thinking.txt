To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Auto-Encoding Dictionary Definitions into Consistent Word Embeddings" by Tom Bosc and Mila, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of dictionary definitions for word embeddings, which suggests that datasets related to dictionaries might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets or resources used for their experiments. The introduction discusses the importance of dictionary definitions but does not explicitly name any datasets.In the **methods section**, I will look for any datasets that are explicitly mentioned as being used for training or evaluation. The authors refer to the use of the **WordNet** dictionary, which is a well-known lexical database. However, I need to confirm if this is a dataset or a resource that is used for training or evaluation.I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for benchmarking their model. They refer to using the **SimVerb3500** and **MEN** datasets for evaluating their model's performance on similarity and relatedness tasks. This indicates that these datasets are indeed used in their experiments.Now, I will consult the **references section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:1. **WordNet**: The citation is: > Christian Fellbaum. *WordNet*. Wiley Online Library, 1998.2. **SimVerb3500**: The citation is: > Daniela Gerz, Ivan VuliÄ‡, Felix Hill, Roi Reichart, and Anna Korhonen. *SimVerb3500: A large-scale evaluation set of verb similarity*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1608.00869, 2016.3. **MEN**: The citation is: > Elia Bruni, Nam-Khanh Tran, and Marco Baroni. *Multimodal distributional semantics*. J. Artif. Intell. Res. (JAIR), 49:1-47, 2014.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
