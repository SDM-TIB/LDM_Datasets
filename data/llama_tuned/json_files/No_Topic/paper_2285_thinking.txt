To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using character overlap to improve language transformation" by Sander Wubben et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of character overlap for improving language transformation, which suggests that datasets related to Middle Dutch and Modern Dutch may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the need for parallel data for their task. They specifically reference the **Middle Dutch - Modern Dutch translation task**, indicating that a dataset is likely involved.In the **data set section**, the authors describe their training data, which consists of various Middle Dutch literary works with their modern Dutch translations. They list several specific works, such as "Van den vos Reynaerdea" and "Beatrijs," which are part of the **Digital Library of Dutch Literature**. This section provides a clear indication of the datasets used for training and evaluation.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the **Digital Library of Dutch Literature** as the source of their training data. The citation for this dataset is:- For the **Digital Library of Dutch Literature**, the citation is: > "Digital Library of Dutch Literature". Available at: http://www.dbnl.orgThis citation is crucial as it provides the source of the dataset used in the study.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the **Digital Library of Dutch Literature**. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
