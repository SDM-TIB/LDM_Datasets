To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The binary trio at SemEval-2019 Task 5: Multitarget Hate Speech Detection in Tweets" by Patricia Chiril et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors focus on hate speech detection in English tweets, which suggests that datasets related to this task are likely discussed.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors mention that their data comes from two corpora, which is a strong indication that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names and details about these datasets in the **data section** of the methods. In this section, the authors describe two datasets:1. **HateEval Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as part of the HatEval task at SemEval2019. It contains English tweets annotated for hate speech against immigrants and women.2. **DATASET++**: This is a new dataset created by the authors, which includes tweets collected from Twitter using specific hashtags. It is designed to improve the performance of hate speech detection models.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **HateEval Dataset**, the citation is: > Valerio Basile, Cristina Bosco, Elisabetta Fersini, Deborah Nozza, Viviana Patti, Francisco Rangel, Paolo Rosso, and Manuela Sanguinetti. *Semeval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in Twitter*. In Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), pages 489a493, 2019.- For the **DATASET++**, since it is a new dataset created by the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation in the references. However, I will include a description of the dataset as it is detailed in the paper.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the established datasets and a description for the new dataset created by the authors. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
