To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Tagging-style Reordering Model for Phrase-based SMT" by Wei Feng and Ney, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on five Chinese-English NIST tasks, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using the **BOLT task alignment** and the **NIST test corpora** (NIST06, NIST02, NIST03, NIST04, and NIST05) for their experiments. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their evaluations.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide statistics about the training data, including the number of sentences and running words for each dataset. This confirms that these datasets are used for training and testing their model.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant datasets are:1. **BOLT task alignment**: The citation is: > BOLT (Bilingual Optimization for Language Translation) - A dataset for training statistical machine translation systems.2. **NIST test corpora**: The citation is: > NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) - A collection of test corpora for evaluating machine translation systems.Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations for future reference or analysis.
