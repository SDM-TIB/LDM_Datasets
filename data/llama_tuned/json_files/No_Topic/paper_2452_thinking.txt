To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Oriented Object Proposals" by Shengfeng He and Rynson W.H. Lau, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in the research.Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of object detection and mention the **PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset** again, confirming its importance in their experiments.In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. They explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the **PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset** and also mention the **Freestyle Motocross dataset** for evaluating the rotation invariant property of their method. This indicates that both datasets are crucial for the research.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset**, the citation is: > M. Everingham, L. Gool, C. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The Pascal visual object classes (VOC) challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303a338, 2010.2. For the **Freestyle Motocross dataset**, the citation is: > M. Villamizar, F. Moreno-Noguer, J. Andrade-Cetto, and A. Sanfeliu. *Efficient rotation invariant object detection using boosted random ferns*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1038a1045, 2010.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
