To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Layer rotation: a surprisingly simple indicator of generalization in deep networks" by Simon Carbonnelle and Christophe De Vleeschouwer, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of layer rotation as an indicator of generalization, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention five different tasks and datasets:1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.2. **CIFAR-100**: An extension of CIFAR-10 with 60,000 images in 100 classes.3. **Tiny ImageNet**: A dataset derived from ImageNet, containing 200,000 images for fine-grained image classification.4. **C10-CNN1**: A variant of the CIFAR-10 dataset, specifically designed for the C10-CNN architecture.5. **C100-CNN1**: Another variant of the CIFAR-100 dataset, used for the C100-CNN architecture.In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for their experiments, which reinforces their relevance.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is: > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In CVPR, pages 248a255, 2009.- For **C10-CNN1** and **C100-CNN1**, since they are variants of the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, I will use the same citation as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
