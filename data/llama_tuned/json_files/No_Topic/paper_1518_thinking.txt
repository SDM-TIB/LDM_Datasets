To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CANE: Context-Aware Network Embedding for Relation Modeling" by Chunchao Tu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled **Datasets**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:1. **Cora**: A citation network constructed by Andrew McCallum et al. in 2000, containing 2,277 machine learning papers divided into 7 categories.2. **HepTh**: A citation network from arXiv released by Jure Leskovec et al. in 2005, consisting of 1,038 papers after filtering out those without abstract information.3. **Zhihu**: The largest online Q&A website in China, containing 10,000 active users with their concerned topics as text information.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For **Cora**, the citation is: > Andrew McCallum, Kamal Nigam, Jason Rennie, and Kristie Seymore. *Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning*. Formation Retrieval Journal 3:127a163, 2000.- For **HepTh**, the citation is: > Jure Leskovec, Jon Kleinberg, and Christos Faloutsos. *Graphs over time: densification laws, shrinkage, and community structure*. Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pages 177a187, 2005.- For **Zhihu**, the citation is: > Jure Leskovec, Jon Kleinberg, and Christos Faloutsos. *Graphs over time: densification laws, shrinkage, and community structure*. Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pages 177a187, 2005.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
