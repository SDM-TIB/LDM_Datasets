To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MaCoCu: Massive collection and curation of monolingual and bilingual data: focus on under-resourced languages" by Marta Bañón et al., I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the project, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used or referenced.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the project's goals and the datasets involved. They mention that the project aims to build monolingual and parallel corpora for under-resourced languages, which suggests that datasets are crucial for this endeavor.I will also check the **methodology section** to see if the authors provide specific details about the datasets, such as their sources or characteristics. This section often contains information about the data collection process and the types of datasets used.In the **results section**, the authors may provide updates on the datasets, including their sizes or any notable features. This section can confirm the datasets' relevance and provide additional context.After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.The paper does not explicitly mention specific datasets in the abstract or introduction, but I will continue to the methodology and results sections for more details. If the authors provide a list of datasets or their sources, I will extract that information.In the **results section**, the authors mention that monolingual and parallel corpora have been released for seven out of the ten languages targeted, but they do not specify the datasets used for this purpose. I will need to look for any references to datasets in the methodology or results sections.In summary, my steps will be:1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.2. Focus on the methodology and results sections for detailed descriptions.3. Check the references for full citations of the datasets mentioned.After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
