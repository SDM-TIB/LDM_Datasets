To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mildly Non-Projective Dependency Grammar" by Marco Kuhlmann, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of grammars on five dependency treebanks, which indicates that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **extraction of dependency grammars** sections. The authors mention that they evaluate their grammars on five dependency treebanks, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **extraction of dependency grammars** section. In this paper, the authors describe their extraction technique from dependency treebanks, which is crucial for identifying the datasets used.In the **extraction of dependency grammars** section, the authors mention that they evaluate their grammars on five dependency treebanks. I will note the names of these treebanks as they are likely to be the datasets used for evaluation.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of the dependency treebanks mentioned. The paper references the following treebanks:1. **Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank**: Citation: > Hajić, J., Smrž, O., Zemánek, P., Šnajdauf, J., & Beška, E.

This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
