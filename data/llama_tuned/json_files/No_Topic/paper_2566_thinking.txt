To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ICARUS for intonation" by Markus G. A. Gartner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the ICARUS tool, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of manual annotation in intonation research and mentions the use of various annotation layers, but it does not provide specific dataset names. I will continue to the **methodology and data representation sections** to see if datasets are detailed there.In the **Data Representation section**, the authors describe the data formats used by ICARUS, including the 2011 and 2012 CoNLL shared tasks. This indicates that these tasks likely involve datasets, so I will look for their names and details.In the **Visualization section**, the authors reference the DIRNDL corpus, which is used for analyzing adjective-noun sequences. This is a strong indication that this corpus is a dataset relevant to their research.Now, I will check the **related work and conclusion sections** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned. The authors reference the DIRNDL corpus again, confirming its significance in their work.Finally, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for the datasets identified:1. **DIRNDL Corpus**: The citation is: > Anders BjÃ¶rkelund, Kerstin Eckart, Arndt Riester, Nadja Schaufier, and Katrin Schweitzer. *The Extended DIRNDL Corpus as a Resource for Coreference and Bridging Resolution*. In LREC, 2014.2. **2011 and 2012 CoNLL Shared Tasks**: The citation is: > Sameer Pradhan, Lance Ramshaw, Mitchell Marcus, Martha Palmer, Ralph Weischedel, and Nianwen Xue. *CoNLL-2011 Shared Task: Modeling Unrestricted Coreference in OntoNotes*. In CoNLL: Shared Task, 2011.3. **Tones and Break Indices (ToBI) System**: The citation is: > Mary Beckman and Julia Hirschberg. *The ToBI Annotation Conventions*. 1999.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
