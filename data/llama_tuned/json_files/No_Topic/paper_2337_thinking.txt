To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building OCR/NER Test Collections" by Dawn Lawrie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the creation of an OCR-NER test collection, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of OCR and NER tasks.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets or provide context about the datasets used in their research. The introduction mentions the use of the **Renmin Ribao Newspaper** for the OCR-NER collection, indicating that this is a key dataset for their work.In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the process of creating the OCR-NER collection, specifically mentioning that they used the **Renmin Ribao Newspaper** for their experiments. This confirms that this dataset is central to their research.I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional datasets or performance metrics related to the datasets used. They mention the **Renmin OCR-NER Collection** and provide details about its structure and content, which reinforces its significance.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Renmin Ribao Newspaper**. The citation is as follows:> Lawrie, D., Mayfield, J., & Etter, D. (2020). Building OCR/NER Test Collections. In Proceedings of the 12th Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2020), pages 4639a4646. Marseille, France. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).Available at: http://paper.people.com.cn/After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the **Renmin OCR-NER Collection** with its citation, ensuring that I include all relevant details for future reference or processing.
