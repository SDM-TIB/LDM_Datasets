To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sentiment Analysis for Low Resource Languages: A Study on Informal Indonesian Tweets" by Tuan Anh Le et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected 4,000 manually labeled tweets, which suggests that this is a dataset used in their study.Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically the subsection titled **4.1 Data Collection**. Here, the authors describe the dataset in detail: they collected 4,000 manually labeled tweets from Twitter Public Streams using a Python script and Tweepy package. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including the number of tweets and the context in which they were collected.I will also check the **data labeling section** to confirm the types of labels used for the tweets. The authors mention that they labeled the tweets into eight categories, which further confirms the dataset's structure.Now, I will look for the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the following sources for the tweets:1. **Twitter API**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for the tweets themselves, as they are collected from Twitter's public streams. However, the authors mention using the Twitter API for data collection.2. **Wikipedia data**: The authors also mention using 61,374,640 Indonesian tokens from Wikipedia for building a word2vec model. I will need to find the citation for this dataset.3. **Emoji definitions**: The authors collected 1,694 emoji definitions for normalization. I will look for the citation related to this dataset.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as accurately as possible. The citations will be formatted according to the requirements of the dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.
