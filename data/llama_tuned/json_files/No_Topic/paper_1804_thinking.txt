To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implicit/Explicit Messages in Offensive and Abusive Language Detection" by Tommaso Caselli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the creation of a new resource called **AbuseEval v1.0**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In the introduction, the authors mention the **OLID/OffensEval dataset** and **AbuseEval v1.0**. This indicates that these datasets are central to their research.In the **methods section**, the authors provide more context about the **OLID/OffensEval dataset**, describing it as a collection of English tweets annotated with the target of an offensive message. They also mention that they enriched this dataset by manually annotating offensive messages with explicit and implicit labels.Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For **OLID/OffensEval**, the citation is: > Zampieri, M., Malmasi, S., Nakov, P., Rosenthal, S., Farra, N., and Kumar, R. *Predicting the Type and Target of Offensive Posts in Social Media*. In Proceedings of NAACL, pages 1-10, 2019.2. For **AbuseEval v1.0**, the citation is: > Caselli, T., Basile, V., MitroviÄ‡, J., Kartoziyaa, I., and Granitzer, M. *AbuseEval v1.0: A Dataset for Distinguishing Explicit and Implicit Abuse in English*. In Proceedings of LREC 2020, pages 6193a6202.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
