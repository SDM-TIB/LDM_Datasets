To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hardware Compliant Approximate Image Codes" by Da Kuang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed method and its empirical analyses, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using multiple standard datasets for their empirical analyses. I will look for specific dataset names and details.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used:1. **Caltech-101**: A dataset containing 101 object categories with 600 images per category.2. **Caltech-256**: A dataset with 256 object categories, also containing 600 images per category.3. **Pascal VOC a07**: A dataset for object detection and segmentation, containing images for 20 classes.4. **MIT Scenes**: A dataset for scene understanding, containing images for various indoor scenes.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For **Caltech-101**, the citation is: > L. Fei-Fei, R. Fergus, and P. Perona. *Learning generative visual models from few training examples: An incremental Bayesian approach tested on 101 object categories*. Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 106(1):59a70, 2007.- For **Caltech-256**, the citation is: > G. Griffin, A. Holub, and P. Perona. *Caltech-256 object category dataset*. 2007.- For **Pascal VOC a07**, the citation is: > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The Pascal visual object classes (VOC) challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303a338, 2010.- For **MIT Scenes**, the citation is: > A. Quattoni and A. Torralba. *Recognizing indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 413a420, 2009.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
