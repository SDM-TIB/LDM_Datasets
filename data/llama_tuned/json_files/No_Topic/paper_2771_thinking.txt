To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GBD-NER at PARSEME Shared Task 2018: Multiword Expression Detection Using Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory Networks and Graph-Based Decoding" by Tiberiu Boros and Ruxandra Burtica, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental validation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their approach using standard MWE corpora supplied in the PARSEME Shared Task, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental validation section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they validated their approach using multilingual corpora provided by the PARSEME corpus, which covers 19 languages and is in CUPT format. This is a clear indication of the datasets used.In the **References section**, I will look for the full citation of the PARSEME corpus. The authors reference the PARSEME Shared Task, which is a well-known benchmark for multiword expression detection. The citation for the PARSEME Shared Task is:> Carlos Ramisch, Silvio Ricardo Cordeiro, Agata Savary, Veronika Vincze, Verginica Barbu Mititelu, Archna Bhatia, Maja Buljan, Marie Candito, Polona Gantar, Voula Giouli, Tunga Gungor, Abdelati Hawwari, UxoaIEnurrieta, Jolanta KovalevskaitEe, Simon Krek, Timm Lichte, Chaya Liebeskind, Johanna Monti, Carla Parra Es-cartA An, Behrang QasemiZadeh, Renata Ramisch, Nathan Schneider, Ivelina Stoyanova, Ashwini Vaidya, and Abigail Walsh. *Edition 1.1 of the PARSEME Shared Task on Automatic Identification of Verbal Multiword Expressions*. In Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Linguistic Annotation, Multiword Expressions and Constructions (LAW-MWE-CxG-2018), Santa Fe, USA, August 25-26, 2018. Association for Computational Linguistics.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the PARSEME corpus, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
