To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Better exploitation of BERT for few-shot event detection" by Aboubacar Tuo, Romaric BesanÃ§on, Olivier Ferret, and Julien Tourille, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of BERT for few-shot event detection, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **FewEvent corpus** for their experiments. This is a key dataset for their work.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FewEvent corpus. The citation is as follows:> Deng, S., Zhang, N., Kang, J., Zhang, Y., Zhang, W., & Chen, H. (2020). Meta-Learning with Dynamic-Memory-Based Prototypical Network for Few-Shot Event Detection. In Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, p. 151a159, Houston TX USA: ACM. DOI: 10.1145/3336191.3371796Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its reference from the paper.
