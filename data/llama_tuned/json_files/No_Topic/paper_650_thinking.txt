To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compositional Mechanisms of Japanese Numeral Classifiers" by Miho Mano, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the examination of numeral classifiers in Japanese, which suggests that datasets related to these classifiers may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the author mentions various numeral classifiers in Japanese and references previous studies, but does not specify any datasets. I will need to look for more detailed information in the methodology or results sections.In the **experiments section**, the author discusses the lexical structures of Japanese numeral classifiers and the compositional mechanisms but does not mention any specific datasets. However, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous studies or methodologies used in the paper.After reviewing the paper, it appears that the author does not explicitly mention any datasets used for experiments or analysis. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper, as no specific datasets are referenced or described in detail.In summary, I will document that there are no datasets extracted from this paper, as the focus is on theoretical analysis rather than empirical data collection.
