To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PERIN: Permutation-invariant Semantic Parsing in PERIND" by David Samuel and Milan Straka, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the PERIN model and its performance across various frameworks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the evaluation.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction mentions the participation in the CoNLL2020 shared task and the use of multiple frameworks, but it does not explicitly name any datasets.In the **methods section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors refer to the CoNLL2020 shared task, which is a shared task for semantic parsing, but they do not specify the datasets used. However, they do mention that their model was evaluated on five different frameworks, which implies that datasets are associated with these frameworks.I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any insights into the datasets used for evaluation. They mention that their model achieved high performance across various frameworks, but again, no specific datasets are named.In the **references section**, I will look for any citations related to the datasets or frameworks mentioned. The references include various works related to semantic parsing and frameworks, but they do not provide specific dataset citations.Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will summarize the findings:1. **CoNLL2020 shared task**: This is a shared task for semantic parsing, but it does not specify the datasets used.2. **Frameworks**: The paper mentions five frameworks (AMR, DRG, EDS, PTG, and UCCA), but it does not provide dataset names or citations for these frameworks.Finally, I will note that the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, which is a significant limitation in my extraction process. Therefore, I will conclude that the paper does not provide enough information to create dataset entries with full citations.
