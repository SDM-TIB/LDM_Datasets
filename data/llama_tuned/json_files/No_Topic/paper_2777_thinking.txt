To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrating Language and Vision to Generate Natural Language Descriptions of Videos in the Wild" by Jesse Thomason et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a large collection of YouTube videos, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods** sections, particularly the subsection titled **3.1 Video Dataset**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments: **YouTube video dataset collected by Chen and Dolan (2011)**. This dataset consists of 1,967 short YouTube video clips paired with multiple human-generated natural-language descriptions.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for this dataset. The relevant citation is:- For the **YouTube video dataset**, the citation is: > David L. Chen and William B. Dolan. *Collecting highly parallel data for paraphrase evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies-Volume 1, pages 190a200, 2011.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:1. **YouTube video dataset**: This dataset contains 1,967 short YouTube video clips paired with multiple human-generated natural-language descriptions. The video clips are 10 to 25 seconds in duration and typically consist of a single activity.Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
