To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Mid-level Filters for Person Re-identification" by Rui Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their approach on the **VIPeR dataset and the CUHK01 dataset**, which suggests that these are the datasets used for evaluation.Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **introduction**. The authors mention that they evaluate their method on these datasets, but I need to gather more information about their characteristics and the context in which they were used.In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets. They describe the **VIPeR dataset** as containing 632 pedestrian pairs with images from different camera views, and the **CUHK01 dataset** as containing 971 persons with images from two camera views. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' structure and purpose.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **VIPeR dataset**, the citation is: > D. Gray, S. Brennan, and H. Tao. *Evaluating appearance models for recognition, reacquisition, and tracking*. In PETS, 2007.2. For the **CUHK01 dataset**, the citation is: > W. Li, R. Zhao, and X. Wang. *Human reidentification with transferred metric learning*. In ACCV, 2012.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their descriptions and citations.
