To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Bilinear Learning for RGB-D Action Recognition" by Jian-Fang Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two public benchmark RGB-D action sets, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention two datasets:1. **NTU RGB+D Dataset**: This dataset is described as being collected for RGB-D human action recognition, containing over 56,000 action samples across 40 subjects performing 60 different actions. It is noted for its large number of action classes, views, and samples with significant intra-class variations.2. **SYSU 3D HOI Dataset**: This dataset is collected for studying complex actions involving human-object interactions, consisting of 480 samples from 6 pairs of interaction actions. It is highlighted for its challenging nature due to similar object contexts and interactive motions.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For the **NTU RGB+D Dataset**, the citation is: > Shahroudy, A., Ng, T. T., Gong, Y., & Wang, G. *NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1604.02808, 2016.- For the **SYSU 3D HOI Dataset**, the citation is: > Hu, J. F., Zheng, W. S., Ma, L., Wang, G., & Lai, J. *Real-time RGB-D activity prediction by soft regression*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 280a296, 2016.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
