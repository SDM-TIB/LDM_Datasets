To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MuST-C: a Multilingual Speech Translation Corpus" by Mattia Antonino Di Gangi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a multilingual speech translation corpus, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly those related to speech and translation tasks.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets or provide context about the datasets used in their research. The introduction discusses the challenges of speech translation and mentions the scarcity of publicly available training corpora, hinting at the datasets being utilized for training and evaluation.In the **corpus creation methodology section**, the authors describe the process of creating MuST-C, which includes the use of English TED Talks for transcription and translation. This indicates that TED Talks are a primary dataset for their corpus, but I need to confirm if there are other datasets mentioned.I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors reference any additional datasets used for evaluation or comparison. They mention using the TED-derived English-German IWSLT18 corpus and the English-German subset of MuST-C derived from the same TED Talks. This suggests that these datasets are part of their evaluation process.Now, I will look at the **references section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:1. **TED Talks**: The authors do not provide a formal citation for the TED Talks dataset, as it is a publicly available resource. However, I can note that it is a collection of talks from TED Talks, which can be accessed at the TED website.2. **TED-derived English-German IWSLT18 corpus**: The citation for this dataset is: > Jan Niehues, Roldano Cattoni, Sebastian St√ºker, Mauro Cettolo, Marco Turchi, and Marcello Federico. *The IWSLT 2018 Evaluation Campaign*. In Proceedings of IWSLT 2018, pages 1-8, Bruges, Belgium, 2018.3. **English-German subset of MuST-C**: This dataset is derived from the same TED Talks used to build the IWSLT18 corpus, so it shares the same citation as the IWSLT18 corpus.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
