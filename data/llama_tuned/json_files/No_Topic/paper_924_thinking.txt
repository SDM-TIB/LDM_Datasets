To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Scene Geometry for Visual Localization in Challenging Conditions" by Nathan Piasco et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a new approach for image-based localization, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, particularly in the context of challenging conditions.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Oxford Robotcar public dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their method in various localization scenarios.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of images and the conditions under which they were collected. They specify that the dataset consists of 1688 images taken every 5 meters along a path of 2 km, which is essential information for a dataset entry.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Oxford Robotcar dataset. The citation is as follows:> W. Maddern, G. Pascoe, C. Linegar, and P. Newman. *1 year, 1000 km: The Oxford RobotCar dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR), 2016.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Oxford Robotcar dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Oxford Robotcar dataset, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
