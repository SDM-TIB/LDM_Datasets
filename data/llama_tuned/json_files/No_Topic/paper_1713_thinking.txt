To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interoperability of cross-lingual and cross-document event detection" by Piek Vossen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their system on a **Wikinews corpus of 120 English articles that have been manually translated to Spanish and Dutch**. This suggests that the dataset is significant for their experiments.Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **introduction**. The authors mention that they used a publicly available corpus of English Wikinews articles, which is a clear indication of the dataset's name and purpose. They also state that the corpus was manually translated to Spanish and Dutch, which confirms the dataset's multilingual nature.In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the evaluation process, which includes using the **Wikinews corpus** for their experiments. They mention that they applied their pipelines to all 120 articles in each language, which reinforces the dataset's relevance.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Wikinews corpus**. The citation is as follows:> Piek Vossen, Egoitz Laparra, Itziar Aldabe, and German Rigau. *Interoperability of cross-lingual and cross-document event detection*. In Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on EVENTS at the NAACL-HLT 2015, pages 108a116, Denver, Colorado, June 4, 2015.Since the paper does not provide a specific citation for the **Wikinews corpus** in the references, I will note that it is a publicly available corpus and reference the original source of the dataset, which is the Wikinews website itself.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the **Wikinews corpus**, ensuring to include the full citation and a clear description of the dataset's purpose and content.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or processing.
