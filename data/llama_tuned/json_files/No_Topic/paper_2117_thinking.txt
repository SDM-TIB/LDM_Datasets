To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SemEval-2016 Task 7: Determining Sentiment Intensity of English and Arabic Phrases" by Svetlana Kiritchenko and Saif M. Mohammad, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created three datasets for sentiment analysis, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **datasets section** (section 3) where the authors describe the datasets used in their task. Here, they mention three datasets:1. **General English Sentiment Modifiers Set**: This dataset includes English single words and multi-word phrases manually annotated for sentiment intensity scores. The authors specify that it contains 2,999 terms.2. **English Twitter Mixed Polarity Set**: This dataset focuses on English phrases with opposing polarity terms, including single-word terms. It consists of 1,269 terms and is derived from a corpus of tweets.3. **Arabic Twitter Set**: This dataset includes single words and phrases commonly found in Arabic tweets, with 1,366 terms. The phrases are formed by combining a negator and a word.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For the **General English Sentiment Modifiers Set**, the citation is: > Svetlana Kiritchenko and Saif M. Mohammad. *Capturing reliable in-grained sentiment associations*. In Proceedings of the 15th Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (NAACL), pages 1-10, 2016.- For the **English Twitter Mixed Polarity Set**, the citation is: > Svetlana Kiritchenko and Saif M. Mohammad. *Happy accident: A sentiment composition lexicon for opposing polarity phrases*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC), pages 1-8, 2016.- For the **Arabic Twitter Set**, the citation is: > Svetlana Kiritchenko and Saif M. Mohammad. *The effect of negators, modals, and degree adverbs on sentiment composition*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis (WASSA), pages 1-8, 2016.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their respective citations.
