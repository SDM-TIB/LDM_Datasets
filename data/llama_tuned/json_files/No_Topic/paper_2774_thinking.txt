To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structure-from-Motion Revisited" by Johannes L. SchÃ¶nberger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed method and its evaluation on various datasets, indicating that datasets are indeed used for testing.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention that they ran experiments on a large variety of datasets, which suggests that multiple datasets will be listed.In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they evaluated their method on **17 datasets** containing a total of **144,953 unordered Internet photos**. This indicates that there are multiple datasets, but I need to find their specific names and details.Now, I will look for a **datasets table or a list of datasets** within the paper. The authors mention that the datasets are used for evaluating their proposed method, but they do not provide a formal table or list in the text. Instead, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The paper references several datasets, including:1. **Quad**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of their method. The citation is: > D. Crandall, A. Owens, N. Snavely, and D. P. Huttenlocher. *Discrete-Continuous Optimization for Large-Scale Structure from Motion*. CVPR, 2011.2. **Theia**: This dataset is also used for evaluation. The citation is: > C. Sweeney. *Theia multiview geometry library: Tutorial & reference*. http://theia-sfm.org.3. **Dubrovnik**: This dataset is another one of the datasets used in their experiments. The citation is: > Y. Li, N. Snavely, and D. P. Huttenlocher. *Location recognition using prioritized feature matching*. ECCV, 2010.4. **Alamo**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the experiments. The citation is: > K. Wilson and N. Snavely. *Robust global translations with DfM*. ECCV, 2014.5. **Ellis Island**: This dataset is also used for evaluation. The citation is: > K. Wilson and N. Snavely. *Robust global translations with DfM*. ECCV, 2014.6. **Gendarmenmarkt**: This dataset is another dataset used in their experiments. The citation is: > K. Wilson and N. Snavely. *Robust global translations with DfM*. ECCV, 2014.7. **Madrid Metropolis**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the evaluation. The citation is: > K. Wilson and N. Snavely. *Robust global translations with DfM*. ECCV, 2014.8. **Montreal Notre Dame**: This dataset is used for testing the proposed method. The citation is: > K. Wilson and N. Snavely. *Robust global translations with DfM*. ECCV, 2014.9. **NYC Library**: This dataset is another dataset used in the experiments. The citation is: > K. Wilson and N. Snavely. *Robust global translations with DfM*. ECCV, 2014.10. **Piazza del Popolo**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the evaluation. The citation is: > K. Wilson and N. Snavely. *Robust global translations with DfM*. ECCV, 2014.11. **Piccadilly**: This dataset is used for testing the proposed method. The citation is: > K. Wilson and N. Snavely. *Robust global translations with DfM*. ECCV, 2014.12. **Roman Forum**: This dataset is another dataset used in the experiments. The citation is: > K. Wilson and N. Snavely. *Robust global translations with DfM*. ECCV, 2014.13. **Tower of London**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the evaluation. The citation is: > K. Wilson and N. Snavely. *Robust global translations with DfM*. ECCV, 2014.14. **Trafalgar**: This dataset is used for testing the proposed method. The citation is: > K. Wilson and N. Snavely. *Robust global translations with DfM*. ECCV, 2014.15. **Union Square**: This dataset is another dataset used in the experiments. The citation is: > K. Wilson and N. Snavely. *Robust global translations with DfM*. ECCV, 2014.16. **Vienna Cathedral**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the evaluation. The citation is: > K. Wilson and N. Snavely. *Robust global translations with DfM*. ECCV, 2014.17. **Yorkminster**: This dataset is used for testing the proposed method. The citation is: > K. Wilson and N. Snavely. *Robust global translations with DfM*. ECCV, 2014.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
