To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rakutenas Participation in WAT 2022: Parallel Dataset Filtering by Leveraging Vocabulary Heterogeneity" by Alberto Poncelas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data selection sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the WAT 2022 shared translation task, which suggests that datasets related to this task may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **data selection section** where the authors describe their approach to selecting domain-specific sentences from the JParaCrawl dataset. They mention using JParaCrawl v3.0 as the source of data, which is a key dataset for their experiments.In the **data selection section**, the authors specify that they extracted sentences from JParaCrawl v3.0, which is a web-based English-Japanese parallel corpus. This is a clear indication of a dataset used in their work.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the JParaCrawl dataset. The relevant citation is:- For **JParaCrawl**, the citation is: > Makoto Morishita, Jun Suzuki, and Masaaki Nagata. *JParaCrawl: A large scale web-based English-Japanese parallel corpus*. In Proceedings of The 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC 2020), pages 3603a3609, Marseille, France, 2020.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. The dataset extracted is:1. **JParaCrawl v3.0**: A web-based English-Japanese parallel corpus used for domain-specific data selection in the WAT 2022 shared translation task.Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for any further analysis or reporting.
