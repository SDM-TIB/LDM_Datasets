To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural sentence generation from formal semantics" by Kana Manome et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of logical formulas for sentence generation, which suggests that datasets related to logical representations might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention creating a dataset annotated with logical formulas from the **SNLI corpus**. This is a significant dataset for their experiments, as they describe how they used 50,000 hypothesis sentences from the training portion of the SNLI corpus to create their dataset.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SNLI corpus. The citation is as follows:> Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 632a642, 2015.Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the SNLI corpus, ensuring to include the full citation as required. The dataset entry will include the dataset name, description, and citation.Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in the specified format for further processing or review.
