To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Debiasing Averaged Stochastic Gradient Descent to handle missing values" by Aude Sportisse et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on real datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:1. **TraumaBase Dataset**: This dataset is used for modeling the level of platelet upon arrival at the hospital from clinical data of 15,785 patients. The authors describe the dataset's structure and the variables included, which is crucial for understanding its application in their research.2. **Superconductivity Dataset**: This dataset contains 81 quantitative features from 21,263 superconductors, and the authors describe how they introduced missing values to evaluate their method's performance on this dataset.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For the **TraumaBase Dataset**, the citation is: > APHP TraumaBase R Group. *TraumaBase R Group*. Available at: https://www.ap-hip.fr/traumabase/- For the **Superconductivity Dataset**, the citation is: > Superconductivity dataset. Available at: https://github.com/AudeSportisse/SGD-NANow that I have gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
