To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection of Community Managers: A Multilingual Study based on a Junk Food Corpus" by Johan Ferguth et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a multilingual corpus related to junk food, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the context and purpose of their research. They mention the creation of a multilingual corpus, specifically stating that they developed four corpora in different languages: English, Chinese, French, and Russian. This is a strong indication that datasets are present, and I need to find their names.In the **corpus and methodology section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets. They describe the datasets as follows:1. **Junk Food Corpus**: This is the primary dataset used for their study, containing multilingual text data from various sources, including forums and websites related to junk food. The authors mention that they collected a total of 300 to 700 commentaires (comments) for annotation, which indicates the dataset's size and purpose.2. **Corpus de langues diffArentes**: This dataset includes text data in multiple languages, specifically mentioning English, Chinese, French, and Russian. The authors describe how they collected this dataset from various sources, including forums and websites.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors do not provide specific citations for the datasets in the references, but they do mention the sources from which they collected the data. However, I will note that the Junk Food Corpus is likely based on their own collection of data, and the other datasets are derived from publicly available sources.The Junk Food Corpus is not explicitly cited in the references, but it is described as a custom dataset created for this study. The other datasets are not formally cited either, as they are likely derived from publicly available sources such as forums and websites.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, noting that while the Junk Food Corpus is the primary dataset, the other datasets are not formally cited. I will ensure to include the description of the datasets as per the paper's content, focusing on the context and purpose of each dataset.In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:1. **Junk Food Corpus**: A multilingual dataset containing text data related to junk food, collected from forums and websites.2. **Corpus de langues diffArentes**: A dataset containing text data in multiple languages (English, Chinese, French, and Russian), collected from various sources.Now, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the descriptions and citations for each dataset as accurately as possible.
