To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SIMMC 2.0: A task-oriented dialog dataset for immersive multimodal conversations" by Satwik Kottur et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the SIMMC 2.0 dataset, indicating that it is a task-oriented dialog dataset for immersive multimodal conversations.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that SIMMC 2.0 builds upon the previous SIMMC 1.0 dataset, which is a significant clue that I need to include in my extraction.In the **methods section**, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the SIMMC 2.0 dataset, including its structure, the number of dialogues, and the types of objects involved. This section will confirm the dataset's details and provide context for its use in their experiments.I will also check the **experiments section** to see how the dataset is utilized in the evaluation of their proposed model. This will help me understand the dataset's significance in the research and confirm its relevance to the tasks mentioned.In the **related work section**, I will look for any references to other datasets that may be relevant to the SIMMC 2.0 dataset. This could provide additional context or comparisons that might be useful for my extraction.Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the SIMMC 2.0 dataset. The citation is as follows:> Satwik Kottur, Seungwhan Moon, Alborz Geramifard, and Babak Damavandi. *SIMMC 2.0: A task-oriented dialog dataset for immersive multimodal conversations*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2021), Virtual Event / Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, 7-11 November, 2021, pages 4903a4912. Association for Computational Linguistics.After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for each dataset. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation to provide a comprehensive overview of the SIMMC 2.0 dataset.
