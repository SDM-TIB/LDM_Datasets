To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Graph Based Semi-Supervised Approach for Analysis of Derivational Nouns in Sanskrit" by Amrith Krishna et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a semi-supervised approach for analyzing derivational nouns in Sanskrit, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets or resources used for their analysis. The introduction references the availability of digitized versions of Sanskrit corpora, which indicates that datasets are part of the study.In the **methods section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors mention using multiple lexicons and corpora, specifically naming:1. **IndoWordNet**: A lexical database for Sanskrit.2. **Sanskrit2**: A digitized version of the Monier Williams Sanskrit-English dictionary.3. **Apte Sanskrit-Sanskrit Dictionary**: A comprehensive dictionary for Sanskrit.4. **Sanskrit Heritage Engine**: A digital platform for Sanskrit processing.I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used for evaluation. The authors state that they obtained close to 170,000 unique word lemmas from the combined resources, which includes the lexicons and corpora mentioned earlier.Now, I will consult the **references section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For **IndoWordNet**, the citation is: > Malhar Kulkarni, Chaitali Dangarikar, Irawati Kulka-rni, Abhishek Nanda, and Pushpak Bhattacharyya. *Introducing Sanskrit WordNet*. In Proceedings on the 5th Global Wordnet Conference (GWC 2010), Narosa, Mumbai, pages 287a294, 2010.- For **Sanskrit2**, the citation is: > Malhar Kulkarni, Chaitali Dangarikar, Irawati Kulka-rni, Abhishek Nanda, and Pushpak Bhattacharyya. *Introducing Sanskrit WordNet*. In Proceedings on the 5th Global Wordnet Conference (GWC 2010), Narosa, Mumbai, pages 287a294, 2010.- For **Apte Sanskrit-Sanskrit Dictionary**, the citation is: > Pawan Goyal and GAérard Huet. *Design and analysis of a lean interface for sanskrit corpus annotation*. Journal of Language Modelling, 4(2):145a182, 2016.- For **Sanskrit Heritage Engine**, the citation is: > Pawan Goyal and GAérard Huet. *Design and analysis of a lean interface for sanskrit corpus annotation*. Journal of Language Modelling, 4(2):145a182, 2016.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
