To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Psycholinguistic Diagnosis of Language Models: Commonsense Reasoning" by Yan Congyan and Congyan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of psycholinguistic datasets to evaluate language models, indicating that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention two specific datasets:1. **Presupposition Dataset**: This dataset is based on the work by Singh et al. (2016), which includes human behavioral acceptance judgment experiments. The authors extracted 82 items from this dataset, which are cognitively justified and freely available.2. **Scalar Implicature Dataset**: This dataset is referenced from Nieuwland et al. (2010), which includes a Communication sub-scale of the Autism-Spectrum Quotient questionnaire (AQ). The authors extracted 168 items from this dataset, which are relevant for evaluating the language models' performance in understanding pragmatic inferences.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Presupposition Dataset**, the citation is: > Raj Singh, Evelina Fedorenko, Kyle Mahowald, and Edward Gibson. *Accommodating presuppositions is inappropriate in implausible contexts*. Cognitive Science, 40:607a634, 2016.- For the **Scalar Implicature Dataset**, the citation is: > Mante S. Nieuwland, Tali Ditman, and Gina R. Kuiperberg. *On the incrementality of pragmatic processing: An ERP investigation of informativeness and pragmatic abilities*. Journal of Memory and Language, 63:324a346, 2010.Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
