To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning for Image Super Resolution: A Survey" by Wei Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of deep learning techniques for image super resolution, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (if present) or any relevant sections that detail the datasets used for training or evaluation. In this paper, I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.If the paper does not have a dedicated section for datasets, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to datasets. This is crucial as it will provide the necessary information to create full citations for each dataset.After identifying the datasets, I will compile the information, ensuring that I include the following details for each dataset:1. **Name of the dataset**: The official name as it appears in the paper.2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics.3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, formatted according to the style specified in the paper or the relevant citation style.After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper, ready for any downstream applications.
