To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Learning with a Controlled Degree of Task-Adaptive Conditioning" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive simulations based on the **miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets**, which suggests these are the datasets used for evaluation.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. They explicitly mention using **miniImageNet** and **tieredImageNet** for their experiments, confirming their significance in the study.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about how they split the datasets for their experiments, which further confirms the datasets' relevance. They mention using a specific split for **miniImageNet** and **tieredImageNet**, indicating that these datasets are integral to their research.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.The citations I will extract are:- For **miniImageNet**, the citation is: > Olivier Chapelle, Bernhard Schlkopf, and Alexander Zien. *Semi-supervised learning*. 2010.- For **tieredImageNet**, the citation is: > Mengye Ren, Sachin Ravi, Eleni Triantaflou, Jake Snell, Kevin Swersky, Josh B. Tenenbaum, Hugo Larochelle, and Richard S. Zemel. *Meta-learning for semi-supervised few-shot classification*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their proper citations for future reference.
