To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MIE: A Medical Information Extractor towards Medical Dialogues" by Yuanzhe Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for automatically converting medical dialogues into Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and mentions the use of annotated dialogues, indicating that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention collecting doctor-patient dialogues from a popular Chinese online medical consultation website, **Chunyu-Doctor 2**. This is a strong indication that this website serves as the source of the dataset.In the **methods section**, the authors provide details about the annotation process, stating that they annotated **1,120 dialogues** with **18,212 segmented windows** and obtained **more than 40k labels**. This confirms that the dataset is derived from the dialogues collected from Chunyu-Doctor 2.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the source of the dialogues as Chunyu-Doctor 2, which is a popular Chinese online medical consultation website. However, they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset in the references. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is derived from Chunyu-Doctor 2, but I will need to provide a citation for the website itself.Since Chunyu-Doctor 2 is not a traditional dataset with a formal citation, I will cite it as follows:- Chunyu-Doctor 2: A popular Chinese online medical consultation website.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the relevant details and the citation for the source of the dialogues. The dataset entry will include the name of the dataset, a brief description, and the citation for the source of the dialogues.
