To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topical Key Concept Extraction from Folksonomy" by Han Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on folksonomy data from Douban.com Movie, which suggests that this is a dataset used in their research.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention the dataset they used for their experiments:1. **Douban.com Movie Dataset**: This dataset consists of top 250 movies with 1760 tags assigned by users up to June 2012. The authors state that they prepared 1737 tags corresponding to 249 movies for Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analysis.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Douban.com Movie Dataset. The relevant citation is:- For the Douban.com Movie Dataset, the citation is: > Han Xue, Bing Qin, Ting Liu, and Chao Xiang. *Topical Key Concept Extraction from Folksonomy*. In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, pages 480a488, Nagoya, Japan, 14-18 October 2013.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry with the dataset name, description, and citation into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
