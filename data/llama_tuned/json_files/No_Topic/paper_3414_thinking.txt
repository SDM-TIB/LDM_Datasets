To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ARShadowGAN: Shadow Generative Adversarial Network for Augmented Reality in Single Light Scenes" by Daquan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a new dataset for training and evaluating their proposed ARShadowGAN, which suggests that a specific dataset is being introduced.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the need for a shadow image dataset with clues for generating virtual shadows, which implies that they created a dataset for their experiments. In the **methods section**, they describe the construction of the **Shadow-AR dataset**, detailing its composition and the process of collecting images and annotations.In the **Shadow-AR Dataset section**, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the dataset, including the number of quintuples (3,000), the types of images included (synthetic AR images, corresponding AR images, virtual object masks, labeled real-world shadow matting, and labeled occluders), and the annotation process. This section is crucial as it outlines the dataset's structure and purpose.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Shadow-AR dataset**. The authors reference the following datasets in the context of their work, which may be relevant for citation:- **ShapeNet**: The citation is: > Angel X Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, et al. *Shapenet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.- **SBU**: The citation is: > TomÃ¡s F. Yago Vicente, Le Hou, Chen-Ping Yu, Minh Hoai, and Dimitris Samaras. *Large-scale training of shadow detectors with noisily-annotated shadow examples*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 816a832. Springer, 2016.- **SRD**: The citation is: > Liangqiong Qu, Jiandong Tian, Shengfeng He, Yandong Tang, and Rynson WH Lau. *Deshadow: A multi-context embedding deep network for shadow removal*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4067a4075, 2017.- **ISTD**: The citation is: > Jifeng Wang, Xiang Li, and Jian Yang. *Stacked conditional generative adversarial networks for jointly learning shadow detection and shadow removal*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1788a1797, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
