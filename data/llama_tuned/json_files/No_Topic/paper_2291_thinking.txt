To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Open Information Extraction for Spanish Language based on Syntactic Constraints" by Alisa Zhila and Alexander Gelbukh, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses an approach to Open Information Extraction (Open IE) for Spanish, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of evaluating the proposed method.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their evaluation methods. Here, they mention two specific datasets used for their experiments:1. **News Commentary Corpus**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the EXTRHECH system on a parallel dataset of English-Spanish sentences. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of sentences and the annotation process.2. **Raw Web Dataset**: This dataset consists of 159 sentences extracted from the Internet, specifically from CommonCrawl 2012. The authors describe the preprocessing steps and the evaluation metrics used for this dataset.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about how they utilized these datasets, including the number of sentences and the evaluation metrics. This confirms their relevance to the research.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For the **News Commentary Corpus**, the citation is: > Chris Callison-Burch, Philipp Koehn, Christof Monz, and Omar Zaidan. *Findings of the 2011 workshop on statistical machine translation*. In Proceedings of the Sixth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 22a64, Edinburgh, Scotland, July 2011. Association for Computational Linguistics.- For the **Raw Web Dataset**, the citation is: > Marshall Kirkpatrick. *New 5 billion page web index with page rank now available for foundation*. ReadWrite, 2011. Available at: http://readwrite.com/2011/11/07/2011/Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
