To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Statistical Relational Learning Approach to Identifying Evidence Based Medicine Categories" by Vincent Van Asch et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a new language for statistical relational learning and mentions the **NICTA-PIBOSO corpus** for evaluating their approach. This indicates that this corpus is crucial for the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **evaluation sections** to gather more details about the datasets used. In the introduction, the authors reference the **NICTA-PIBOSO corpus** again, confirming its significance in their research. In the **evaluation section**, they explicitly state that they performed experiments on the **NICTA-PIBOSO corpus**, which contains 1,000 medical abstracts manually annotated with an extension of the PICO tagset. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's content and its application in their experiments.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **NICTA-PIBOSO corpus**. The citation is as follows:> Su Nam Kim, David Martinez, Lawrence Cavedon, and Lars Yencken. *Automatic Classification of Sentences to Support Evidence Based Medicine*. BMC Bioinformatics, 12(2):S5, 2011. https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-1750-12-S5Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
