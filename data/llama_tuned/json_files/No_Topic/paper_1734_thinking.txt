To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentiable Ranks and Sorting using Optimal Transport" by Marco Cuturi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of optimal transport for ranking and sorting operations, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for their experiments, specifically for training and testing their models.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
