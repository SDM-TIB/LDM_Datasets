To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamically Composing Domain-Data Selection with Clean-Data Selection by a Co-Curricular Learning" by Wei Wang and Isaac Caswell, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges in neural machine translation and hints at the use of datasets for training and evaluation, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two background datasets and two test domains, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.I will look for specific names and details about these datasets. The paper states that the authors used the **EnglishaFrench Paracrawl data** and the **WMT14 training data** for their experiments. This is a clear indication of the datasets being utilized.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide additional context about the datasets:1. **EnglishaFrench Paracrawl data**: This dataset is described as containing 300 million pairs of data, which is noted as being "severely noisy."2. **WMT14 training data**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 40 million pairs of data, which is considered cleaner than the Paracrawl data.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **EnglishaFrench Paracrawl data**, the citation is: > Kudo, T. (2018). Subword regularization: Improving neural network translation models with multiple subword candidates. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 66a75. Association for Computational Linguistics.- For the **WMT14 training data**, the citation is: > Koehn, P., Khayrallah, H., Heafield, K., & Forcada, M. L. (2018). Findings of the WMT 2018 shared task on parallel corpus filtering. In Proceedings of the Third Conference on Machine Translation, pages 1a8, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
