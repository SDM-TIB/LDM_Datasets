To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoGOAL: A Framework for Automated Machine Learning" by Suilan Estevez-Velarde et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the AutoGOAL framework but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges in machine learning and mentions the framework's capabilities but does not specify datasets used for evaluation.In the **implementation details section**, I will look for any datasets that are explicitly mentioned as being used for testing or evaluation. The authors refer to the use of various datasets in their experiments, but I need to find the specific names and details.After reviewing the **evaluation section**, I will identify the datasets used for performance comparisons. The authors mention that AutoGOAL has been evaluated on classic datasets, including HAHA and MEDDOCAN, which are specific datasets relevant to their experiments.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For **HAHA**, the citation is: > Luis Chiruzzo, S Castro, Mathias Etcheverry, Diego Garat, Juan Jose AÃ±ez Prada, and Aiala Rosa. *Overview of HAHAt iberlef 2019: Humor analysis based on human annotation*. In Proceedings of the Iberian Languages Evaluation Forum (IberLEF 2019), CEUR Workshop Proceedings, CEUR-WS, Bilbao, Spain (9 2019).2. For **MEDDOCAN**, the citation is: > Alicia Lara-Clares and Ana Garcia-Serrano. *Key phrases annotation in medical documents: MEDDOCAN2019 anonymization task*.In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-10, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
