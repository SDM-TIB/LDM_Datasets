To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-Rank Tensors for Verbs in Compositional Distributional Semantics" by Daniel Fried, Tamara Polajnar, and Stephen Clark, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of tensors for verb representation and mentions the need for datasets, indicating that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **corpus data extraction** section, where the authors describe how they extracted SVO triples from a Wikipedia corpus. This section is crucial as it provides details about the datasets used for their experiments.In this section, the authors specify that they extracted SVO triples from an **October 2013 download of Wikipedia**, which is a clear indication of the dataset used. They also mention that they filtered the SVO triples to include 345 distinct verbs and selected up to 600 triples for each verb, resulting in approximately 150,000 SVO triples.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Wikipedia dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the Wikipedia dataset, but I can infer that it is a widely recognized dataset in the field of natural language processing. However, I will note that the dataset is derived from Wikipedia, which is a common source for such datasets.The authors also mention two specific datasets used for evaluation: **GS11** and **KS14**. I will look for their citations in the references section:1. For **GS11**, the citation is: > Edward Grefenstette and Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh. *Experimenting with transitive verbs in a DisCoCat*. In Proceedings of the 2011 Workshop on Geometric Models of Natural Language Semantics (GEMS2011), Edinburgh, Scotland, 2011.2. For **KS14**, the citation is: > Dimitrijs Milajevs, Dimitri Kartsaklis, Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh, and Matthew Purver. *Evaluating neural word representations in tensor-based compositional settings*. In Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2014), 2014.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
