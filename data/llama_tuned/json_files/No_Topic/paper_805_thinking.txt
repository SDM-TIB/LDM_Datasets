To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty-Aware Prediction for Graph Neural Networks" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on six real network datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled **4.1 Datasets**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:1. **Cora Dataset**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, and 7 classes.2. **Citeseer Dataset**: Another citation network dataset with 6,143 nodes, 3,601 edges, and 6 classes.3. **Pubmed Dataset**: A citation network dataset with 19,717 nodes, 43,394 edges, and 3 classes.4. **Coauthor Physics Dataset**: A dataset for co-authorship graphs based on the Microsoft Academic Graph, containing 140,500 nodes, 1,000 edges, and 2 classes.5. **Amazon Computers Dataset**: A co-purchase graph dataset with 1,000 nodes, 500 edges, and 2 classes.6. **Amazon Photo Dataset**: Another co-purchase graph dataset with 1,000 nodes, 500 edges, and 2 classes.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **Cora Dataset**, the citation is: > Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Galligher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93, 2008.- For **Citeseer Dataset**, the citation is: > Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Galligher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93, 2008.- For **Pubmed Dataset**, the citation is: > Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Galligher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93, 2008.- For **Coauthor Physics Dataset**, the citation is: > Oleksandr Shchur, Maximilian Mumme, Aleksandar Bojchevski, and Stephan Gannemann. *Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868, 2018.- For **Amazon Computers Dataset**, the citation is: > Julian McAuley, Christopher T. G. Bart, Qinfeng Shi, and Anton Van Den Hengel. *Recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pages 1a10, 2015.- For **Amazon Photo Dataset**, the citation is: > Julian McAuley, Christopher T. G. Bart, Qinfeng Shi, and Anton Van Den Hengel. *Recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pages 1a10, 2015.After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
