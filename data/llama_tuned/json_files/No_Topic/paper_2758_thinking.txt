To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neuralizing Regular Expressions for Slot Filling" by Chengyue Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three popular slot filling datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4.1), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they list three datasets:1. **ATIS**: This dataset contains English queries for airline services.2. **ATIS-ZH**: The Chinese version of ATIS, also containing English queries for airline services.3. **SNIPS**: A collection of English queries to voice assistants, known for its complexity and large vocabulary.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **ATIS**, the citation is: > Charles T. Hemphill, John J. Godfrey, and George R. Doddington. *The ATIS Spoken Language Systems Pilot Corpus*. In Speech and Natural Language: Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Hidden Valley, Pennsylvania, June 24-27, 1990.- For **ATIS-ZH**, the citation is: > Saab Mansour and Batool Haider. *ATIS seven languages ldc2021t04*. In Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium, 2021.- For **SNIPS**, the citation is: > Alice Coucke, Alaa Saade, Adrien Ball, Thibault Gisselbrecht, Francesco Caltagirone, Thibault Lavril, MaAl Primet, and Joseph Dureau. *SNIPS Voice Platform: An Embedded Spoken Language Understanding System for Private-by-Design Voice Interfaces*. CoRR, abs/1805.10190, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
