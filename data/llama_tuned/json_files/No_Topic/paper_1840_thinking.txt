To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Real-life, French-accented Corpus of Air Traffic Control Communications" by Estelle Delpech et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and corpus description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper describes the creation of the AIRBUS-ATC corpus, which suggests that this is a primary dataset of interest.Next, I will focus on the **corpus description** section, where the authors provide detailed information about the AIRBUS-ATC corpus. They mention that it consists of 59 hours of transcribed English audio, along with linguistic and metadata annotations. This section will likely contain specific details about the dataset's structure and content.In the **existing ATC speech corpora section**, the authors reference several other datasets that are relevant to their work, including the NIST Air Traffic Control Corpus, ATCOSIM, HIWIRE, and the VOCALISE dataset. I will need to extract the details about these datasets as well, including their characteristics and any relevant citations.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.For the **AIRBUS-ATC corpus**, the citation is:> Estelle Delpech, Marion Laignelet, Christophe Pimm, CÃ©line Raynal, Michal Trzosa, and Alexandre Arnold. *A Real-life, French-accented Corpus of Air Traffic Control Communications*. In Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2019.For the **NIST Air Traffic Control Corpus**, the citation is:> Godfrey, J. (1994). *Air Traffic Control Complete LDC94S14A*. Web Download. Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium.For the **ATCOSIM Corpus**, the citation is:> Hofbauer, K., Petrik, S., and Hering, H. (2008). *The ATCOSIM Corpus of Non-Prompted Clean Air Traffic Control Speech*. LREC.For the **HIWIRE Corpus**, the citation is:> Segura, J. C., Ehrette, T., Potamianos, A., Fohr, D., Illina, I., Breton, P.-A., Clot, V., Gemello, R., Matassoni, M., and Maragos, P. (2007). *The HIWIRE database, a noisy and non-native English speech corpus for cockpit communication*. Online. http://www.hiwire.org.For the **VOCALISE dataset**, the citation is:> Graglia, L., Favennec, B., and Arnoux, A. (2005). *VOCALISE: Assessing the impact of data link technology on the R/T channel*. The 24th Digital Avionics Systems Conference, Vol. 1.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
