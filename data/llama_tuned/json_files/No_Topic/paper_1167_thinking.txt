To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Hyperalignment for Multilingual Word Embeddings" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the alignment of word representations across multiple languages, which suggests that datasets related to word embeddings or bilingual lexicons might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks used for evaluation. The introduction discusses the use of pre-trained word vectors and mentions the MUSE test datasets, indicating that these are likely datasets used in the experiments.In the **experimental results section**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on the **MUSE test datasets**, which consist of 5 translations to and from English. This confirms that MUSE is a dataset relevant to their work.I will also check the **related work section** to see if any other datasets are mentioned. The authors reference the MUSE bilingual lexicon, which is built using an automatic translation system, but they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset in the main body of the paper. However, I will look for the citation in the **references section** to ensure I have the full citation for the MUSE datasets.Now, I will gather the necessary information about the MUSE datasets:1. **MUSE Test Datasets**: The authors mention that they evaluate their method on the MUSE test datasets, which consist of 5 translations to and from English. The citation for the MUSE dataset is: > Alexis Conneau, Guillaume Lample, MarcaAurelio Ranzato, Ludovic Denoyer, and HervA e JA egou. *Word translation without parallel data*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.04087, 2017.2. **MUSE Bilingual Lexicon**: The authors refer to the MUSE bilingual lexicon, which is built using an automatic translation system. The citation for the MUSE bilingual lexicon is the same as above, as it is part of the same work.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for both the MUSE datasets and the bilingual lexicon. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
