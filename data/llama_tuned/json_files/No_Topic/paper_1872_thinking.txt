To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Influence of Regional Pronunciation Variation on Children's Spelling and the Potential Benefits of Accent Adapted Spellcheckers" by Emma O'Neill et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used misspelling data from schoolchildren across Ireland, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically **section 3.1 (The Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset was compiled from a collection of surveys of schoolchildren across Ireland, specifically stating that it contains **232 pairs of misspellings and real-word targets**. This is a clear indication of the dataset's name and purpose.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the Zeeko organization, which is likely the source of the dataset. The citation for the dataset is:> Marina Everri and Kirsty Park. *Children's online behaviours in Irish primary and secondary schools*. Technical report, Zeeko, Nova UCD, 2018.Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset in the references, I will use the authors' description of the dataset and the organization from which it was collected to create a structured entry.Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the information gathered, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in future work.
