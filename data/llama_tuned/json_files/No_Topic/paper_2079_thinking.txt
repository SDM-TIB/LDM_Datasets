To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constructing Web-Accessible Semantic Role Labels and Frames for Japanese as Additions to the NPCMJ Parsed Corpus" by Koichi Takeuchi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors are adding semantic role and frame information to the **NINJAL Parsed Corpus of Modern Japanese (NPCMJ)**, which suggests that this corpus is a key dataset for their work.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methodology** sections for more detailed information. The introduction mentions various Japanese language resources, including the **PropBank** and **FrameNet**, which are well-known datasets in the field of natural language processing. However, the primary dataset they are working with is the **NINJAL Parsed Corpus of Modern Japanese (NPCMJ)**, which is explicitly stated as the source of their annotations.In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the annotation process and mention that they are using the **NINJAL Parsed Corpus of Modern Japanese (NPCMJ)** for their annotations. They also reference the **Predicate-argument Thesaurus (PT)**, which is a repository of semantic roles and frames for Japanese predicates, but it is not a dataset in the traditional sense. Instead, it is a resource used for their annotation task.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **NINJAL Parsed Corpus of Modern Japanese (NPCMJ)**. The citation is:> NINJAL. *NINJAL Parsed Corpus of Modern Japanese*. Technical report, National Institute and Linguistics, 2016. http://npcmj.ninjal.ac.jp/ (accessed 2019/11/30).This citation is crucial as it provides the necessary information about the dataset used in their research.Finally, I will summarize the datasets identified:1. **NINJAL Parsed Corpus of Modern Japanese (NPCMJ)**: A web-accessible parsed corpus used for annotating semantic roles and frames in Japanese.2. **Predicate-argument Thesaurus (PT)**: A repository of semantic roles and frames for Japanese predicates, used for annotating the NPCMJ corpus.Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
