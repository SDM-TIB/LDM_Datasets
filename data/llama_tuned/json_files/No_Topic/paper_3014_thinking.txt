To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DualGraph: A graph-based method for reasoning about label noise" by Haiyang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they state that they conducted experiments on the following datasets:1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.2. **CIFAR-100**: An extension of CIFAR-10, containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes.3. **Clothing1M**: A large-scale real-world dataset with 1 million images of clothing, classified into 14 categories, but noted for its noisy labels.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. University of Toronto, 2012.- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. University of Toronto, 2012.- For **Clothing1M**, the citation is: > Tong Xiao, Tian Xia, Yi Yang, Chang Huang, and Xiaogang Wang. *Learning from massive noisy labeled data for image classification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2691a2699, 2015.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
