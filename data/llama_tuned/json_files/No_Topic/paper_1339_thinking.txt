To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReVal: A Simple and Effective Machine Translation Evaluation Metric Based on Recurrent Neural Networks" by Rohit Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a new metric for machine translation evaluation, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction for more context.In the **introduction**, the authors mention that their metric is based on dense vector spaces and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), but they do not specify any datasets used for training or evaluation. I will continue to the **evaluation metric section** to see if datasets are mentioned there.Next, I will focus on the **evaluation metric section** where the authors describe their approach and the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention that they derived training data from the **WMT-13 human evaluation rankings** and also reference the **SICK dataset** for evaluating semantic similarity. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For **WMT-13**, the citation is: > Ondrej Bojar, Christian Buck, Chris Callison-Burch, Christian Federmann, Barry Haddow, Philipp Koehn, Christof Monz, Matt Post, Radu Soricut. *Findings of the 2013 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1a44, Soia, Bulgaria, August 2013.2. For **SICK**, the citation is: > Marco Marelli, Stefano Menini, Marco Baroni, Luisa Bentivogli, Raffaella Bernardi, and Roberto Zamparelli. *A SICK cure for the evaluation of compositional distributional semantic models*. In Proceedings of LREC 2014.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
