To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images based on a modified DarkCovidNet model" by Dawit A. Kiros et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a model for COVID-19 diagnosis using chest X-ray images, which suggests that datasets related to these images are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets or sources of data. The introduction discusses the COVID-19 pandemic and mentions the use of chest X-ray images, but it does not provide specific dataset names.In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the dataset used for training their model. They mention that they collected over 10,000 COVID-19 X-ray images, which is a significant dataset for their research. However, they do not provide a formal name for this dataset in the introduction or methodology, so I will need to look for more details in the results or discussion sections.I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors provide any additional context or references to datasets. They mention using images from various sources, including the Cohen JP dataset and the COVID-19 Radiography Database, but again, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations in these sections.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the following datasets:1. **Cohen JP Dataset**: The citation is: > Cohen JP. *COVID-19 Image Data Collection*. GitHub, 2020.2. **COVID-19 Radiography Database**: The citation is: > Chowdhury MEH, Rahman T, Khandakar A, Mazhar R, Kadir MA, Mahbub ZB, Islam KR, Khan MS, Iqbal MBI, Al-Emadi N, Reaz MBI. *Can AI help in screening Viral and COVID-19 pneumonia?*. arXiv preprint, 29 Mar 2020.3. **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)**: The citation is: > Wang X, Peng Y, Lu L, Lu Z, Bagheri M, Summers RM. *ChestX-ray8: Hospital scale chest X-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution and further research.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for clarity and future reference.
