To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diversity Augmented Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Multimodal Image-to-Image Translation" by Jun-Yan Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention several datasets used for their experiments, including:1. **Yosemite Summer Winter Dataset**: This dataset is used for two-domain image-to-image translation tasks.2. **DogCat Dataset**: Another dataset used for two-domain image-to-image translation tasks.3. **Alps Seasonal Transfer Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for multi-domain image-to-image translation tasks.4. **Image Weather Conditions Dataset**: This dataset is also used for multi-domain image-to-image translation tasks.5. **AFHQ Dataset**: This dataset is used for multi-domain image-to-image translation tasks.6. **WikiArts Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for multi-domain image-to-image translation tasks.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:- For the **Yosemite Summer Winter Dataset**, the citation is: > Jun-Yan Zhu, Taesung Park, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A. Efros. *Unpaired image-to-image translation using cycle-consistent adversarial networks*. In 2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1-8, 2017.- For the **DogCat Dataset**, the citation is: > Hsin-Ying Lee, Hung-Yu Tseng, Jia-Bin Huang, Maneesh Singh, and Ming-Hsuan Yang. *Diverse image-to-image translation via disentangled representations*. In The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2018.- For the **Alps Seasonal Transfer Dataset**, the citation is: > Anoosheh, A., Agustsson, E., Timofte, R., & Van Gool, L. (2018). *Combogan: Unrestrained scalability for image domain translation*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshops, 6, 8.- For the **Image Weather Conditions Dataset**, the citation is: > Wei-Ta Chu, Xiang-You Zheng, and Ding-Shiuan Ding. *Camera as weather sensor: Estimating weather information from single images*. Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation, 6, 8, 2017.- For the **AFHQ Dataset**, the citation is: > Jun-Yan Zhu, Richard Zhang, Deepak Pathak, Trevor Darrell, Alexei A. Efros, Oliver Wang, and Eli Shechtman. *Toward multimodal image-to-image translation*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 30 (NeurIPS), 2017.- For the **WikiArts Dataset**, the citation is: > Jun-Yan Zhu, Richard Zhang, Deepak Pathak, Trevor Darrell, Alexei A. Efros, Oliver Wang, and Eli Shechtman. *Toward multimodal image-to-image translation*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 30 (NeurIPS), 2017.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
