To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Similarity-Based Non-Scorable Response Detection for Automated Speech Scoring" by Su-Youn Yoon and Shasha Xie, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of automated speech scoring and mentions the use of a collection of responses from an international English language assessment, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **data section** (section 3) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their study. Here, they describe two datasets:1. **ASR Set**: This dataset consists of approximately 48,000 responses collected from 8,000 non-native speakers. It is used for training the automated speech recognizer (ASR).2. **FM Set**: This dataset contains 11,560 responses collected from 24 items, with a total of 1,560 non-scorable responses (NS responses). It is used for training and evaluating the filtering model.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors do not provide specific citations for the datasets in the text, but I can infer that the ASR Set and FM Set are likely derived from a specific assessment tool or resource. However, I will note that the paper does not provide formal citations for these datasets, which is common in research papers where datasets may not be publicly available or may be proprietary.Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the descriptions and any relevant details provided in the paper. Since the datasets are not formally cited, I will note that they are based on the authors' own collection of responses and may not have a formal citation like a traditional dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format, ensuring that I include the necessary details and citations where applicable.
