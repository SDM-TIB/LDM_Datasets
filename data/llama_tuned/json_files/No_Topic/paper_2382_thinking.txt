To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nature and Causes of Observed MT Errors" by Maja Popović, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the analysis of MT errors, which suggests that datasets related to machine translation are involved.Next, I will focus on the **data sets section** (section 2), where the author explicitly mentions two publicly available datasets used for the analysis. The datasets are described as follows:1. **DCU Dataset**: This dataset consists of English user reviews translated into Croatian and Serbian, with a total of 15 evaluators participating in the annotation process. It includes outputs from ten different MT systems and highlights errors in both adequacy and comprehension.2. **HU Dataset**: This dataset contains English TED talks translated into German, annotated by ten evaluators, focusing on errors without a specific quality criterion. The dataset is used to improve an NMT system.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **DCU Dataset**, the citation is: > Popović, M. (2020a). Informative manual evaluation of machine translation output. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 20), Online.- For the **HU Dataset**, the citation is: > Kreutzer, J., Bastings, J., and Riezler, S. (2020). Correct Me If You Can: Learning from Error Corrections and Markings. Proceedings of the 22nd Annual Conference of the European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT 20).After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their respective citations.
