To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InstaHide: Instance-Hiding Schemes for Private Distributed Learning" by Yangsibo Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the InstaHide challenge, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of image classification.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the InstaHide challenge and its relation to various datasets. They reference the MNIST dataset for image classification, which is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning.In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the InstaHide challenge and mention that it involves mixing private images with public images from the **ImageNet dataset**. This indicates that ImageNet is a dataset used in their experiments.I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used for evaluation. The authors state that they use the **InstaHide Challenge dataset**, which is a synthetic dataset created for their experiments.Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:1. For **MNIST**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/2. For **ImageNet**, the citation is: > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR), pages 248a255, 2009. Available: https://github.com/oliviercun/learn-cv9. The **InstaHide Challenge dataset** is a synthetic dataset created for the InstaHide challenge, but it does not have a formal citation since it is not a publicly available dataset in the same way as MNIST or ImageNet. However, I will note that it is a custom dataset for their experiments.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the publicly available datasets while noting the InstaHide Challenge dataset as a custom dataset for their research. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the paper.
