To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A3-108 Machine Translation System for LoResMT Shared Task @MT Summit 2021 Conference" by Saumitra Yadav et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the authors' work on a machine translation system for the LoResMT shared task, which suggests that datasets related to this task may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods** sections, particularly looking for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction mentions the use of data driven methods and statistical models, but it does not specify any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the methods section.In the **methods section**, the authors describe their approach to creating synthetic data and augmenting existing datasets. They mention using parallel and monolingual corpora, but they do not provide specific dataset names. However, they do reference the use of existing monolingual corpora for English and Marathi, which indicates that these corpora are crucial for their experiments.I will also check the **data section** for any explicit mentions of datasets. Here, the authors state that they used the organizers' provided parallel and monolingual corpus for their experiments. They also mention creating a Marathi monolingual corpus by combining existing monolingual corpora for English and Marathi.Now, I will look for the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the following datasets:- For the **monolingual corpus**, the citation is: > Ojha, A. K., Liu, C.-H., Kann, K., Ortega, J., Satam, S., and Fransen, T. (2021). Findings of the LoResMT2021 Shared Task on COVID and Sign Language for Low-Resource Languages. In Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Technologies for MT of Low Resource Languages.- For the **monolingual corpus for English and Marathi**, the citation is: > Patel, R. N., Gupta, R., Pimpale, P. B., and M, S. (2013). Reordering rules for English-Hindi SMT. In Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Hybrid Approaches to Translation, pages 34a41, Soia, Bulgaria.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
