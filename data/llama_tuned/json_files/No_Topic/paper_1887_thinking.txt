To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probe-Less Probing of BERT as Layer-Wise Linguistic Knowledge with Masked Word Prediction" by Tatsuya Aoyama and Nathan Schneider, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experimental setup, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the analysis of BERT's layer-wise masked word prediction on an English corpus, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe the corpus used for their experiments. They mention using the **STREUSLE 4.4 corpus**, which contains 723 documents, 3,813 sentences, and 55,590 tokens. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.In the **results section**, the authors provide additional details about the corpus, confirming its use in their experiments. They also mention the annotation of various syntactic and lexical-semantic information, which further emphasizes the dataset's significance.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the STREUSLE 4.4 corpus. The citation is as follows:> Nathan Schneider, Jena D. Hwang, Vivek Srikumar, Jakob Prange, Austin Blodgett, Sarah R. Moeller, Aviram Stern, Adi Bitan, and Omri Abend. *Comprehensive supersense disambiguation of English prepositions and possessives*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 185a196, Melbourne, Australia, 2018. Association for Computational Linguistics.Since the STREUSLE 4.4 corpus is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
