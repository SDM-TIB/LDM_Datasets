To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BAD: An assistant tool for making verses in Basque" by Manex Agirrezabal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the tool's purpose and its relation to Basque verse-making, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The authors discuss the importance of the Bertsolari tradition and the need for a tool to assist in verse composition, but they do not mention specific datasets at this point.In the **methodology section**, I will look for any detailed descriptions of datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors mention a database of 3,500 Basque verse transcriptions, which is a significant dataset for their work. However, they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset in the text. I will need to check the **references section** to find the full citation for this dataset.The relevant citation for the Basque verse transcriptions is:> Garzia, J., Sarasua, J., & EgaEna, A. (2001). *The art of bertsolaritza: improvised Basque versesinging*. Bertsolari liburuak.Now that I have identified the dataset, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Basque verse transcriptions, ensuring that the citation is included accurately, as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work.
