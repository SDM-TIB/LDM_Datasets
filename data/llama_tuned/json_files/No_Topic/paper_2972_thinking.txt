To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpreting Deep Classification Models with Bayesian Inference" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on two popular deep convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they conducted experiments on the **MNIST dataset** and the **CIFAR10 dataset**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their research.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets:1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for handwritten digit recognition tasks. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each labeled with a digit from 0 to 9.2. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: This dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is widely used for image classification tasks.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/- For the **CIFAR10 Dataset**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.htmlAfter gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
