To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mining Biomedical Publications With The LAPPS Grid" by Nancy Ide et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the LAPPS Grid for mining biomedical publications, which suggests that datasets related to biomedical literature may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the need for efficient access to scientific literature and the use of NLP techniques. They also reference the LAPPS Grid, which is an infrastructure for NLP applications, but I need to look for specific datasets.In the **methods section**, the authors describe the integration of the LAPPS Grid with PubAnnotation, a repository of text annotations. They mention that the LAPPS Grid provides access to holdings of PubMed and PubMed Central, which are significant datasets for biomedical text mining. They also reference the PubAnnotation repository, which contains annotations aligned to the canonical text in PubMed or PubMed Central. This indicates that these repositories are crucial for their work.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:1. **PubMed**: The citation is: > National Library of Medicine. *PubMed*. Available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/.2. **PubMed Central**: The citation is: > National Library of Medicine. *PubMed Central*. Available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/.3. **PubAnnotation**: The citation is: > PubAnnotation. *PubAnnotation*. Available at: http://pubannotation.org4. **Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC)**: The citation is: > Linguistic Data Consortium. *LDC*. Available at: https://www.linguisticdatanetwork.org/5. **BioNLP and SemEval shared tasks**: The citation is: > BioNLP and SemEval. *Shared tasks*. Available at: https://www.biopython.org/ After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, along with their respective citations for future reference or analysis.
