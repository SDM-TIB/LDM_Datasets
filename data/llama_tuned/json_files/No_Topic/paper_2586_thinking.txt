To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Grammatical markers and grammatical relations in the simple clause in Old French" by Nicolas Mazziotta, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the study of grammatical markers in Old French, which suggests that datasets related to Old French may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the author mentions any specific datasets or sources used for analysis. The introduction provides a historical context and mentions three previous accounts, but it does not specify any datasets directly. I will need to look further into the paper.In the **methodology section**, I will look for any datasets that are explicitly listed or described. The paper discusses various theoretical frameworks and references several works, but it does not mention specific datasets. However, it does reference three previous accounts, which may indicate the datasets used in those studies. I will need to check the **references section** to find the full citations for these accounts.In the **references section**, I will look for the citations of the works mentioned in the methodology. The references include:- For the criteria by Igor MelaEcuk, the citation is: > Igor MelaEcuk. *Criteria for finding dependencies*. In Alain PolguA re and Igor MelaEcuk, editors, Dependency in linguistic description, pages 1a110. John Benjamins, Amsterdam and Philadelphia, 2009.- For Thomas GroAas' intra-word analysis, the citation is: > Thomas GroAas. *Catenae in morphology*. In Kim Gerdes, Elena HajiEcovA, and Leo Wanner, editors, Proceedings of Depling 2011, International Conference on Dependency Linguistics, Barcelona, pages 47a57, 2011.- For Alain LemarAchal's work, the citation is: > Alain LemarAchal. *ZAro(s)_. Presses universitaires de France, Paris, 1997.After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their corresponding citations.
