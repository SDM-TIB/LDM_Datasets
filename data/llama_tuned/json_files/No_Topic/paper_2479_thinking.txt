To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating GAN-Based Image Augmentation for Threat Detection in Large-Scale X-ray Security Images" by Joanna Kazzandra Dumagpi and Yong-Jin Jeong, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a large-scale X-ray security image dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of imbalanced data in X-ray security images. They mention the need for a large-scale dataset, which leads me to look for specific dataset names.In the **introduction**, the authors reference the **SIXray dataset** as the largest publicly available database for X-ray security images. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.I will then check the **methods section** to confirm the details of the dataset used. The authors describe the SIXray dataset in detail, stating that it consists of images collected in real-world security system setups, specifically in subway stations. They mention that the dataset is imbalanced, with a significant number of negative samples compared to positive samples, which is crucial for their experiments.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the SIXray dataset. The citation is as follows:> Miao, C., Xie, L., Wan, F., Su, C., Liu, H., Jiao, J., & Ye, Q. (2019). *SIXray: A Large-scale Security Inspection X-ray Benchmark for Prohibited Item Discovery in Overlapping Images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Long Beach, CA, USA, 15a20 June 2019.Since the paper primarily focuses on the SIXray dataset, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the SIXray dataset, ensuring that it includes all relevant details and the full citation, ready for further processing or review.
