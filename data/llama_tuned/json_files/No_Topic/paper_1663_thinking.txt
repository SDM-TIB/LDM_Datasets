To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MoRTy: Unsupervised Learning of Task-specialized Word Embeddings by Autoencoding" by Nils Rethmeier and Barbara Plank, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on 18 publicly available benchmark tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. They mention using two word embedding methods (Fasttext and GloVe) and two corpus sizes (2M and 103M WikiText). This suggests that the datasets are related to word embeddings and corpus sizes.In the **experiments section**, the authors specify that they evaluate their method on 18 semantic benchmark tasks developed by Jastrzebski et al. (2017). This indicates that the datasets are part of a benchmarking framework.I will also check the **related work section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned. However, the primary focus is on the datasets used for evaluation.Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the following datasets:- For the **WikiText datasets**, the citation is: > Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, and Richard Socher. *Deep contextualized word representations*. CoRR, abs/1609.07843, 2016.- For the **benchmark tasks**, the citation is: > Stanislaw Jastrzebski, Damian Lesniak, and Wojciech Marian Czarnecki. *How to evaluate the importance of data in word embeddings?*. CoRR, abs/1702.02170, 2017.With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
