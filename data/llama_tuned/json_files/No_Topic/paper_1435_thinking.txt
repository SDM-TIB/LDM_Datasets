To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Neural Verb Lexicon Model with Source-side Syntactic Context for String-to-Tree Machine Translation" by Maria Neadejde et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of verb translation in machine translation and hints at the use of parallel data, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the use of "all available data from WMT15" for training their model, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their experiments. In the **experiments section**, they specify that the evaluation test set consists of **newstest2013, newstest2014, and newstest2015**, totaling 8,172 sentences. This is a clear indication of the datasets used for evaluation.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the WMT15 dataset. The relevant citation is:- For **WMT15**, the citation is: > O. Bojar, R. Chatterjee, C. Federmann, B. Haddow, M. Huck, C. Hokamp, P. Koehn, V. Logacheva, C. Monz, M. Negri, M. Post, C. Scarton, L. Specia, and M. Turchi. *Findings of the 2015 workshop on statistical machine translation*. In Proceedings of the Tenth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, Lisbon, Portugal, September 2015, pp. 1a46.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes the dataset names and their respective citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper.
