To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantifying the impact of files treated as single textual units when they are really collections" by Thibault ClA erice, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a large corpus of Latin works, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the author mentions a "large 20M tokens corpus of Latin works." This indicates that the dataset is significant and likely used for analysis.In the **methodology section**, the author describes the **Corpus Latin antiquitA e et antiquitA e tardive lemmatisA e**, which aggregates original works from various sources, including Perseus, Open Greek and Latin, Lasciva Roma, and DigilibLT. This section provides detailed information about the dataset, including its size and composition.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Corpus Latin antiquitA e et antiquitA e tardive lemmatisA e**. The citation is:> Thibault ClA erice. *Corpus Latin antiquitA e et antiquitA e tardive lemmatisA e*. 2020.Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:1. **Corpus Latin antiquitA e et antiquitA e tardive lemmatisA e**: A large corpus of Latin works that aggregates original works from various sources, including Perseus, Open Greek and Latin, Lasciva Roma, and DigilibLT.2. **Martialas Epigrammata**: A collection of over 1,527 poems from Martial's works, used in the analysis of segmentation effects.3. **Priapea**: An anonymous work included in the corpus, contributing to the analysis of segmentation effects.Next, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
