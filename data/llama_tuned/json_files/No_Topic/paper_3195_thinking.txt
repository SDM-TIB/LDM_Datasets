To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Entropy Loss Leads to Poor Margins" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the implications of cross-entropy loss on neural networks, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **introduction** where the authors may provide context or references to datasets used in their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (if present) or any **results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their experiments, specifically for training a neural network to classify images. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The citation is as follows:- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset.After completing this process, I will prepare the dataset entry for the CIFAR-10 dataset, ensuring that it includes all necessary details such as the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
