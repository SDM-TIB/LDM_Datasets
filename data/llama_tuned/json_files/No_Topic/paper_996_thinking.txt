To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SwatCS: Combining simple classifiers with estimated accuracy" by Sam Clark and Richard Wicentowski, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the SwatCS system, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **data sections** for more detailed information.In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research and the challenges of sentiment analysis on Twitter data, but they do not specify any datasets at this point. I will continue to the **data section** to find any explicit mentions of datasets.Next, I will examine the **data section** closely. Here, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two primary datasets:1. **Training Data**: The authors refer to a manually-labeled set of approximately 15,000 tweets, which is crucial for their sentiment analysis task. This dataset is essential for training their classifiers.2. **External Data**: The authors also mention an external dataset built by Go et al. (2009) that contains 50,000 tweets, which they used for their unconstrained submission. This dataset is used to improve the performance of their system.Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Training Data**, the citation is: > Wilson, T., Kozareva, Z., Nakov, P., Rosenthal, S., Stoyanov, V., & Ritter, A. (2013). *Sentiment analysis with deep learning*. In Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 1-10.- For the **External Data**, the citation is: > Go, A., Bhayani, R., & Huang, L. (2009). *Twitter sentiment classification using distant supervision*. Technical report, Stanford University.After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
