To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Self-Training through Spaced Repetition" by Hadi Amiri, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on publicly available datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention two datasets:1. **IMDb Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification, containing 50,000 labeled movie reviews. The authors describe how they randomly sampled 1K, 1K, and 48K instances from this dataset for their experiments.2. **Churn Dataset**: This dataset is used for churn prediction, containing more than 5K tweets about three telecommunication brands. The authors also mention that they created additional datasets by replacing target brand names and adding 100K unlabeled tweets.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **IMDb Dataset**, the citation is: > Andrew Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies-volume 1, pages 142a150. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2011.- For the **Churn Dataset**, the citation is: > Hadi Amiri and Hal DaumA e III. *Target-dependent churn classification in microblogs*. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pages 2361a2367. AAAI Press, 2015.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
