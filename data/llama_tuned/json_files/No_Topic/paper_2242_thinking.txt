To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Issue-oriented Syllabus Retrieval System based on Terminology-based Syllabus Structuring and Visualization" by Hideki Mima, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the development of an issue-oriented syllabus retrieval system, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the evaluation or testing of the system.Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the author describes the practical applications of the system. Here, the author mentions that the system has been tested on the **University of Tokyo's Open Course Ware (UT-OCW)** and the **Syllabus-Structuring (SS) site** for the School/Department of Engineering. This indicates that these are the datasets used for evaluation.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:- For **University of Tokyo's Open Course Ware (UT-OCW)**, the citation is: > University of Tokyo. *Open Course Ware*. Available at: http://ocw.u-tokyo.ac.jp/.- For **Syllabus-Structuring (SS) site**, the citation is: > University of Tokyo. *Syllabus-Structuring (SS) site*. Available at: http://ciee.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources from the paper.
