To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Causal Investigation of Public Opinion during the COVID-19 Pandemic via Social Media Text" by Michael Jantscher and Roman Kern, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyze sentiment analysis of Tweets toward the COVID-19 situation in the UK and Sweden, which suggests that datasets related to social media data are involved.Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, where the authors describe their data collection process. They mention using a geotagged Twitter dataset from the **Proceedings of the 13th Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2022)**, which is a significant dataset for their analysis.In the **dataset section**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets used:1. **Geotagged Twitter Dataset**: This dataset includes Tweets related to COVID-19, specifically from the UK and Sweden, and is used for sentiment analysis and causal mediation analysis. The authors reference the dataset as being licensed under CC-BY-NC-4.0.2. **COVID-19 Data Repository**: This dataset provides epidemiological reported COVID-19 cases and deaths from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). The authors focus on weekly cases and deaths for their analysis.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Geotagged Twitter Dataset**, the citation is: > Proceedings of the 13th Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2022), pages 211a226, Marseille, 20-25 June 2022.- For the **COVID-19 Data Repository**, the citation is: > Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). *COVID-19 Data Repository*. Available at: https://coronavirus. Johns Hopkins University, 2020.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
