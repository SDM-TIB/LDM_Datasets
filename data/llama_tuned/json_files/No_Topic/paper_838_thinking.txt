To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Number agreement, dependency length, and word order in Finnish traditional dialects" by Kaius SinnemÃ¤ki and Akira Takaki, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyzed data from The Finnish Dialect Syntax Archive, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their research.Next, I will focus on the **data and methods section**. Here, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they used, specifically mentioning that it contains **recorded spoken data from more than 100 interviewees, totaling roughly one million lemmas**. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context about its collection and characteristics.In the **data and methods section**, the authors describe the dataset as being collected between the 1950s and 1970s, containing narratives from uneducated rural residents. They also mention that the data is grammatically annotated, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as being from The Finnish Dialect Syntax Archive, which is a well-known resource in linguistics. The citation for this dataset is:- For **The Finnish Dialect Syntax Archive**, the citation is: > Osmo Ikola, editor. *Lauseopin arkiston opas, volume 1 of Lauseopin arkiston julkaisuja*. Turun yliopisto, Turku, 1985.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in future work.
