To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tag Taxonomy Aware Dictionary Learning for Region Tagging" by Jingjing Zheng and Zhuolin Jiang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three datasets:1. **MSRC-v1**: This dataset contains 240 images segmented into 562 regions associated with 13 tags.2. **MSRC-v2**: This dataset has 591 images and 1482 regions associated with 23 tags.3. **SAIAPR TC-12**: This dataset includes 99,535 regions segmented from 20,000 images, with 276 tags organized in a hierarchical structure.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **MSRC-v1**, the citation is: > J. Shotton, J. M. Winn, C. Rother, and A. Criminisi. *Textureboost for image understanding: Multi-class object recognition and segmentation by jointly modeling texture, layout, and context*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2009.- For **MSRC-v2**, the citation is: > J. Shotton, J. M. Winn, C. Rother, and A. Criminisi. *Textureboost for image understanding: Multi-class object recognition and segmentation by jointly modeling texture, layout, and context*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2009.- For **SAIAPR TC-12**, the citation is: > H. J. Escalante, C. A. Hernández, J. A. González, A. López-López, M. M. y Gómez, E. F. Morales, L. E. Sucar, L. V. Pineda, and M. Grubinger. *The segmented and annotated IAPR TC-12 benchmark*. Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 2010.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their respective citations.
