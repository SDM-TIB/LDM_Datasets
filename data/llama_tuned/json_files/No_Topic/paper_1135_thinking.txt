To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using a large n-gram corpus for grammar checking" by Rogelio Nazar and Irene Renau, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize a large n-gram corpus for grammar checking, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the use of a large n-gram corpus, specifically mentioning the **Google Books N-gram Corpus**. This is a clear indication that this corpus is the primary dataset used in their research.I will then examine the **methodology section** to confirm the details of the dataset. The authors describe the Google Books N-gram Corpus as a database of n-grams of sequences of up to 5 words, which records the frequency distribution of each unit in each year from 1500 onwards. This detailed description reinforces the importance of this dataset in their experiments.Now, I will look for the **references section** to find the full citation for the Google Books N-gram Corpus. The citation is as follows:> Jean-Baptiste Michel, Yuan Kui Shen, Aviva Presser, Adrian Veres, Matthew K. Gray, The Google Books Team, Joseph P. Pickett, Dale Hoiberg, Dan Clancy, Peter Norvig, Jon Orwant, Steven Pinker, Martin A. Nowak, Erez Lieberman. *Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books*. Science, 331(6014):176a182, 2011.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the **Google Books N-gram Corpus** is the only dataset used in this research.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
