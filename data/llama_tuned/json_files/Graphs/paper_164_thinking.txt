To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Molecular Graph Neural Networks for Predicting Molecule Properties" by Zeren Shui and George Karypis, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on the **QM9 dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the limitations of existing methods and mention the **QM9 dataset** as a benchmark for evaluating their model. This confirms its importance.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the **QM9 dataset**, which consists of around 130,000 equilibrium molecules associated with various properties. They also mention that they randomly selected 110,000 molecules for training, 10,000 for validation, and 10831 for testing, further emphasizing the dataset's significance.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **QM9 dataset**. The citation is as follows:> L. Ruddigkeit, R. Van Deursen, L. C. Blum, and J.-L. Reymond. *Enumeration of 166 billion organic small molecules in the chemical universe database gdb-17*. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 52(11):2864a2875, 2012.Since the **QM9 dataset** is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details.
