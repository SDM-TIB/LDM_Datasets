To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Learning on Attributed Graphs via Graph Cognizant Logistic Regression and Preemptive Query Generation" by Florence Regola et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on five public benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using five public benchmark datasets: **Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, Am-comp, and Am-photo**. I will note down the details provided about each dataset, including the number of classes, features, nodes, edges, and edge density.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.The datasets mentioned are:1. **Cora**: This dataset is used for node classification in attributed graphs, containing 7,308 nodes, 2,708 features, 5,403 edges, and an edge density of 0.04%.2. **Citeseer**: Similar to Cora, this dataset is used for node classification, consisting of 6,169 nodes, 3,135 features, 4,432 edges, and an edge density of 0.04%.3. **Pubmed**: This dataset is also for node classification, containing 19,717 nodes, 3,703 features, 5,500 edges, and an edge density of 0.01%.4. **Am-comp**: This dataset is used for node classification, consisting of 2,110 nodes, 2,525 features, 3,381 edges, and an edge density of 0.11%.5. **Am-photo**: This dataset is used for node classification, containing 5,753 nodes, 3,668 features, 4,324 edges, and an edge density of 5.54%.6. **Microwave Link Network Dataset**: This is a private dataset collected for the task of identifying faulty links in a microwave link network.Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset based on the references provided in the paper. The citations are as follows:- For **Cora**, the citation is: > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., and Eliassi-Rad, T. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93, Sep 2008.- For **Citeseer**, the citation is: > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., and Eliassi-Rad, T. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93, Sep 2008.- For **Pubmed**, the citation is: > Namata, G., London, B., Getoor, L., and Huang, B. *Query-driven active surveying for collective classification*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Mining and Learning with Graphs, International Conference on Machine Learning, 2012.- For **Am-comp**, the citation is: > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., and G¨unnemann, S. *Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation*. In Relational Representation Learning Workshop, NeurIPS 2018.- For **Am-photo**, the citation is: > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., and G¨unnemann, S. *Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation*. In Relational Representation Learning Workshop, NeurIPS 2018.- For the **Microwave Link Network Dataset**, the citation is: > Regola, F., Pal, S., Zhang, Y., Coates, M. *Active Learning on Attributed Graphs via Graph Cognizant Logistic Regression and Preemptive Query Generation*. In Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Machine Learning, Vienna, Austria, PMLR 119, 2020.After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
