To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Distance Metric Learning with GRAPH-BERT" by Jiawei Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of a new graph neural network for distance metric learning, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three benchmark graph datasets:1. **AIDS Dataset**: This dataset is used for graph similarity search tasks. The authors reference the original work by Zeng et al. (2009) for its application in graph edit distance computation.2. **LINUX Dataset**: Another dataset used for graph similarity search, referenced in the context of graph edit distance computation. The authors cite Wang et al. (2012) for this dataset.3. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset is also used for graph similarity search and is referenced in the context of graph edit distance computation. The authors cite Yanardag and Vishwanathan (2015) for this dataset.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:- For the **AIDS Dataset**, the citation is: > Zeng, Z., Tung, A. K. H., Wang, J., Feng, J., and Zhou, L. *Comparing stars: On approximating graph edit distance*. Proceedings of the 2009 VLDB Endow., 2(1):25?36, August 2009. doi: 10.14778/1687627.1687631.- For the **LINUX Dataset**, the citation is: > Wang, X., Ding, X., Tung, A., Ying, S., and Jin, H. *An efficient graph indexing method*. Proceedings of the 2012 International Conference on Data Engineering, 2012. doi: 10.1109/ICDE.2012.28.- For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is: > Yanardag, P., and Vishwanathan, S. *Deep graph kernels*. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD?15, pp. 1365?1374, New York, NY, USA, 2015. doi: 10.1145/2783417.2783258.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
