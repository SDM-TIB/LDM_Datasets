To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text Level Graph Neural Network for Text Classification" by Lianzhe Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several text classification datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. They list three datasets: **R8, R52, and Ohsumed**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the datasets as follows:1. **R8**: A subset of the Reuters 21578 dataset, used for text classification.2. **R52**: Another subset of the Reuters 21578 dataset, also used for text classification.3. **Ohsumed**: A corpus extracted from the MEDLINE database, used for multi-label classification.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **R8** and **R52**, the citation is: > Joost Bastings, Ivan Titov, Wilker Aziz, Diego Marcheggiani, and Khalil Simaan. *Graph convolutional encoders for syntax-aware neural machine translation*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1957a1967, 2017.- For **Ohsumed**, the citation is: > Armand Joulin, Edouard Grave, Piotr Bojanowski, and Tomas Mikolov. *Bag of tricks for efficient text classification*. In Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Volume 2, Short Papers, pages 427a431, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
