To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SeCo: Exploring Sequence Supervision for Unsupervised Representation Learning" by Ting Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of unsupervised learning methods and mentions several datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:1. **Kinetics400**: This dataset is described as a large-scale action recognition benchmark containing around 300K videos from 400 action categories. It is split into training, validation, and testing sets.2. **UCF101**: This dataset consists of 13,320 videos from 101 action classes, with a split into training and testing sets.3. **HMDB51**: This dataset includes 7K videos from 51 action categories, also divided into training and testing sets.4. **ActivityNet**: This dataset is a large-scale human activity understanding benchmark, containing 19,994 videos from 200 activity categories, with a specific split for training, validation, and testing.5. **GOT-10K**: This dataset is used for object tracking and contains over 10K real-world videos with manually labeled bounding boxes, covering various categories of moving objects and motion patterns.6. **OTB-100**: This dataset is utilized for object tracking and consists of 100 video sequences for evaluation.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For **Kinetics400**, the citation is: > Kay, W., Carreira, J., Simonyan, K., Zhang, B., Hillier, C., Vijayanarasimhan, S., Viola, F., Green, T., Back, T., Natsev, P., Suleyman, M., & Zisserman, A. (2017). The arXiv preprint Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950*.- For **UCF101**, the citation is: > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A Dataset of 101 Human Actions Classes From Videos in The Wild*. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402*.- For **HMDB51**, the citation is: > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Garrote, E., Poggio, T., & Serre, T. (2011). *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In *Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)*.- For **ActivityNet**, the citation is: > Heilbron, F. C., Escorcia, V., Ghanem, B., & Niebles, J. C. (2015). *ActivityNet: A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding*. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*.- For **GOT-10K**, the citation is: > Huang, L., Zhao, X., & Huang, K. (2019). *GOT-10k: A Large High-Diversity Benchmark for Generic Object Tracking in the Wild*. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 41(1), 1-15.- For **OTB-100**, the citation is: > Wu, Y., Lim, J., & Yang, M.-H. (2015). *Object Tracking Benchmark*. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 37(1), 1-15.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their corresponding references from the paper.
