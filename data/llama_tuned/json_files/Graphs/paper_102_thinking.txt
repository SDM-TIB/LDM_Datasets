To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Graph Transformer for Free-Hand Sketch Recognition" by Peng Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive numerical experiments on a sketch recognition task, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they state that they applied their method on **414k sketches from Google QuickDraw**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.I will also check the **methodology section** to confirm the details of the dataset. The authors describe the dataset as being collected from an international online game where users sketch objects from 345 classes, which further confirms the dataset's relevance.Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Google QuickDraw dataset. The citation is as follows:> D. Ha and D. Eck, "A neural representation of sketch drawings," arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.03477, 2017.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Google QuickDraw dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Google QuickDraw dataset, ensuring that it is ready for any further processing or review.
