To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Biological Knowledge with Factor Graph Neural Network for Interpretable Deep Learning" by Tianle Ma and Aidong Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their model to two cancer genomic datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4.1), where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:1. **TCGA-LUSC (Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma)**: This dataset contains gene expression profiles for lung cancer samples, specifically focusing on primary solid tumor samples from two different tumor stages. The authors provide details about the number of samples and the stages included.2. **TCGA-KIRC (Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma)**: This dataset includes gene expression profiles for kidney cancer samples, specifically for primary solid tumor samples across three different stages. The authors also mention the total number of samples for each stage.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **TCGA-LUSC**, the citation is: > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) - Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC) dataset*. 2019. Available at: https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/.- For **TCGA-KIRC**, the citation is: > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) - Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) dataset*. 2019. Available at: https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
