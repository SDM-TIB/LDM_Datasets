To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VGCN-BERT: Augmenting BERT with Graph Embedding for Text Classification" by Zhibin Lu, Pan Du, and Jian-Yun Nie, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several text classification datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention five datasets for their experiments:1. **SST-2**: This dataset is a binary single-sentence classification task consisting of movie reviews with sentiment annotations. The authors specify that it contains 6,920 examples in the training set, 872 in the validation set, and 1,821 in the test set, totaling 4,963 positive reviews and 4,650 negative reviews.2. **MR**: This dataset is also a movie review dataset for binary sentiment classification, containing 5,331 positive and 5,331 negative reviews, with an average length of 21.0 words.3. **CoLA**: The Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability is a binary single-sentence classification task for grammatical acceptability, containing 8,551 training data and 1,043 test data, totaling 6,744 positive and 2,850 negative cases.4. **ArangoHate**: This dataset is a resampled dataset merging datasets from previous works, containing 2,920 hateful documents and 4,086 normal documents, with an average length of 13.3 words.5. **FountaHate**: This dataset is a large four-label dataset for hate speech and offensive language detection, containing 99,996 tweets with cross-validated labels, classified into four labels: normal, spam, hateful, and abusive.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For **SST-2**, the citation is: > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A., & Potts, C. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing (EMNLP), 2013.- For **MR**, the citation is: > Tang, J., Qu, M., & Mei, Q. *PTE: Predictive text embedding through large-scale heterogeneous text networks*. In Proceedings of the 2015 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), 2015.- For **CoLA**, the citation is: > Warstadt, A., Singh, A., & Bowman, S. R. *Neural network acceptability judgments*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.12471, 2018.- For **ArangoHate**, the citation is: > Arango, A., Perez, J., & Poblete, B. *Hate Speech Detection is Not as Easy as You May Think: A Closer Look at Model Validation*. In Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM), 2019.- For **FountaHate**, the citation is: > Founta, A. M., Djouvas, C., Chatzakou, D., Leontiadis, I., Blackburn, J., Stringhini, G., Vakali, A., Sirivianos, M., & Kourtellis, N. *Large scale crowdsourcing and characterization of Twitter abusive behavior*. In Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM), 2018.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
