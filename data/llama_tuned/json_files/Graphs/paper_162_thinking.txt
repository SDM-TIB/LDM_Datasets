To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the equivalence of molecular graph convolution and molecular wave function with poor basis set" by Masashi Tsubaki and Teruyasu Mizoguchi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the **QM9 dataset** for energy prediction tasks, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the **QM9 dataset** again, confirming its significance in their experiments. They describe it as containing approximately 130,000 molecules with various quantum chemical properties, which is a key detail for understanding its application in their work.In the **methods section**, the authors provide more context about the **QM9 dataset**, stating that they created a subset of this dataset, referred to as **QM9under14atoms**, which includes 15,000 molecules with a limited number of atoms (14). This subset is specifically used for their experiments.I will also check the **results section** to confirm the datasets used for evaluation, which reiterates the importance of the **QM9under14atoms dataset** for their energy prediction tasks.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the **QM9 dataset**. The citation is as follows:> Raghunathan Ramakrishnan, Pavlo O Dral, Matthias Rupp, and O Anatole Von Lilienfeld. *Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules*. Scientific Data, 1:140022, 2014.Since the **QM9under14atoms dataset** is a subset of the **QM9 dataset**, I will include the citation for the original **QM9 dataset** as well.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for both datasets in the output. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
