To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction with Structure-Based Deep Fusion Inference" by Derek Jones et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **PDBBind 2016 dataset**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the **PDBBind 2016 dataset** as the dataset used for their experiments. They describe it as a curated subset of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and provide details about its structure and content, including the number of protein-ligand binding complexes it contains.In the **results section**, the authors confirm that they used the **PDBBind 2016 dataset** for their evaluations, which reinforces its importance in their research. They also mention that they used the **PDBBind 2016 core set** for specific analyses, which is a subset of the larger dataset.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **PDBBind 2016 dataset**. The citation is as follows:> wwPDB consortium. *Protein Data Bank: The single global archive for 3D macromolecular structure data*. Nucleic Acids Research, 47(D1), D520aD528, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky774With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry for **PDBBind 2016**. The dataset details include:1. **PDBBind 2016 Dataset**: A curated subset of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) containing 13,308 protein-ligand binding complexes, with specific subsets for general, refined, and core sets.Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
