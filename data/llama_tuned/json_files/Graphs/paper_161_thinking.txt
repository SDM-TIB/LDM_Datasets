To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EDGNN: A Simple and Powerful GNN for Directed Labeled Graphs" by Guillaume Jaume et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the **edGNN model on various graph classification tasks, but it does not specify the datasets.** I will need to look deeper into the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the **datasets and baseline lines subsection**. Here, the authors mention two datasets used for their experiments:1. **MUTAG Dataset**: This dataset is used for graph classification tasks, specifically for predicting mutagenicity. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of graphs, classes, average nodes per graph, and average edges per graph.2. **AIFB Dataset**: This dataset is also used for graph classification tasks, focusing on predicting toxicity. The authors provide similar statistics as for the MUTAG dataset.In the **appendix**, the authors provide detailed statistics for both datasets, confirming their usage in the experiments. Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **MUTAG Dataset**, the citation is: > Petar Ristoski and Heiko Paulheim. *A collection of benchmark datasets for systematic evaluations of machine learning on the semantic web*. In Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2016.- For the **AIFB Dataset**, the citation is: > Petar Ristoski, Gerben Klaas Dirk De Vries, and Heiko Paulheim. *A collection of benchmark datasets for systematic evaluations of machine learning on the semantic web*. In Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2016.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
