To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Personalized Graph Neural Networks with Attention Mechanism for Session-Aware Recommendation" by Mengqi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention two datasets:1. **Xing Dataset**: This dataset contains interactions on job postings for 770,000 users over an 80-day period, including user behaviors such as clicks, bookmarks, replies, and deletions. The authors describe the preprocessing steps taken to prepare the data for modeling.2. **Reddit Dataset**: This dataset consists of tuples of user names, subreddits, and timestamps for interactions. The authors explain how they split the data into training and test sets and describe the preprocessing steps to prepare the data for modeling.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For the **Xing Dataset**, the citation is: > M. Quadrana, A. Karatzoglou, B. Hidasi, and P. Cremonesi. *Personalizing session-based recommendations with hierarchical recurrent neural networks*. In Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, 2017.- For the **Reddit Dataset**, the citation is: > M. Ruocco, O. S. L. Skrede, and H. Langseth. *Inter-session modeling for session-based recommendation*. In Proceedings of the 2017 ACM Conference on Recommender Systems.Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
