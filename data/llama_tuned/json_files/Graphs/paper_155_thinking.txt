To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TransGCN: Coupling Transformation Assumptions with Graph Convolutional Networks for Link Prediction" by Ling Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets, which suggests that specific names will be provided later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention two datasets: **FB15K-237** and **WN18RR**. I will extract details about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide the following information about the datasets:1. **FB15K-237**: This dataset is derived from Freebase and contains 14,541 entities, 237,272 relations, and 17,535 training triples, 20,466 validation triples, and 3,034 test triples.2. **WN18RR**: This dataset is derived from WordNet and consists of 40,943 entities, 1,186 relations, and 3,034 training triples, 3,134 validation triples, and 3,134 test triples.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **FB15K-237**, the citation is: > Kristina Toutanova and Danqi Chen. *Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text inference*. In Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Continuous Vector Space Models and their Compositionality, pages 57a66, 2015.- For **WN18RR**, the citation is: > Tim Dettmers, Minervini Pasquale, Stenetorp Pontus, and Sebastian Riedel. *Convolutional 2D Knowledge Graph Embeddings*. In Proceedings of the 32th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pages 1811a1818, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their characteristics and citations.
