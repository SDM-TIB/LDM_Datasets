To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CayleyNets: Graph Convolutional Neural Networks with Complex Rational Spectral Filters" by Ron Levie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of a new spectral domain convolutional architecture, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for specific dataset names and details about their usage in the experiments.In section 4.1, the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** for digit classification, which is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. They also refer to the **CORA citation graph** for vertex classification, which is another dataset commonly used in graph neural networks.In section 4.4, the authors describe their experiments on the **MovieLens dataset** for a matrix completion task. This dataset is also widely recognized in the field of recommendation systems.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:1. For **MNIST**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/2. For **CORA**, the citation is: > P. Sen, G. Namata, M. Bilgic, L. Getoor, B. Galligher, and T. Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93, 2008. Available: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~mohsen/papers/cora.pdf3. For **MovieLens**, the citation is: > B. N. Miller et al. *MovieLens unplugged: experiences with an occasionally connected recommender system*. In Proc. Intelligent User Interfaces, 2003. Available: http://mml.ist.uci.edu/research/movielens.htmlAfter gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
