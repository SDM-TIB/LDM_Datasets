To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks on Link Prediction" by Xing Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors benchmark several GNN models on different datasets for link prediction, which suggests that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **datasets section** (Section 2) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:1. **Cora**: This dataset is a citation network with 2708 nodes, 5429 links, and 7 classes. It is a standard benchmark for link prediction tasks.2. **CiteSeer**: Similar to Cora, this dataset contains 3327 nodes, 4732 edges, and 6 classes. It is also used for link prediction tasks.3. **PubMed**: This dataset consists of 19717 nodes, 44338 edges, and 3 classes, focusing on scientific publications related to diabetes.4. **WikiCS**: This dataset is based on Wikipedia articles, featuring 11701 nodes, 216213 edges, and 10 classes, making it a unique dataset for link prediction tasks.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **Cora**, the citation is: > Lise Gattoor. *Datasets*. https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/data.- For **CiteSeer**, the citation is the same as Cora since it is derived from the same source: > Lise Gattoor. *Datasets*. https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/data.- For **PubMed**, the citation is also the same as Cora: > Lise Gattoor. *Datasets*. https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/data.- For **WikiCS**, the citation is: > P. Mernyei and C. Cangea. *WikiCS: A Wikipedia-based benchmark for graph neural networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.02901, 2020.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
