To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Risk Management via Anomaly Circumvent: Mnemonic Deep Learning for Midterm Stock Prediction" by Xinyi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **S&P 500 stocks**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide more context about the dataset. They mention that the data for their project are the historical **S&P 500 component stocks**, which is a strong indication that this is the primary dataset used in their analysis.In the **methods section**, the authors describe the data preprocessing steps, stating that they used the historical S&P 500 component stocks from **Yahoo Finance**. This confirms that the S&P 500 dataset is central to their experiments.Now, I will check the **results section** to see if they provide any additional details about the dataset, such as the time period or specific characteristics of the data. The authors mention that the dataset includes 451 stocks, each recording close prices and trading volumes over 2,800 trading days, which further confirms the dataset's scope.In the **references section**, I will look for the full citation related to the S&P 500 dataset. The authors reference the S&P 500 as a market index, but they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself. However, I can cite the S&P 500 index as follows:- For the **S&P 500 dataset**, the citation is: > S&P Dow Jones Indices. *S&P 500 Index*. Available at: https://www.spglobal.com/our-thinking/s&P-500-index/.Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset citation, I will note that the dataset is derived from Yahoo Finance, which is a common source for financial data.Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation for the S&P 500 index as the primary dataset used in the research. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset utilized in the study.
