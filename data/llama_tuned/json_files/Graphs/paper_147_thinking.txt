To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language-mediated, Object-Centric Representation Learning" by Ruocheng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled "Image Segmentation." Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for evaluation:1. **Shop-VRB-Simple**: This dataset is based on the original **Shop-VRB** dataset, which contains images of complex household objects paired with question-answer pairs. The authors describe how they generated additional images to improve the dataset's quality.2. **PartNet-Chairs**: This dataset is derived from **PartNet**, which includes images of furniture with hierarchical structures, along with descriptive sentences that describe the objects. The authors detail how they created a new dataset, PartNet-Chairs, by randomly assigning colors to chair parts and generating descriptive sentences for each image.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **Shop-VRB**, the citation is: > M. Nazarczuk and K. Mikolajczyk. *Shop-vrb: A visual reasoning benchmark for object perception*. In ICRA, 2020.- For **PartNet**, the citation is: > K. Mo et al. *Partnet: A large-scale benchmark for fine-grained and hierarchical part-level 3D object understanding*. In CVPR, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
