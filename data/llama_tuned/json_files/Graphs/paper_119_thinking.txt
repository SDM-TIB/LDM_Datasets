To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Active Surface Models" by Udaranga Wickramasinghe and Pascal Fua, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of Deep Active Surface Models (DASM) and mentions the use of datasets for evaluation, which indicates that datasets are present.Next, I will focus on the **method section**, where the authors describe their approach and may provide specific datasets used for training and testing. In this section, they mention using **ShapeNet** for 3D surface reconstruction and **CortexEM** for 3D surface extraction from electron microscopy image stacks. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial to the experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They specify that they use **ShapeNetCore.v1** for training and testing, which is a well-known dataset in the field of 3D modeling. They also mention the **CortexEM dataset**, which is used for segmenting 3D surfaces from electron microscopy image stacks.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:1. For **ShapeNet**, the citation is: > A. Chang, T. Funkhouser, L. G., P. Hanrahan, Q. Huang, Z. Li, S. Savarese, M. Savva, S. Song, H. Su, J. Xiao, L. Yi, and F. Yu. *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. In arXiv Preprint, 2015.2. For **CortexEM**, the citation is: > A. Jorstad, B. Nigro, C. Cali, M. Wawrzyniak, P. Fua, and G.W. Knott. *Neuromorph: A Toolset for the Morphometric Analysis and Visualization of 3D Models Derived from Electron Microscopy Image Stacks*. Neuroinformatics, 13(1):83a92, 2014.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
