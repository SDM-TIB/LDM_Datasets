To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Directional Message Passing for Molecular Graphs" by Johannes Gasteiger, Janek Groß, and Stephan Gänßmann, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of graph neural networks for predicting molecular properties, which suggests that datasets related to molecular properties might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention two specific datasets:1. **QM9**: This dataset consists of approximately 130,000 molecules in equilibrium and is commonly used for benchmarking quantum chemistry models.2. **MD17**: This dataset contains 50,000 training samples and 10,000 validation and test samples, focusing on predicting molecular dynamics properties for eight small organic molecules.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For **QM9**, the citation is: > Raghunathan Ramakrishnan, Pavlo O. Dral, Matthias Rupp, and O. Anatole von Lilienfeld. *Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules*. Scientific Data, 1(1):1a7, August 2014.- For **MD17**, the citation is: > Stefan Chmiela, Huziel E. Sauceda, Klaus-Robert Müller, and Alexandre Tkatchenko. *Machine learning of accurate energy-conserving molecular force fields*. Science Advances, 3(5):e1603015, May 2017.Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
