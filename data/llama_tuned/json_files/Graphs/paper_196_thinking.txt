To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Temporal Learning" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses self-supervised learning for video representations, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, particularly in the context of action recognition tasks.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three datasets:1. **Kinetics-400**: This dataset is described as a large-scale action dataset containing about 300,000 videos across 400 classes. The authors specify that they use the training split without annotations for pre-training.2. **UCF101**: This dataset consists of 13,000 videos spanning 101 human action classes. The authors note that they use the first split for both pre-training and evaluation.3. **HMDB51**: This dataset contains approximately 7,000 videos across 51 classes, and the authors also use the first split for downstream tasks.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For **Kinetics-400**, the citation is: > Joao Carreira and Andrew Zisserman. *Quo vadis, action recognition? A new model and the kinetics dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 6299a6308, 2017.- For **UCF101**, the citation is: > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human action classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.- For **HMDB51**, the citation is: > Hildegard Kuehne, Hueihan Jhuang, EstA Abaliz Garrote, Tomaso Poggio, and Thomas Serre. *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In 2011 International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 2556a2563, 2011.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
