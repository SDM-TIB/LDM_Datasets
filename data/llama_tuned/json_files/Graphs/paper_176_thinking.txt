To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge Association with Hyperbolic Knowledge Graph Embeddings" by Zequn Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of knowledge graphs for various NLP applications, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a subsection that details the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets for their experiments:1. **DBP15K**: This dataset is used for entity alignment tasks. It is derived from DBpedia and consists of three settings (ZH-EN, JA-EN, and FR-En). The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of objects, relations, triples, and associations.2. **YAGO26K-906 and DB111K-174**: These datasets are used for type inference tasks. They are also extracted from YAGO and DBpedia, respectively. The authors provide similar statistics for these datasets as well.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **DBP15K**, the citation is: > Zequn Sun, Wei Hu, Qingheng Zhang, and Yuzhong Qu. *Cross-lingual entity alignment via joint attribute-preserving embedding*. In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), pages 4396a4402, 2017.- For **YAGO26K-906** and **DB111K-174**, the citation is: > Junheng Hao, Muhao Chen, Wenchao Yu, Yizhou Sun, and Wei Wang. *Universal representation learning of knowledge bases by jointly embedding instances and ontological concepts*. In Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), pages 1709a1719, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
