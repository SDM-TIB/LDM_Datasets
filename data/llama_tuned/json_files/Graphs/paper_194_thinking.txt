To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Chebyshev Basis in Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-based Action Recognition" by Hichem Sahbi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of a novel spectral GCN for action recognition, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention two datasets:1. **SBU Interaction Dataset**: This dataset is described as an interaction dataset acquired using the Microsoft Kinect sensor, containing 282 moving skeleton sequences performed by two interacting individuals, belonging to 8 action categories. The dataset includes 15 joint skeletons for each action, with 3D coordinates encoded across video frames.2. **First-Person Hand Action (FPHA) Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1175 skeletons belonging to 45 action categories, performed by 6 different individuals in 3 scenarios. Each skeleton includes 21 hand joints, with 3D coordinates encoded across video frames.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **SBU Interaction Dataset**, the citation is: > K. Yun, J. Honorio, D. Chattopadhyay, T. L. Berg, and D. Samaras. *Two-person interaction detection using body pose features and multiple instance learning*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop, 2012.- For the **First-Person Hand Action (FPHA) Dataset**, the citation is: > G. Garcia-Hernando, S. Yuan, S. Baek, and T.-K. Kim. *First-Person Hand Action Benchmark with RGB-D Videos and 3D Hand Pose Annotations*. In CVPR, 2018.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
