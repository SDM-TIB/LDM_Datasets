To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Answering Conversational Questions on Structured Data without Logical Forms" by Thomas M Auller et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a novel approach to answering sequential questions based on structured data, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**, specifically looking for any explicit mentions of datasets. In this section, the authors mention evaluating their method on the **Sequential Question Answering (SQA) task**, which is a well-known dataset in the field of natural language processing. This indicates that the SQA dataset is the primary dataset used for their experiments.I will also check the **related work section** to see if there are any other datasets referenced. However, the focus remains on the SQA dataset as the primary dataset for their experiments.Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citation for the SQA dataset. The citation for the SQA dataset is:- For the **Sequential Question Answering (SQA) dataset**, the citation is: > Mohit Iyyer, Wen-tau Yih, and Ming-Wei Chang. *Search-based neural structured learning for sequential question answering*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1821a1831, Vancouver, Canada, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research paper.
