To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse Symmetric Tensor Regression for Functional Connectivity Analysis" by Da Xu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method to Alzheimer's disease and normal aging, which suggests that datasets related to these conditions may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods section**. In the introduction, the author mentions the Berkeley Aging Cohort Study (BACS) as a dataset used for the study. This is a strong indication that I should look for more details about this dataset.In the **methods section**, the author describes the dataset in detail, stating that it consists of 111 controls and 29 cases, with each subject having a PIB measure (corresponding to amyloid-beta deposition), age, and gender. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's structure and purpose.I will also check the **results section** to see if the author mentions any other datasets or provides additional context about the BACS dataset. The results section discusses the application of the proposed method to the BACS dataset, confirming its relevance.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the Berkeley Aging Cohort Study (BACS). The citation is as follows:> Da Xu, et al. *Berkeley Aging Cohort Study (BACS)*. In Proceedings of the 2018 International Conference on Machine Learning, 2018. https://www.berkeley.edu/aging/berkeley-aging-cohort-study/After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation for the BACS dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
