To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GCNv2: Efficient Correspondence Prediction for Real-Time SLAM" by Jiexiong Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a deep learning-based network for visual odometry and mentions the use of RGB-D sensors, which suggests that datasets related to visual odometry might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section V) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention two datasets:1. **TUM Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being used for training the original GCN model. The citation is: > J. Sturm, N. Engelhard, F. Endres, W. Burgard, and D. Cremers. *A benchmark for the evaluation of RGB-D SLAM systems*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pages 1-6, 2012.2. **SUN-3D Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as being used for training the GCNv2 model. The citation is: > J. Xiao, A. Owens, and A. Torralba. *SUN-3D: A database of big spaces reconstructed using SfM and object labels*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1-9, 2013.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For the **TUM Dataset**, the citation is the same as mentioned above.- For the **SUN-3D Dataset**, the citation is also the same as mentioned above.Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
