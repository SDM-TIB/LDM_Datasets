To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A System for Automated Open-Source Threat Intelligence Gathering and Management" by Peng Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for high-quality Open-Source Cyber Threat Intelligence (OSCTI) and mentions the collection of OSCTI reports, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methodology sections**. In the introduction, the authors highlight the challenges in OSCTI gathering and management, but they do not explicitly mention specific datasets. I will need to look deeper into the methodology for more details.In the **methodology section**, particularly in **section 2.2 (OSCTI Reports Collection)**, the authors describe the crawler framework that collects OSCTI reports from various sources, including major security websites. They mention that they have collected over 120K+ OSCTI reports, which indicates that this is a significant dataset for their research. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset in the text.I will also check the **related work section** to see if any other datasets are referenced. The authors cite various sources, but they do not explicitly mention any additional datasets used in their experiments or analysis.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find any datasets or sources that might be relevant to the OSCTI reports. The references include various security-related websites and organizations, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned with a detailed description.Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset name or citation, I will summarize the findings:1. **OSCTI Reports**: The authors collected over 120K+ OSCTI reports from various sources, including major security websites. However, they do not provide a specific name or citation for this dataset in the paper.Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, noting that while the paper discusses the collection of OSCTI reports, it does not provide a formal dataset name or citation. This is crucial for any downstream analysis or reference.
