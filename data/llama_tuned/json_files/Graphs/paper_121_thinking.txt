To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid and Non-Uniform Quantization Methods Using Retro Synthesis Data for Efficient Inference" by Tej Pratap et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a method for efficient inference using retro-synthesis data, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction discusses the challenges of quantization methods and mentions the use of "retro-synthesis data," but it does not specify the datasets.In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors describe the generation of "retro-synthesis data" from the FP32 model layer statistics, which is a key dataset for their experiments. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset in the methodology section.I will then examine the **experimental results section** to see if the authors refer to any publicly available datasets or benchmarks used for evaluation. They mention performance comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on the **ImageNet** and **CIFAR-10** datasets, indicating that these datasets are likely used for their experiments.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For **ImageNet**, the citation is: > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248a255, 2009.2. For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, and Vinod Nair. *CIFAR-10: A dataset and toolbox for learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.3. Since the authors generated their own "retro-synthesis data," I will note that this dataset is not publicly available and is specific to their research.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the publicly available datasets. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
