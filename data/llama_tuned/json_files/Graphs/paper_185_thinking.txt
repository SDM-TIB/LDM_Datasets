To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Label-Aware Graph Convolutional Networks" by Hao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed framework and mentions conducting extensive node classification experiments on benchmark datasets, indicating that datasets are indeed used.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention four benchmark datasets: **Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, and Reddit**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the datasets as follows:1. **Cora**: A dataset used for node classification, containing 2,708 nodes and 5,134 edges.2. **Citeseer**: Another dataset for node classification, consisting of 3,333 nodes and 4,883 edges.3. **Pubmed**: This dataset is used for node classification, containing 6,268 nodes and 3,333 edges.4. **Reddit**: A dataset for node classification, featuring 15,808 nodes and 37,201 edges.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **Cora**, the citation is: > Will Hamilton, Zhitao Ying, and Jure Leskovec. *Inductive representation learning on large graphs*. In NIPS, 2017.- For **Citeseer**, the citation is: > Will Hamilton, Zhitao Ying, and Jure Leskovec. *Inductive representation learning on large graphs*. In NIPS, 2017.- For **Pubmed**, the citation is: > Will Hamilton, Zhitao Ying, and Jure Leskovec. *Inductive representation learning on large graphs*. In NIPS, 2017.- For **Reddit**, the citation is: > Will Hamilton, Zhitao Ying, and Jure Leskovec. *Inductive representation learning on large graphs*. In NIPS, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
