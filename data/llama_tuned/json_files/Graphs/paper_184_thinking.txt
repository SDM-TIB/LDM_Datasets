To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Anomalies Through Contrast in Heterogeneous Data" by Debanjan Datta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of anomaly detection in heterogeneous data, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, specifically:1. **KDDCup99**: This dataset is a benchmark for anomaly detection tasks, where the authors specify that they use the 10% dataset for their experiments.2. **KDDCup99-N**: This dataset is a variation of the KDDCup99 dataset, where the authors use the 10% data with the "Neptune" class labeled as normal and the rest as anomalies.3. **UNSW-NB15**: This dataset is used for network intrusion detection systems, where the authors select data with the "Normal" class as normal data and the "Backdoor", "Analysis", "Shellcode", and "Worms" classes as anomalies.4. **NSL-KDD**: This dataset is also used for network intrusion detection, with the "Normal" class as normal data and the rest as anomalies.5. **Gure-KDD**: This dataset is another network intrusion detection dataset, where the "Normal" class is used for normal data and the rest as anomalies.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For **KDDCup99**, the citation is: > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/- For **KDDCup99-N**, the citation is the same as KDDCup99 since it is a variation of the same dataset.- For **UNSW-NB15**, the citation is: > N. Moustafa and J. Slay. *UNSW-NB15: A comprehensive dataset for network intrusion detection systems*. In 2015 Military Communications and Information Systems Conference (MilCIS), 1a6.- For **NSL-KDD**, the citation is: > Mahbod Tavallaee, Ebrahim Bagheri, Wei Lu, and Ali A Ghorbani. *A detailed analysis of the KDD Cup 99 data set*. In 2009 IEEE symposium on computational intelligence for security and defense applications, 1a6.- For **Gure-KDD**, the citation is: > IAigo Perona, Ibai Gurrutxaga, Olatz Arbelaitz, JosA I. MartAn, Javier Muguerza, and JesAos Ma PArez. *Service-Independent Payload Analysis to Improve Intrusion Detection in Network Traffic*. In Proceedings of the 7th Australasian Data Mining Conference, Australian Computer Society, Inc., AUS.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
