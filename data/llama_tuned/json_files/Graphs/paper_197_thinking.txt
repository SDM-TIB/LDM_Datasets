To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hebbian Semi-Supervised Learning in a Sample Efficiency Setting" by Gabriele Lagani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors performed experiments on various object recognition datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 6) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:1. **CIFAR10**: This dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, belonging to 10 classes. The training images were randomly split into a training set of 40,000 images and a validation set of 10,000 images.2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10, this dataset also contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, but it belongs to 100 classes. The training images were also split into a training set of 40,000 images and a validation set of 10,000 images.3. **Tiny ImageNet**: This dataset contains 100,000 training images and 10,000 test images, belonging to 200 classes. The training images were randomly split into a training set of 90,000 images and a validation set of 10,000 images.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is: > J. Wu, Q. Zhang, G. Xu. *Tiny ImageNet challenge*. Technical report, Stanford University, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, into a structured format for further processing or review. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
