To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text2Node: a Cross-Domain System for Mapping Arbitrary Phrases to a Taxonomy" by Rohollah Soltani and Alexandre Tomberg, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a system for mapping medical phrases to concepts in a large taxonomy, which suggests that datasets related to medical phrases and taxonomies might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention the following datasets:1. **ICD-9-CM Diagnosis phrases**: This dataset is used for mapping ICD-9-CM diagnosis phrases to SNOMED CT concepts. The authors provide a citation for this dataset, which is:- U.S. National Library of Medicine. *ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes to SNOMED CT map*, 2015.2. **MIMIC-III Clinical Database**: This dataset is used for generating word embeddings and is referenced as a source of free text admission and discharge notes. The citation for this dataset is:- Alistair EW Johnson, Tom J Pollard, Lu Shen, H Lehman Li-wei, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G Mark. *MIMIC-III, freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific data, 3:160035, 2016.3. **SNOMED CT**: This is a large taxonomy used as the target graph for mapping phrases. The authors reference it as the primary taxonomy for their experiments, but they do not provide a specific citation for SNOMED CT itself, as it is a well-known and widely used taxonomy in the field.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, along with their respective citations for future reference or analysis.
