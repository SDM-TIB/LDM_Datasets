To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hypergraph Neural Networks" by Yifan Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two tasks: citation network classification and visual object recognition, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention two datasets:1. **Cora Dataset**: This dataset is used for citation network classification. The authors provide details about the number of nodes, edges, and classes, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.2. **Pubmed Dataset**: Similar to the Cora dataset, this is also used for citation network classification. The authors provide similar details about the number of nodes, edges, and classes.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For the **Cora Dataset**, the citation is: > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective Classification in Network Data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-100.- For the **Pubmed Dataset**, the citation is: > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective Classification in Network Data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-100.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets effectively for further processing or review.
