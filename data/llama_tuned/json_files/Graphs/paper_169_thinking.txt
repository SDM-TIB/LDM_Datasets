To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constant Curvature Graph Convolutional Networks" by Gregor Bachmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of a new method for graph neural networks but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction for more details.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three synthetic datasets and three real datasets for node classification tasks. The synthetic datasets are:1. **Treeaa**: A balanced tree of depth 5 and branching factor 4, consisting of 1365 nodes and 1364 edges.2. **Torusa**: A dataset sampled from the unit connected square, with 1000 nodes and 30626 edges.3. **Spherical Grapha**: A dataset sampled from S2, connecting nodes if their distance is smaller than 0.2, resulting in 1000 nodes and 17640 edges.I will also check the **experiments section** for any additional datasets or details about the real datasets used for node classification. The authors mention the following real datasets:1. **CiteSeer**: A dataset for node classification, containing 6,169 nodes and 3,711 edges.2. **Cora-ML**: A dataset for node classification, consisting of 2,718 nodes and 5,358 edges.3. **Pubmed**: A dataset for node classification, containing 19,999 nodes and 43,003 edges.Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For **Treeaa**, the citation is: > Gu, A., Sala, F., Gunel, B., and Ré, C. *Learning mixed-curvature representations in product spaces*. Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.- For **Torusa**, the citation is: > Gu, A., Sala, F., Gunel, B., and Ré, C. *Learning mixed-curvature representations in product spaces*. Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.- For **Spherical Grapha**, the citation is: > Gu, A., Sala, F., Gunel, B., and Ré, C. *Learning mixed-curvature representations in product spaces*. Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.- For **CiteSeer**, the citation is: > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Gallagher, B., and Eliassi-Rad, T. *Collective Classification in Network Data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93106, 2008.- For **Cora-ML**, the citation is: > McCallum, A., Nigam, K., Rennie, J., and Seymore, K. *Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning*. Information Retrieval, 3(2):127163, 2000.- For **Pubmed**, the citation is: > Namata, G., London, B., Getoor, L., and Huang, B. *Query-driven Active Surveying for Collective Classification*. International Workshop on Mining and Learning with Graphs (MLG), 2012.After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
