To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Card Shuffling Hypotheses: Building Time and Memory Efficient Graph Convolutional Networks" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the design of time and memory efficient graph convolutional networks, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction for more context.In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and mention the use of various datasets for evaluation. However, they do not specify the datasets used in their experiments. I will need to look deeper into the **experiments section** to find the actual datasets used.Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:1. **ModelNet40**: This dataset consists of 12,311 meshed CAD models across 40 categories, which is commonly used for point cloud classification tasks.2. **ShapeNetPart**: This dataset contains 16 object categories with 16,881 3D shapes, annotated with 50 parts, used for part segmentation tasks.3. **S3DIS**: This dataset consists of indoor scenes with 272 rooms in six indoor areas, annotated with 13 semantic categories, utilized for semantic segmentation tasks.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is: > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., et al. *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Learning Model for 3D Shape Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on 3D Vision (ICCV), 2015.- For **ShapeNetPart**, the citation is: > Chang, A. X., Funkhouser, T., Guibas, L., Hanrahan, P., Huang, Q., Li, Z., Savarese, S., Savva, M., Song, S., Su, H., et al. *Shapenet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.- For **S3DIS**, the citation is: > Armeni, I., Sener, O., Zamir, A. R., Jiang, H., Brilakis, I., Fischer, M., & Savarese, S. *3D Semantic Parsing of Large-Scale Indoor Spaces*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
