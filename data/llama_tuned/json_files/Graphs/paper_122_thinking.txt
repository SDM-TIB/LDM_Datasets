To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modelling Drug-Target Binding Affinity Using a BERT Based Graph Neural Network" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach on two drug-target interaction datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention two datasets:1. **Davis Kinase Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating drug-target interaction models, specifically focusing on kinase inhibitors. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of unique proteins and drugs, which is crucial for understanding its scope.2. **KIBA Dataset**: This dataset is also used for evaluating drug-target interaction models, focusing on kinase inhibitors. The authors describe the dataset's structure and the types of interactions included, which is essential for understanding its application in their research.In the **results section**, the authors confirm the use of these datasets for their experiments, reinforcing their significance in the study.Now, I will check the **references section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Davis Kinase Dataset**, the citation is: > Mindy I Davis, Jeremy P Hunt, Sanna Herrgard, Pietro Ciceri, Lisa M Wodicka, Gabriel Pallares, Michael Hocker, Daniel K Treiber, and Patrick P Zarrinkar. *Comprehensive analysis of kinase inhibitor selectivity*. Nature biotechnology, 29(11):1046a1051, 2011.- For the **KIBA Dataset**, the citation is: > Jing Tang, Agnieszka Szwajda, Sushil Shakyawar, Tao Xu, Petteri Hintsanen, Krister Wennerberg, and Tero Aittokallio. *Making sense of large-scale kinase inhibitor bioactivity data sets: a comparative and integrative analysis*. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 54(3):735a743, 2014.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
