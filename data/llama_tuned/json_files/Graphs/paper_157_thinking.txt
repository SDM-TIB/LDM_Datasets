To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis of Atomistic Representations Using Weighted Skip-Connections" by Kim A. Nicoli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on two datasets: **QM9 and MD17**. This is a good starting point.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for more details about these datasets. The introduction mentions that the authors evaluate their method on both the **QM9 dataset** and the **MD17 dataset**, confirming their relevance.In the **results section**, the authors provide specific details about how they used these datasets for their experiments. They mention that they predict internal energy and force fields for the **QM9 dataset**, which contains 14,133 organic molecules. For the **MD17 dataset**, they analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of benzene, ethanol, salicylic acid, and aspirin, focusing on energy and force predictions.Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **QM9 dataset**, the citation is: > Raghunathan Ramakrishnan, Pavlo O Dral, Matthias Rupp, and O Anatole von Lilienfeld. *Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules*. Sci. Data, 1, 2014.2. For the **MD17 dataset**, the citation is: > Kristof T SchA14tt, Pieter-Jan Kindermans, Huziel E Sauceda, Felix, Stefan Chmiela, Alexandre Tkatchenko, and Klaus-Robert MAA14ller. *SchNet: A continuous-ilter convolutional neural network for modeling quantum interactions*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 991a1001, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
