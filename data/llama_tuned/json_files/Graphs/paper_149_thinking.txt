To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Diffusion-Embedding Networks" by Bo Jiang, Doudou Lin, and Jin Tang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention testing their model on the **CiteSeer, Cora, and Pubmed citation networks**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are used in their experiments.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.The datasets mentioned are:1. **CiteSeer**: This dataset is part of the citation network and is used for semi-supervised learning tasks.2. **Cora**: Another citation network dataset used for semi-supervised learning.3. **Pubmed**: The third citation network dataset included in the experiments.Now, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:- For **CiteSeer**, the citation is: > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.- For **Cora**, the citation is: > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.- For **Pubmed**, the citation is: > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
