To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VERSE: Versatile Graph Embeddings from Similarity Measures" by Anton Tsitsulin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various graph mining tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention six real datasets:1. **BlogCatalog**: A network of social interactions among bloggers, with node labels representing topic categories.2. **Microsoft Academic Graph**: A network of academic papers, citations, authors, and affiliations.3. **VK**: A Russian social network with two snapshots extracted for link appearance analysis.4. **YouTube**: A network of social interactions among users, with labels representing groups of viewers by video genres.5. **Orkut**: A network of social interactions among users, with labels representing communities of users.6. **CoAuthor**: A co-authorship network among authors, used for link prediction and node classification tasks.I will then check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **BlogCatalog**, the citation is: > R. Zafarani and H. Liu. *Social Computing Data Repository at ASU*. (2009). http://socialcomputing.asu.edu- For **Microsoft Academic Graph**, the citation is: > Microsoft Academic Graph - KDD cup 2016. (2016). https://kddcup2016.azurewebsites.net/Data- For **VK**, the citation is: > VK is a Russian all-encompassing social network. (2016). No specific citation available, but it is referenced in the context of the paper.- For **YouTube**, the citation is: > Lei Tang and Huan Liu. *Scalable learning of collective behavior based on sparse social dimensions*. In CIKM, 1107a1116, 2009.- For **Orkut**, the citation is: > Jaewon Yang and Jure Leskovec. *Defining and evaluating network communities based on ground-truth*. Knowledge and Information Systems, 42(1):181a213, 2015.- For **CoAuthor**, the citation is: > CoAuthorship network among authors. (2016). No specific citation available, but it is referenced in the context of the paper.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
