To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GraphCGAN: Convolutional Graph Neural Network With Generative Adversarial Networks" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They refer to three standard citation network benchmark datasets: **Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about how they utilized these datasets, including the number of nodes per class and the total number of nodes used for training and testing. This information is crucial for a comprehensive description of each dataset.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **Cora**, the citation is: > Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Galligher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3):93a93, 2008.- For **Citeseer**, the citation is: > Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Galligher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3):93a93, 2008.- For **Pubmed**, the citation is: > Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Galligher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3):93a93, 2008.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
