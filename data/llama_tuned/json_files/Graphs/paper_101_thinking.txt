    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cognitive Graph for Multi-Hop Reading Comprehension at Scale" by Ming Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **HotpotQA fullwiki dataset**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology. Here, they explicitly mention the **HotpotQA fullwiki dataset** as the primary dataset used for their experiments. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of questions, the structure of the data, and the context in which it was used.In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the **HotpotQA fullwiki dataset** is the dataset they utilized for evaluating their proposed framework. This reinforces its significance in their research.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **HotpotQA fullwiki dataset**. The citation is as follows:- For **HotpotQA fullwiki dataset**, the citation is: > Zhilin Yang, Peng Qi, Saizheng Zhang, Yoshua Benjio, William Cohen, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and Christopher D Manning. *HotpotQA: A dataset for diverse, explainable multi-hop question answering*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2369a2380, 2018.Since the paper primarily focuses on the **HotpotQA fullwiki dataset**, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
