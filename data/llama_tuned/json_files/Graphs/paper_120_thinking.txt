To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Forecasting" by Jun Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors verify their method on two real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they describe two datasets:1. **SZ-taxi Dataset**: This dataset records the traffic speed of 156 major roads in Luohu District, Shen Zhen, from January 1 to January 31, 2015. The data is aggregated every 15 minutes.2. **Los-loop Dataset**: This dataset collects the traffic speed of 207 highways in Los Angeles County from March 1 to March 7, 2012, with data aggregated every 5 minutes.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide additional details about how these datasets were split into training and evaluation sets, which confirms their relevance for the experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For the **SZ-taxi Dataset**, the citation is: > F. Guerrini. *Traffic congestion costs Americans $124 billion a year, report says*. Forbes, October, vol. 14, 2014.- For the **Los-loop Dataset**, the citation is: > J. Liu and W. Guan. *A summary of traffic flow forecasting methods*. Journal of Highway and Transportation Research and Development, vol. 3, pp. 82a85, 2004.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
