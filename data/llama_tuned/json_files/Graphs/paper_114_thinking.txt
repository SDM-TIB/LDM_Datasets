To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating Typed Syntactic Dependencies for Targeted Sentiment Classification Using Graph Attention Neural Network" by Xuefeng Bai, Pengbo Liu, and Yue Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of graph attention networks for targeted sentiment classification, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using four benchmark datasets for their experiments:1. **Restaurant Dataset**: This dataset is used for aspect-based sentiment analysis, containing reviews from restaurants.2. **Laptop Dataset**: Similar to the restaurant dataset, this one is also used for aspect-based sentiment analysis, focusing on laptop reviews.3. **Twitter Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for targeted sentiment classification on Twitter posts.4. **MAMS Dataset**: Another dataset for targeted sentiment classification, specifically designed for aspect-based sentiment analysis.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Restaurant Dataset**, the citation is: > Pontiki, M., Galanis, D., Pavlopoulos, J., Papageorgiou, H., Androutsopoulos, I., & Manandhar, S. (2014). *SemEval-2014 task 4: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval), 2014.- For the **Laptop Dataset**, the citation is: > Jiang, Q., Chen, L., Xu, R., Ao, X., & Yang, M. (2019). *A challenged dataset and effective models for aspect-based sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), 2019.- For the **Twitter Dataset**, the citation is: > Dong, L., Wei, F., Tan, C., Tang, D., Zhou, M., & Xu, K. (2014). *Adaptive sentiment target-dependent Twitter recursive neural network for classification*. In Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2014.- For the **MAMS Dataset**, the citation is: > Jiang, Q., Chen, L., Xu, R., Ao, X., & Yang, M. (2019). *A challenged dataset and effective models for aspect-based sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
