To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MANELA: A Multi-Agent Algorithm for Learning Network Embeddings" by Han Zhang and Hong Xu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a multi-agent model for learning network embeddings, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** (Section VI) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:1. **BlogCatalog**: This dataset is described as a network that depicts bloggers' relationships, containing 10,312 nodes, 333,983 undirected edges, and 39 labels. The labels represent topic categories provided by authors.2. **Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI)**: This dataset is a network that depicts the interaction of proteins, with 3,890 nodes, 38,292 undirected edges, and 50 different labels. The labels are derived from the hallmark gene set.3. **Wikipedia**: This dataset is a co-occurrence network of words present in Wikipedia, consisting of 4,777 nodes, 92,091 undirected edges, and 40 different labels.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **BlogCatalog**, the citation is: > L. Tang and H. Liu. *Scalable learning of collective behavior based on sparse social dimensions*. In Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, 2009, pp. 1107a1116.- For **Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI)**, the citation is: > A. Grover and J. Leskovec. *node2vec: Scalable feature learning for networks*. In Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2016, pp. 855a864.- For **Wikipedia**, the citation is: > L. v. d. M. Maaten and G. Hinton. *Visualizing high-dimensional data using t-SNE*. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 9, 2579a2605, 2008.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
