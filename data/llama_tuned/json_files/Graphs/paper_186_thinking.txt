To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inductive Graph Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Kriging" by Yuankai Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted empirical results on several real-world spatiotemporal datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention five datasets:1. **METR-LA**: This dataset is described as a traffic speed dataset from 207 sensors in Los Angeles over four months (Mar 1, 2012 to Jun 30, 2012).2. **NREL**: This dataset registers solar power output by 137 photovoltaic power plants in Alabama state in 2006.3. **USHCN**: This dataset contains monthly precipitation data from 1218 locations from 1899 to 2019.4. **SeData**: This dataset is a traffic speed dataset collected from 323 loop detectors in the Seattle highway network.5. **PeMS-Bay**: This dataset consists of a traffic speed time series of 325 sensors in the Bay Area from Jan 1, 2017 to May 13, 2017.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **METR-LA**, the citation is: > Li, Y., Yu, R., Shahabi, C., & Liu, Y. (2017). Diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network: Data-driven traffic forecasting. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.01926.- For **NREL**, the citation is: > NREL. (n.d.). Solar Power Data. Retrieved from https://www.nrel.gov/data/solar-power-data.- For **USHCN**, the citation is: > USHCN. (n.d.). US Historical Climatic Data. Retrieved from https://www.ushcn.com.- For **SeData**, the citation is: > Li, Y., Yu, R., Shahabi, C., & Liu, Y. (2017). Diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network: Data-driven traffic forecasting. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.01926.- For **PeMS-Bay**, the citation is: > Li, Y., Yu, R., Shahabi, C., & Liu, Y. (2017). Diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network: Data-driven traffic forecasting. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.01926.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
