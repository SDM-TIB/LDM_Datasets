To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hybrid Graph Neural Network Approach for Detecting PHP Vulnerabilities" by Rishi Rabheru et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their approach on an established synthetic dataset and a novel real-world dataset collected from GitHub, which suggests that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **datasets section** (section IV) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention two datasets:1. **SARD (Software Assurance Reference Dataset)**: This dataset is a collection of code samples for multiple programming languages, specifically designed for evaluating methods for detecting different types of bugs. The authors note that it contains both safe and unsafe samples for various vulnerabilities, including PHP vulnerabilities.2. **GitHub Dataset**: This dataset is a collection of PHP code samples extracted from GitHub repositories, specifically focusing on vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-site scripting, and OS Command injection. The authors describe how they curated this dataset by searching for relevant CVE entries and cloning GitHub repositories.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:- For **SARD**, the citation is: > National Institute of Standards and Technology. *Software Assurance Reference Dataset*. [Accessed April 10, 2020]. Available: https://samate.nist.gov/index.php/Software Assurance Reference Dataset.html- For **GitHub Dataset**, the citation is: > Bertrand C. Stivalet. *PHP Vulnerability Test Suite Generator*. [Accessed April 10, 2020]. Available: https://github.com/stivalet/PHP-Vuln-test-suite-generatorNow that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources from the paper.
