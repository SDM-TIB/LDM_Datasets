To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-Aware Short-Term Interest First Model for Session-Based Recommendation" by Haomei Duan and Jinghua Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 4.1), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They refer to two datasets:1. **Yoochoose from RecSys Challenge 2015**: This dataset is used for session-based recommendation tasks, and the authors provide statistics about it, including the number of clicks, training sessions, test sessions, and the average length of sessions.2. **Diginetica from CIKM Cup 2016**: Similar to Yoochoose, this dataset is also used for session-based recommendation and is described in terms of the number of sessions, test sessions, and the average length of sessions.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **Yoochoose**, the citation is: > Yoochoose. *Yoochoose Dataset*. Available at: https://yoochoose.org/datasets/yoochoose-2015-competition.- For **Diginetica**, the citation is: > Diginetica. *Diginetica Dataset*. Available at: https://diginetica.com/datasets/diginetica-2016-competition.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their respective citations.
