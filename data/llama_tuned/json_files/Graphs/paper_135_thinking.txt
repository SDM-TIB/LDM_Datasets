To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Pre-training with Adversarial Fine-tuning for Zero-shot Expert Linking" by Bo Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for evaluation.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets used for their experiments:1. **AMiner**: This dataset is described as the basis for pre-training the model, containing over 100 million researcher profiles and 200 million papers from multiple databases. The citation is: > Tang, J., Zhang, J., Yao, L., Li, J., Zhang, L., and Su, Z. *AMiner: Extraction and Mining of Academic Networks*. In Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 990a998, 2008.2. **News**: This dataset consists of news articles collected from various Chinese technology platforms, with a focus on extracting names from these articles. The citation is: > Zhang, Y., Tang, J., Yao, P., and Tang, J. *Cosnet: Connecting Heterogeneous Social Networks with Local and Global Consistency*. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 1485a1494, 2015.3. **LinkedIn**: This dataset is derived from the LinkedIn dataset, where candidates are linked to AMiner experts based on similar names. The citation is: > Zhang, Y., Tang, J., Yao, P., and Tang, J. *Cosnet: Connecting Heterogeneous Social Networks with Local and Global Consistency*. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 1485a1494, 2015.After identifying the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset as follows:- For **AMiner**, the citation is: > Tang, J., Zhang, J., Yao, L., Li, J., Zhang, L., and Su, Z. *AMiner: Extraction and Mining of Academic Networks*. In Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 990a998, 2008.- For **News**, the citation is: > Zhang, Y., Tang, J., Yao, P., and Tang, J. *Cosnet: Connecting Heterogeneous Social Networks with Local and Global Consistency*. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 1485a1494, 2015.- For **LinkedIn**, the citation is: > Zhang, Y., Tang, J., Yao, P., and Tang, J. *Cosnet: Connecting Heterogeneous Social Networks with Local and Global Consistency*. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 1485a1494, 2015.Now, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
