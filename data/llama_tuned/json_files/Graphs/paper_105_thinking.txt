To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Logical Forms from Graph Representations of Text and Entities" by Peter Shaw et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses semantic parsing tasks and mentions the use of datasets for evaluation, which indicates that datasets are present.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a subsection that details the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets: **GEOATIS**, **ATIS**, and **SPIDER**. I will extract details about each dataset, including their descriptions and any relevant citations.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide the following information about each dataset:1. **GEOATIS**: This dataset consists of natural language questions about US geography along with corresponding logical forms. The authors specify that they used 600 training examples and 280 test examples, and they mention the use of logical forms based on Functional Query Language (FunQL).2. **ATIS**: This dataset contains natural language queries about travel planning, with a total of 4473 training examples and 448 test examples. The logical forms are represented as lambda expressions.3. **SPIDER**: This is a large-scale dataset for complex and cross-domain semantic parsing and text-to-SQL tasks, containing 10,181 questions and 5,693 unique complex SQL queries across 200 database tables spanning 138 domains. The authors specify that they used the standard training set of 8,659 training examples and the development set of 1,034 examples.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **GEOATIS**, the citation is: > John M. Zelle and Raymond J. Mooney. *Learning to parse database queries using inductive logic programming*. In Proceedings of the thirteenth national conference on Artificial intelligence, Volume 2, pages 1050a1055, 1996.- For **ATIS**, the citation is: > Deborah A. Dahl, Madeleine Bates, Michael Brown, William Fisher, Kate Hunicke-Smith, David Pallett, Christine Pao, Alexander Rudnicky, and Elizabeth Shriberg. *Expanding the scope of the ATIS task: The ATIS-3 corpus*. In Proceedings of the workshop on Human Language Technology, pages 43a48, 1994.- For **SPIDER**, the citation is: > Tao Yu, Zifan Li, Zilin Zhang, Rui Zhang, and Dragomir Radev. *SPIDER: A large-scale human-labeled dataset for complex and cross-domain semantic parsing and text-to-SQL task*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 2 (Short Papers), volume 2, pages 588a594, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
