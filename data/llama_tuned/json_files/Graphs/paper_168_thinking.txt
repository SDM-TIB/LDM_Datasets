To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RECON: Relation Extraction using Knowledge Graph Context in a Graph Neural Network" by Anson Bastos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two standard relation extraction datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 4), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that they used two datasets:1. **Wikidata dataset**: This dataset is described as being created in a distantly-supervised manner by linking the Wikipedia English Corpus to Wikidata. It contains 353 unique relations, 372,059 sentences for training, and 360,334 for testing.2. **NYT Freebase dataset**: This dataset was annotated by linking New York Times articles with Freebase Knowledge Graph, consisting of 53 relations and having 455,771 sentences for training and 172,448 for testing.The authors also mention that they augmented both datasets with knowledge graph context, which is crucial for understanding the datasets' applications in their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Wikidata dataset**, the citation is: > Daniil Sorokin and Iryna Gurevych. *Context-Aware Representations for Knowledge Base Relation Extraction*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2017), pages 1784a1789, 2017.- For the **NYT Freebase dataset**, the citation is: > Sebastian Riedel, Limin Yao, and Andrew McCallum. *Modeling Relations and Their Menters without Labeled Text*. In Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, European Conference, ECML PKDD (Lecture Notes in Computer Science), Vol. 6323, Springer, 2010.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
