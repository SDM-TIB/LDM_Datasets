To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Localizing Visual Sounds the Hard Way" by Honglie Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on the **Flickr SoundNet dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methodology sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the **Flickr SoundNet dataset** again, confirming its significance in their work. They also introduce a new benchmark called **VGG-Sound Source (VGG-SS)**, which is derived from the **VGG-Sound dataset**. This indicates that both datasets are important for their research.In the **methodology section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention that they used the **Flickr SoundNet dataset** for self-supervised training and the **VGG-Sound dataset** for training and evaluating their proposed method. This confirms the datasets' roles in their experiments.Now, I will check the **references section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:1. **Flickr SoundNet Dataset**: The citation is: > Yusuf Aytar, Carl Vondrick, and Antonio Torralba. *SoundNet: Learning sound representations from unlabeled video*. In NeurIPS, 2016.2. **VGG-Sound Dataset**: The citation is: > Honglie Chen, Weidi Xie, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman. *VGG-Sound: A large-scale audio-visual dataset*. In Proc. ICASSP, 2020.After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
