To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MultiVERSE: a multiplex and multiplex-heterogeneous network embedding approach" by Pio-Lopez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on several biological and social networks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:1. **CKM**: A multiplex network describing physician innovation in Illinois, composed of 3 layers.2. **LAZEGA**: A multiplex social network composed of 3 layers based on co-working, friendship, and advice.3. **C.ELE**: A neuronal multiplex network composed of 3 layers representing different synaptic junctions.4. **ARXIV**: A network composed of 8 layers representing various ArXiv categories.5. **HOMO**: A network composed of 4 layers extracted from the original network on CoMuNe Lab.6. **DIS**: A disease multiplex network constructed from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD).7. **MOL**: A molecular multiplex network consisting of 3 layers: protein-protein interactions, pathways, and molecular complexes.I will also check the **evaluation protocol** to confirm the datasets used for link prediction and network reconstruction tasks. The authors specify that they evaluate their method on these datasets, which reinforces their relevance.Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:- For **CKM**, the citation is: > Coleman, J., Katz, E., and Menzel, H. *The diffusion of an innovation among physicians*. Sociometry, 20(4), 253a270, 1957.- For **LAZEGA**, the citation is: > Emmanuel, L. *The collegial phenomenon. The social mechanisms of cooperation among peers in a corporate law partnership*. 2001.- For **C.ELE**, the citation is: > Chen, B. L., Hall, D. H., and Chklovskii, D. B. *Wiring optimization can relateuronal structure and function*. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 103(12), 4723a4728, 2006.- For **ARXIV**, the citation is: > De Domenico, M., Porter, M. A., and Arenas, A. *Muxviz: a tool for multilayer analysis and visualization of networks*. Journal of Complex Networks, 3(2), 159a176, 2015.- For **HOMO**, the citation is: > De Domenico, M., Porter, M. A., and Arenas, A. *Muxviz: a tool for multilayer analysis and visualization of networks*. Journal of Complex Networks, 3(2), 159a176, 2015.- For **DIS**, the citation is: > Davis, A. P., Grondin, C. J., Johnson, R. J., Sciaky, D., McMorran, R., Wiegers, J., Wiegers, T. C., and Mattingly, C. J. *The comparative toxicogenomics database: update 2019*. Nucleic acids research, 47(D1), D948aD954, 2019.- For **MOL**, the citation is: > Drew, K., Lee, C., Huizar, R. L., Tu, F., Borgeson, B., McWhite, C. D., Ma, Y., Wallingford, J. B., and Marcotte, E. M. *Integration of over 9,000 mass spectrometry experiments builds a global map of human protein complexes*. Molecular systems biology, 13(6), 1a11, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
