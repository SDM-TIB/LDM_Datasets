To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Open Domain Recognition by Semantic Discrepancy Minimization" by Junbao Zhuo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a method for unsupervised open domain recognition (UODR) and mentions the use of two datasets for evaluation, which is a good starting point.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:1. **I2AwA**: This dataset is described as a replacement of the original AwA dataset for zero-shot learning, consisting of 50 animal classes with a total of 37,322 images and an average of 746 images per class. The authors also mention that they collected a source domain dataset with 40 known categories via Google image searching, resulting in 2,970 images after removing noisy images.2. **I2WebV**: This dataset is based on the ILSVRC-2012 dataset, which consists of 1,000 classes with a total of 1,279,847 images. The target domain is the validation set of WebVision, which contains 5,000 classes and 294,009 images. The authors highlight the challenges associated with this dataset due to the large domain discrepancy and the presence of many unknown categories.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **I2AwA**, the citation is: > Y. Xian, B. Schiele, and Z. Akata. *Zero-shot learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.04394, 2017.- For **I2WebV**, the citation is: > W. Li, L. Wang, W. Li, E. Agustsson, and L. Van Gool. *WebVision database: Visual learning and understanding from web data*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.02862, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
