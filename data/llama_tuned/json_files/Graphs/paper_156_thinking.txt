To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Contrastive Learning of Audio-Visual Video Representation" by Shuang Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on various downstream benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **UCF101, HMDB51, and ESC50 datasets** for action recognition and sound classification tasks. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the specific tasks they are used for.In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they evaluate their models on UCF101 for action recognition and HMDB51 for action recognition. They also mention using ESC50 for sound classification. This confirms that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For **UCF101**, the citation is: > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.2. For **HMDB51**, the citation is: > Hildegard Kuehne, Hueihan Jhuang, EstA Abaliz Garrote, Tomaso Poggio, and Thomas Serre. *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In ICCV, 2011.3. For **ESC50**, the citation is: > Karol J Piczak. *ESC: Dataset for environmental sound classification*. In Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on Multimedia, 2015.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
