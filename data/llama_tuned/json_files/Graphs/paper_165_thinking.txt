To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intriguing Properties of Contrastive Losses" by Ting Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the study of contrastive learning and mentions the construction of datasets with explicit and controllable competing features, which indicates that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention constructing datasets for their experiments, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper. I will look for a dedicated section that outlines the datasets used.In the **methods section**, the authors describe the datasets they constructed, specifically mentioning three datasets:1. **DigitOnImageNet**: This dataset involves overlaying MNIST digits onto ImageNet images via channel addition/summation.2. **MultiDigits**: This dataset is a modified version of MultiDigits, where the authors vary the number of digits placed on a shared canvas, allowing for the study of feature suppression in contrastive learning.3. **RandBit**: This dataset involves concatenating a real image with an image of a random integer, creating competing features for contrastive learning.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **DigitOnImageNet**, the citation is: > Ting Chen, Simon Kornblith, Mohammad Norouzi, and Geoffrey Hinton. *A simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.05709, 2020.- For **MultiDigits**, the citation is: > Ting Chen, Simon Kornblith, Kevin Swersky, Mohammad Norouzi, and Geoffrey Hinton. *Big self-supervised models are strong semi-supervised learners*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.10029, 2020.- For **RandBit**, the citation is: > Ting Chen, Simon Kornblith, Kevin Swersky, Mohammad Norouzi, and Geoffrey Hinton. *Big self-supervised models are strong semi-supervised learners*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.10029, 2020.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, into a structured format for further processing or review. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
