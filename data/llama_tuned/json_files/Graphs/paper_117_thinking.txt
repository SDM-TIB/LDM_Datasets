To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wasserstein Contrastive Representation Distillation" by Liqun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of deep learning and mentions the use of benchmark datasets for experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **CIFAR-100** dataset for model compression experiments and the **ImageNet** dataset for cross-modal transfer tasks. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics and the context in which they were used.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets:1. **CIFAR-100**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images (0.5K per class) and 10,000 test images. It is commonly used for benchmarking image classification models.2. **ImageNet**: This dataset contains 1.2 million images for training and 50,000 for validation, making it a large-scale dataset for image classification tasks.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.- For **ImageNet**, the citation is: > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In CVPR, 2009.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
