To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SPATIO-TEMPORAL CROP CLASSIFICATION ON VOLUMETRIC DATA" by Muhammad Usman Qadeer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their approach on two benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methodology sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention using multispectral satellite imagery and refer to the **Yolo County benchmark dataset** and the **Imperial County benchmark dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their data preprocessing steps and mention that they used the **Google Earth Engine Platform** for data processing. However, they do not provide specific details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will need to look for more information in the **results section** and the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets.The **results section** confirms that the authors used the **Yolo County benchmark dataset** and the **Imperial County benchmark dataset** for their experiments. Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **Yolo County benchmark dataset**, the citation is: > California Department of Water Resources (CDWR). *2016 statewide crop mapping GIS shapesfiles*. Accessed Jan. 07, 2020. Available: https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/statewide-crop-mapping.2. For the **Imperial County benchmark dataset**, the citation is the same as above, as it is part of the same dataset: > California Department of Water Resources (CDWR). *2016 statewide crop mapping GIS shapesfiles*. Accessed Jan. 07, 2020. Available: https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/statewide-crop-mapping.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
