To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gauge Equivariant Mesh CNNs for Shape Correspondence" by Pim de Haan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Gauge Equivariant Mesh CNNs for shape correspondence tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention two datasets:1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is used for digit classification experiments on embedded rectangular meshes. The authors describe how they generate various geometries based on the MNIST dataset, including isometric embeddings and curved geometries.2. **FAUST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 100 meshes of human bodies in various positions, used for shape correspondence tasks. The authors provide details about the vertices and the nature of the dataset.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.- For the **FAUST Dataset**, the citation is: > F. Bogo, J. Romero, M. Loper, and M. J. Black. *FAUST: Dataset and evaluation for 3D mesh registration*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3794a3801, 2014.Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
