To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Global Self-attention Mechanism for Graph Convolutional Networks" by Chen Wang and Chengyuan Deng, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the Global Self-attention mechanism on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using multiple benchmark datasets for node and graph classification tasks. The datasets listed are:1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset used for node classification.2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset for node classification.3. **Pubmed**: A citation network dataset for node classification.4. **COIL-RAG**: A dataset for graph classification.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **Cora**, the citation is: > Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Galligher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3):93a93, 2008.- For **Citeseer**, the citation is: > Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Galligher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3):93a93, 2008.- For **Pubmed**, the citation is: > Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Galligher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3):93a93, 2008.- For **COIL-RAG**, the citation is: > Asma Atamna, Nataliya Sokolovska, and Jean-Claude crivello. *SPI-GCN: A Simple Permutation-Invariant Graph Convolutional Network*. Apr 2019. preprint, HAL hal-02093451.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, into a structured format for further processing or review. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured accurately.
