To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MER-GCN: Micro-Expression Recognition Based on Relation Modeling with Graph Convolutional Networks" by Ling Lo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of deep learning techniques for micro-expression recognition, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of micro-expression classification.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two datasets:1. **CASME II Dataset**: This dataset is described as an improved version of the CASME dataset, containing 247 micro-expressions from 35 subjects, labeled based on Action Units (AUs). The authors note that the dataset suffers from class imbalance, which is a significant challenge in their experiments.2. **Kinetics Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a human action dataset, which is used for comparison with the MER-GCN model. The authors mention that the Kinetics dataset is not ideal for micro-expression recognition tasks due to its focus on human actions rather than micro-expressions.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For the **CASME II Dataset**, the citation is: > W.-J. Yan, X. Li, S.-J. Wang, G. Zhao, Y.-J. Liu, Y.-H. Chen, and X. Fu. *CASME II: An improved spontaneous micro-expression database and the baseline evaluation*. PLOS ONE, 9(1):e86041, 2014.- For the **Kinetics Dataset**, the citation is: > J. Carreira, E. Noland, C. Hillier, and A. Zisserman. *A short note on the kinetics-700 human action dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.06987, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
