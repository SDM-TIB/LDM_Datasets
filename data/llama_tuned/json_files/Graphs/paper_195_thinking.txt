To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SkillBot: Identifying Risky Content for Children in Alexa Skills" by Tu Le et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a significant amount of data from Alexa skills, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that describe the data collection process. In this paper, the authors mention collecting conversations from 3,434 Alexa kid skills, which is a key dataset for their analysis.I will look for specific details about the dataset, such as the number of conversations, the types of skills included, and any relevant characteristics of the data collected. The authors state that they collected 31,966 non-overlapping app behaviors from 3,434 Alexa apps, which is a significant dataset for their study.In the **results section**, the authors provide more context about the dataset, confirming that they analyzed conversations from 3,434 kid skills and identified 28 risky kid skills. This reinforces the importance of this dataset for their findings.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset in the references, but they mention that the dataset is derived from the Alexa Skills Store. However, they do reference the Alexa Skills Kit and the Alexa U.S. skills store, which are relevant to the dataset.The citation for the dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, but I can infer that it is related to the Alexa Skills Store. Therefore, I will cite the Alexa Skills Store as the source of the dataset: > Amazon. *Alexa Skills Store*. Available at: https://www.amazon.com/alexa-skills/b?ie=UTF8&node=13727921011.Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, I will note that it is derived from the Alexa Skills Store, which is a publicly available resource.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the relevant details and citation, even though the citation may not be formal. This will allow for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
