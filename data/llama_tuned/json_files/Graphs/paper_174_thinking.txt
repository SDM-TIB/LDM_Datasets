To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large age-gap face verification by feature injection in deep networks" by Simone Bianco, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper introduces a new method for face verification across large age gaps and mentions a dataset called the **Large Age-Gap (LAG) dataset**. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of face verification across age gaps and reference the **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset** as a benchmark for their method. This suggests that the LFW dataset is used for comparison purposes.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention the **Large Age-Gap (LAG) dataset** again, detailing its composition and the number of images collected. They also compare their method's performance on this dataset, confirming its significance in their experiments.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Large Age-Gap (LAG) dataset**. The citation is as follows:> Simone Bianco, "Large age-gap face verification by feature injection in deep networks," 2023.Since the paper does not provide a specific citation for the **LFW dataset** in the references, I will use the commonly known citation for it:- For **LFW**, the citation is: > G. B. Huang, M. Ramesh, T. Berg, and E. Learned-Miller, "Labeled Faces in the Wild: A Database for Studying Face Recognition in Unconstrained Environments," Technical Report 07-49, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Tech. Rep., 2007.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for both the **Large Age-Gap (LAG) dataset** and the **LFW dataset**. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
