To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accurate Pulmonary Nodule Detection in Computed Tomography Images Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" by Jia Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **LUNA16 Challenge**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to gather more context about the datasets. The authors mention the **LUNA16 Challenge** again, confirming its significance in their work. They also reference the **LIDC-IDRI dataset**, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. They state that the **LUNA16 Challenge** dataset was used, which consists of 1018 CT scans, and they also mention that they filtered out scans with specific criteria (slice thickness > 3 mm, inconsistent spacing, or missing slices). This confirms the dataset's relevance and its application in their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **LUNA16 Challenge**, the citation is: > A. A. A. Setio, A. Traverso, T. Bel, and et al. *Validation, comparison, and combination of algorithms for automatic detection of pulmonary nodules in computed tomography images: In arXiv:1612.08012, 2016*.2. For the **LIDC-IDRI dataset**, the citation is: > S.G. Armato, G. McLennan, L. Bidaut, and et al. *The lung imagedatabase consortium (LIDC) and image database resource initiative (IDRI): A completed reference database of lung nodules on CT scans*. Medical Physics, 38(2):915a931, 2011.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
