To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dissecting the Diffusion Process in Linear Graph Convolutional Networks" by Yifei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using three standard citation networks for their experiments: **Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the datasets as follows:1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset used for semi-supervised node classification. It contains 2,708 nodes and 5,429 edges, with a training split of 80% for training, 20% for validation, and 0% for testing.2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset, also used for semi-supervised node classification. It consists of 6,178 nodes and 3,327 edges, with a similar training split as Cora.3. **Pubmed**: A citation network dataset for semi-supervised node classification, containing 19,717 nodes and 3,327 edges, with the same training split as the other two datasets.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **Cora**, the citation is: > Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Galligher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93a93, 2008.- For **Citeseer**, the citation is: > Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Galligher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93a93, 2008.- For **Pubmed**, the citation is: > Prithviraj Sen, Galileo Namata, Mustafa Bilgic, Lise Getoor, Brian Galligher, and Tina Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93a93, 2008.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
