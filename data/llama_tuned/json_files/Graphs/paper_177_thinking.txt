To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Self-Supervised Gait Encoding Approach with Locality-Awareness for 3D Skeleton Based Person Re-Identification" by Haocong Rao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using four person Re-ID datasets:1. **BIWI**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method, and it contains dynamic skeleton data collected from a consumer depth camera.2. **IAS-Lab**: This dataset is another dataset used for person Re-ID, which includes skeleton sequences collected from a depth camera.3. **KS20 VisLabMulti-View Kinect Skeleton Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for multi-view person Re-ID tasks, providing a diverse set of skeleton sequences.4. **Kinect Gait Biometry Dataset (KGBD)**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed approach, containing skeleton data collected from a Kinect sensor.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **BIWI**, the citation is: > M. Munaro, A. Fossati, A. Basso, E. Menegatti, and L. Van Gool. *One-shot person re-identiication with a consumer depth camera*. In Person Re-Identification. Springer, 2014, pp. 161a181.- For **IAS-Lab**, the citation is: > M. Munaro, S. Ghidoni, D. T. Dizmen, and E. Menegatti. *A feature-based approach to people re-identification using skeleton keypoints*. In ICRA, 2014, pp. 5644a5651.- For **KS20 VisLabMulti-View Kinect Skeleton Dataset**, the citation is: > A. Nambiar, A. Bernardino, J. C. Nascimento, and A. Fred. *Context-aware person re-identification in the wild via fusion of gait and anthropometric features*. In International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition, 2017, pp. 973a980.- For **Kinect Gait Biometry Dataset (KGBD)**, the citation is: > V. O. Andersson and R. M. Araujo. *Person identification using anthropometric and gait data from Kinect sensor*. In AAAI, 2015.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
