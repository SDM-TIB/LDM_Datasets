To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hypergraph Convolution and Hypergraph Attention" by Song Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of hypergraph convolution and hypergraph attention, which suggests that datasets are likely used for evaluation.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used. In this paper, they mention using three citation network datasets for their experiments:1. **Cora Dataset**: This dataset contains 2,708 scientific publications divided into 7 categories, with a total of 5,429 edges. Each publication is represented as a binary bag-of-word vector.2. **Citeseer Dataset**: Similar to Cora, this dataset consists of 3,327 scientific publications divided into 6 categories, with a total of 4,732 edges. Each publication is also represented as a binary bag-of-word vector.3. **Pubmed Dataset**: This dataset comprises 19,717 scientific publications divided into 3 classes, with a citation network containing 44,338 links. Each publication is represented as a vectorial representation using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).4. **20-newsgroup Dataset**: This dataset is used for text categorization and consists of 16,242 articles divided into 4 groups, with binary occurrence values for 100 words.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Cora Dataset**, the citation is: > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.- For the **Citeseer Dataset**, the citation is: > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.- For the **Pubmed Dataset**, the citation is: > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.- For the **20-newsgroup Dataset**, the citation is: > McCallum, A., Nallan, B., Wang, C., Mar, J., & Zalaznick, D. (2000). Learning to classify text with support vector machines. In Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 1-8.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
