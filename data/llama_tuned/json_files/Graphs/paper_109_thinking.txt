To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Path-Augmented Graph Transformer Network" by Benson Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors compare their model against several benchmark molecular property prediction datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention that their model is tested on "7 benchmark molecular property prediction tasks." This suggests that there are multiple datasets involved, but I need to find their names and details.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:1. **QM7**: A dataset used for quantum mechanics property prediction.2. **QM8**: Another dataset for quantum mechanics property prediction.3. **QM9**: A dataset for quantum mechanics property prediction.4. **ESOL**: A dataset for physical chemistry property prediction.5. **Lipophilicity**: A dataset for physical chemistry property prediction.6. **BACE**: A dataset for biochemistry property prediction.7. **BBBP**: A dataset for biochemistry property prediction.I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **QM7**, the citation is: > Wu, Z., Ramsundar, B., Feinberg, E. N., Gomes, J., Geniesse, C., Pappu, A. S., Leswing, K., and Pande, V. *MolecularNet: A Benchmark for Molecular Machine Learning*. Chemical Science, 9(2):513a530, 2018.- For **QM8**, the citation is the same as QM7 since it is part of the same dataset.- For **QM9**, the citation is the same as QM7.- For **ESOL**, the citation is: > Wu, Z., Ramsundar, B., Feinberg, E. N., Gomes, J., Geniesse, C., Pappu, A. S., Leswing, K., and Pande, V. *MolecularNet: A Benchmark for Molecular Machine Learning*. Chemical Science, 9(2):513a530, 2018.- For **Lipophilicity**, the citation is the same as ESOL since it is part of the same dataset.- For **BACE**, the citation is: > Wu, Z., Ramsundar, B., Feinberg, E. N., Gomes, J., Geniesse, C., Pappu, A. S., Leswing, K., and Pande, V. *MolecularNet: A Benchmark for Molecular Machine Learning*. Chemical Science, 9(2):513a530, 2018.- For **BBBP**, the citation is the same as BACE since it is part of the same dataset.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
