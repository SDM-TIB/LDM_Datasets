To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks" by Vijay Prakash Dwivedi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the benchmark framework, but I need to look for specific dataset names in the introduction and datasets sections.Next, I will focus on the **datasets section** (Section 2) where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention a total of 12 datasets, which are crucial for the benchmarking process. I will extract the names and details of each dataset as they are listed in Table 1.In **Table 1**, the datasets are summarized with their characteristics, such as the number of graphs, classes, average nodes, and edge features. The datasets include:1. **ZINC**: A dataset for molecular graph regression, containing 10,000 train, 1,000 validation, and 1,000 test graphs.2. **AQSOL**: A dataset for graph regression, consisting of 9,823 molecular graphs with aqueous solubility values.3. **OGB-LSCOLLAB**: A link prediction dataset with approximately 235,000 nodes and edges, representing collaborations among scientists.4. **WikiCS**: A node classification dataset based on Wikipedia articles, containing 11,701 nodes and 216,123 edges.5. **MNIST**: A dataset for node classification, consisting of 55,000 training, 5,000 validation, and 10,000 test images converted into graphs.6. **CIFAR10**: Similar to MNIST, this dataset is used for node classification, with 45,000 training, 5,000 validation, and 10,000 test images converted into graphs.7. **PATTERN**: A dataset for graph pattern recognition, generated with the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) for community detection.8. **CLUSTER**: A dataset for semi-supervised graph clustering, also generated with the SBM.9. **CSL**: A dataset for graph classification, containing 150 graphs for node classification.10. **CYCLES**: A dataset for cycle detection, consisting of 10,000 graphs with and without cycles.11. **GraphTheoryProp**: A dataset for multi-task graph classification, containing graphs with various graph properties.12. **TSP**: A dataset for edge classification, representing the Traveling Salesman Problem.Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for the following citations:- For **ZINC**: > John J. Irwin, Teague Sterling, Michael M. Mysinger, Erin S. Bolstad, and Ryan G. Coleman. *ZINC: A free tool to discover chemistry for biology*.

This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
