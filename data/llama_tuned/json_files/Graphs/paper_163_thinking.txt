To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BayesGrad: Explaining Predictions of Graph Convolutional Networks" by Hirotaka Akita et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using a synthetic compound dataset and real datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations:1. **Tox21 Synthetic Data**: This dataset is used for training and validation tasks, containing 11,757 training, 295 validation, and 645 test samples, each associated with 12 toxicity type labels.2. **Tox21 Actual Data**: This dataset is used for a toxicity prediction task, containing 1,127 compounds with measured log solubility.3. **ESOL Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the approach in the context of solubility prediction, containing 1,127 compounds with measured log solubility.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For **Tox21**, the citation is: > Ruili Huang, Menghang Xia, Dac-Trung Nguyen, Tongan Zhao, Srilatha Saka-muru, Jinghua Zhao, Sampada A Shahane, Anna Rossoshek, and Anton Simeonov. *Tox21 challenge to build predictive models of nuclear receptor and stress response pathways as mediated by exposure to environmental chemicals and drugs*. Frontiers in Environmental Science, 3:85, 2016.- For **Tox21 Actual Data**, the citation is the same as above since it is part of the Tox21 challenge.- For **ESOL Dataset**, the citation is: > John S. Delaney. *ESOL: Estimating aqueous solubility directly from molecular structure*. Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences, 44(3):1000a1005, 2004. PMID: 15154768.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
