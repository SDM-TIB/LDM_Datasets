To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks: Make the Community Detection Much Better" by Yaping Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4.1), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they refer to two datasets:1. **DBLP Dataset**: This dataset is described as a monthly updated citation network dataset, which is heterogeneous and contains various node types (paper, author, and conference). The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, and features.2. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset is described as one of the most widely adopted datasets for heterogeneous graph analysis, containing information about directors, actors, and movie release dates. The authors specify the types of nodes (movie, director, and actor) and the meta-paths used for sampling data.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **DBLP Dataset**, the citation is: > DBLP. *DBLP Citation Network*. Available at: https://dblp.uni-trier.de/- For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is: > IMDB. *IMDB Dataset*. Available at: https://www.imdb.com/With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
