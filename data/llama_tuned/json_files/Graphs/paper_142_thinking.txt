To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Residual Correlation in Graph Neural Network Regression" by Junteng Jia and Austin R. Benson, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the limitations of traditional graph-based semi-supervised learning methods and hints at the use of real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention several datasets, including:1. **Ising Model**: This dataset is used for synthetic data generation, specifically for the Ising model, which simulates random configurations of spins on a grid graph.2. **U.S. Election Maps**: This dataset consists of county-level data from the U.S. and includes demographic and election statistics. The authors use both 2012 and 2016 statistics for their experiments.3. **Transportation Networks**: This dataset contains traffic data from cities, specifically Anaheim and Chicago, where each vertex represents a directed lane and edges connect lanes based on their types.4. **Sexual Interaction Network**: This dataset is derived from an HIV transmission study and includes 1,888 individuals, with race and sexual orientation used as vertex features to predict gender.5. **Twitch Social Network**: This dataset represents online friendships amongst Twitch streamers in Portugal, with principal components of statistics such as games played and streaming habits used to predict the logarithm of the number of viewers for each streamer.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.The citations I will extract are:- For the **Ising Model**, the citation is: > Barry A. Cipra. *An Introduction to the Ising Model*. Am. Math. Monthly, 1987.- For the **U.S. Election Maps**, the citation is: > U.S. Census Bureau. *County-level data datasets*. Available at: https://github.com/tonmcg/.- For the **Transportation Networks**, the citation is: > Transportation Network Data. *Transportation Network Data*. Available at: https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks.- For the **Sexual Interaction Network**, the citation is: > Martina Morris and Richard Rothenberg. *HIV Transmission Network Metastudy Project: An Archive of Data From Eight Network Studies, 1988-2001*. Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, 2011.- For the **Twitch Social Network**, the citation is: > Benedek Rozemberczki, Carl Allen, and Rik Sarkar. *Multi-scale Attributed Node Embedding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.13021, 2019.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources from the paper.
