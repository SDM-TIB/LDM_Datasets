To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentiable Graph Module (DGM) for Graph Convolutional Networks" by Anees Kazi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the DGM model on various domains, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled "Benchmark graph based datasets." Here, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for evaluation: **Cora, Pubmed, and CiteSeer**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the tasks they are used for.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the datasets as follows:1. **Cora**: This dataset consists of a single graph with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, and 1,433 features. The task is node classification.2. **Pubmed**: This dataset contains 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, and 500 classes. The task is also node classification.3. **CiteSeer**: This dataset has 3,327 nodes, 4,372 edges, and 3,703 features. The task is node classification.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **Cora**, the citation is: > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.- For **Pubmed**, the citation is: > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.- For **CiteSeer**, the citation is: > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and citation. This will provide a clear and structured output for further processing or review.
