To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CNN Acceleration by Low-Rank Approximation with Quantized Factors" by Nikolay Kozyrskiy and Anh-Huy Phan, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and mentions experiments on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets** for their experiments. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the specific tasks they were used for.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the datasets as follows:1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes and 600 images per class.3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset containing approximately 1 million images across 1,000 object classes.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.- For **ImageNet**, the citation is: > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work.
