To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structure-Augmented Text Representation Learning for Efficient Knowledge Graph Completion" by Bo Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of knowledge graph completion and mentions the use of various benchmarks, indicating that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention four datasets:1. **WN18RR**: A link prediction dataset derived from WordNet, consisting of English phrases and their semantic relations.2. **FB15k-237**: A subset of Freebase, containing real-world named entities and their relations.3. **UMLS**: A small knowledge graph containing medical semantic entities and their relations.4. **NELL-One**: A few-shot link prediction dataset derived from NELL, where the relations in the dev/test set never appear in the train set.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **WN18RR**, the citation is: > Tim Dettmers, Pasquale Minervini, Pontus Stenetorp, and Sebastian Riedel. *Convolutional 2D Knowledge Graph Embeddings*.

AAAI Press, 1811a1818. https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17366- For **FB15k-237**, the citation is: > Kristina Toutanova, Danqi Chen, Patrick Pantel, Hoifung Poon, Pallavi Choudhury, and Michael Gamon. *Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge Bases*.

Association for Computational Linguistics, 1980a1990. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/d18-1223After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
