To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph-Based Neural Network Models with Multiple Self-Supervised Auxiliary Tasks" by Franco Manessi and Alessandro Rozza, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses self-supervised learning and multi-task learning, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, particularly in the context of graph classification tasks.Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically the subsection titled **4.1. Datasets and Experimental Setup**. Here, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for their experiments:1. **Citeseer Dataset**: This dataset is described as a citation network where graph vertices correspond to documents and edges represent citations. It contains 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, and 6 classes.2. **Cora Dataset**: This dataset is also a citation network, with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, and 7 classes.3. **Pubmed Dataset**: This dataset consists of 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, and 3 classes.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Citeseer Dataset**, the citation is: > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.- For the **Cora Dataset**, the citation is: > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.- For the **Pubmed Dataset**, the citation is: > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
