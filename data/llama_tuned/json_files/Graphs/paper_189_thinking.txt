To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive and Generative Graph Convolutional Networks for Graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning" by Sheng Wan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors typically provide a summary of the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention six benchmark datasets: **Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed, Amazon Computers, Amazon Photo, and Coauthor CS**. I will take note of the number of nodes, edges, features, classes, and other relevant statistics for each dataset.In the **table 1 (Dataset statistics)**, the authors provide detailed statistics for each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, features, and classes. This information is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of each dataset.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:- For **Cora**, the citation is: > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., and Eliassi-Rad, T. *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3): 93a93, 2008.- For **CiteSeer**, the citation is: > Bojchevski, A., and G¨unnemann, S. *Deep Gaussian embedding of graphs: Unsupervised inductive learning via ranking*. In ICLR, 2018.- For **PubMed**, the citation is: > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., and Eliassi-Rad, T. *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3): 93a93, 2008.- For **Amazon Computers**, the citation is: > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., and G¨unnemann, S. *Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868, 2018.- For **Amazon Photo**, the citation is: > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., and G¨unnemann, S. *Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868, 2018.- For **Coauthor CS**, the citation is: > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., and G¨unnemann, S. *Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
