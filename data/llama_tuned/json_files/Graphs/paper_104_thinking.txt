To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLUTRR: A Diagnostic Benchmark for Inductive Reasoning from Text" by Koustuv Sinha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and benchmark design sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the CLUTRR benchmark suite, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **benchmark design section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention that they generated a large set of semi-synthetic stories involving hypothetical families, which indicates that there is a dataset related to kinship relations.I will also check the **experiments section** to see if they provide additional details about the datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention that they collected paraphrases from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) for their dataset, which is a crucial detail for the dataset's origin.Now, I will look for the **references section** to find the full citation for the CLUTRR benchmark suite. The paper does not provide a specific dataset citation, but it does mention that the entire benchmark suite, including code and datasets, is publicly available on GitHub. This indicates that the dataset is not a traditional dataset with a formal citation but rather a collection of generated stories and paraphrases.The CLUTRR benchmark suite is publicly available at: https://github.com/facebookresearch/clutrr.datasetsSince the paper does not provide a formal citation for the CLUTRR dataset, I will note that it is a semi-synthetic dataset generated for the purpose of this research.Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant details about the dataset, such as its purpose, the number of training and testing examples, and the method of data collection. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
