To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Similarity Graph Neural Network on Electronic Health Records" by Zheng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and hints at the datasets used for evaluation, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that describe the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention using the **MIMIC-III dataset** for their experiments. I will extract details about this dataset, including its characteristics and how it was utilized in the study.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the MIMIC-III dataset as a publicly available dataset consisting of health records of 46,520 intensive care unit (ICU) patients over 11 years. They provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of visits, diagnoses, and other relevant information. This section confirms the dataset's significance in their research.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset. The citation is as follows:> A. E. Johnson, T. J. Pollard, L. Shen, H. L. Li-wei, M. Feng, M. Ghassemi, B. Moody, P. Szolovits, L. A. Celi, and R. G. Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3:160035, 2016.With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry for MIMIC-III, ensuring to include the full citation as required.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
