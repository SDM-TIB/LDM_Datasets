To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Budget-Driven Hardware Optimization for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks using Stochastic Computing" by Zhe Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a specific dataset for experiments, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention using the **MNIST database** for handwritten digit image classification. This is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning, and I will need to provide a brief description and citation for it.In the **experimental results section**, the authors explicitly state that they used the MNIST database, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of size 28x28 grayscale images, with 10 classes. This information is crucial for a comprehensive description.Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:- For **MNIST**, the citation is: > Li Deng. *The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research*. IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 29(6):141a142, 2012.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MNIST dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
