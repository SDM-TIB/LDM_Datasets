To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Ranking for Representation Learning" by Ali Varamesh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets, which suggests that I should look for specific names and details in these sections.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using **STL10** and **MS-COCO** for their experiments. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.In the **experiments section**, the authors specify that they trained their model on **STL10**, which is described as a subset of ImageNet designed for research on unsupervised methods. They also mention using **MS-COCO** for evaluation, noting that it is a cluttered dataset that may not accurately represent real-world scenes due to its bias towards the person class.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For **STL10**, the citation is: > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In Proceedings of the fourteenth international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics, pages 215a223, 2011.2. For **MS-COCO**, the citation is: > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollAr, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 740a755, 2014.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
