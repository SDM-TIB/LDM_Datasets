To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal-RCNN: Universal Object Detector via Transferable Graph R-CNN" by Hang Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the Universal-RCNN model and its performance on multiple object detection benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets: **MSCOCO**, **Visual Genome (VG)**, and **ADE**. I will extract details about each dataset, including their characteristics and the number of images used for training and testing.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific information about each dataset:1. **MSCOCO**: This dataset contains 80 object classes, with 118K training images, 5K validation images, and 20K unannotated testing images.2. **Visual Genome (VG)**: This dataset has 88K images for training and 5K images for testing, with 1000 most frequent classes.3. **ADE**: This dataset consists of 445 classes and uses 20K images for training and 1K images for testing.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **MSCOCO**, the citation is: > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., DollAr, P., and Zitnick, C. L. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.- For **Visual Genome (VG)**, the citation is: > Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Kalantidis, Y., Li, L.-J., Shamma, D. A., Bernstein, M., and Fei-Fei, L. *Visual Genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2016.- For **ADE**, the citation is: > Zhou, B., Zhao, H., Puig, X., Fidler, S., Barriuso, A., and Torralba, A. *Scene parsing through ade20k dataset*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
