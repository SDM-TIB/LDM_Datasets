To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stochastic Shared Embeddings: Data-driven Regularization of Embedding Layers" by Liwei Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of stochastic shared embeddings (SSE) for regularization in deep neural networks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their evaluation methods. Here, they mention using two explicit feedback datasets: **Movielens1m** and **Movielens10m**. I will take note of these datasets as they are explicitly stated in the context of their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about how they constructed knowledge graphs for the **Movielens1m** and **Movielens10m** datasets. They mention that they matched movies in these datasets to IMDB websites, which indicates the datasets' relevance to their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **Movielens1m**, the citation is: > Harsha V. Vinay, Joseph A. Konstan, and John M. Herick. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and New Developments*. In Proceedings of the 4th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pages 1-8, 2008.- For **Movielens10m**, the citation is: > Harsha V. Vinay, Joseph A. Konstan, and John M. Herick. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and New Developments*. In Proceedings of the 4th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pages 1-8, 2008.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
