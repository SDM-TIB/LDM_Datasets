To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sigmoid-Weighted Linear Units for Neural Network Function Approximation in Reinforcement Learning" by Stefan Elfwingaelfwing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of neural networks for reinforcement learning, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of Atari 2600 games.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluations. They mention using the **SZ-Tetris** and **Atari 2600** environments for testing their proposed methods. This indicates that these are the datasets used in their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:1. **SZ-Tetris**: This dataset is a simplified version of Tetris that allows for faster evaluation of strategies due to shorter episodes. It is played on a 10x20 board with specific rules for tetrominoes.2. **Atari 2600**: This dataset consists of 12 Atari 2600 games, specifically selected for evaluation based on the letters "A" and "B" in their names.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **SZ-Tetris**, the citation is: > Szita, I., & SzepesvAri, C. (2010). SZ-Tetris as a benchmark for studying key problems of reinforcement learning. In ICML 2010 workshop on machine learning and games.- For **Atari 2600**, the citation is: > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47, 253a279.Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
