To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Large-Scale Fleet Management on a Road Network using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning with Graph Neural Network" by Juhyeon Kim and Kihyun Kim, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the optimization of fleet management using multi-agent reinforcement learning, which suggests that datasets related to ride-hailing services might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction highlights the challenges in ride-hailing services and mentions empirical demand and supply data, but it does not specify any datasets.In the **methods section**, I will look for any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The authors describe their simulator and mention that it emulates empirical taxi call data, which indicates that there is a dataset involved. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset in the methods section.I will then check the **experiments section** to see if the authors provide any additional details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention using aggregated and anonymized data from Kakao Mobility for their simulations, which is a significant dataset for their experiments.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to the dataset as "Kakao Mobility" but do not provide a specific paper or citation for it. However, I can infer that the dataset is likely a proprietary dataset used for their simulations.Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the Kakao Mobility dataset, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset used for their experiments and provide a general reference to Kakao Mobility as the source of the data.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, noting that the dataset is proprietary and does not have a formal citation. I will ensure to include the context in which the dataset was used in the paper.
