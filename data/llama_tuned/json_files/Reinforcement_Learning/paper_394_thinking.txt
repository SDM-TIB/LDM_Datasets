To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Addressing Function Approximation Error in Actor-Critic Methods" by Scott Fujimoto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a suite of OpenAI gym tasks, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **MuJoCo environments** for their experiments. This is a strong indication that a specific dataset or set of environments is being utilized.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on "seven continuous control domains from OpenAI gym." This confirms that the datasets are indeed related to the OpenAI gym tasks, which are commonly used in reinforcement learning research.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the OpenAI gym tasks. The relevant citation is:- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is: > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., and Zaremba, W. *OpenAI Gym*. 2016.Now, I will compile the dataset information, including the name of the dataset (OpenAI Gym tasks) and the citation, ensuring that I include all relevant details.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that the citation is complete and accurate for future reference.
