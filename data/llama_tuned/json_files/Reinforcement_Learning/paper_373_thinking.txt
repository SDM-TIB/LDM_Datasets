To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TREEQN AND ATREEC: DIFFERENTIABLE TREE-STRUCTURED MODELS FOR DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING" by Gregory Farquhara et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of TreeQN and ATreeC in reinforcement learning, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of Atari games.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention evaluating their methods on a box-pushing domain and a suite of Atari games. This indicates that specific datasets are being utilized.I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors mention using the **Atari 2600 suite**, which is a well-known dataset in the field of reinforcement learning. They specify that they use the set of nine Atari environments as defined by Oh et al. (2017) for their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Atari 2600 suite. The relevant citation is:- For the **Atari 2600 suite**, the citation is: > Junhyuk Oh, Satinder Singh, and Honglak Lee. *Value prediction network*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.03497, 2017.Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the Atari 2600 suite.After completing this process, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Atari 2600 suite, ensuring that it includes the necessary details such as the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
