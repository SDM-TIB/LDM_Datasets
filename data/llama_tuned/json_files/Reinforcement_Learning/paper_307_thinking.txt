To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving QSAT problems with neural MCTS" by Ruiyang Xu and Karl Lieberherr, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced or described. The abstract discusses the application of neural Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to solve QSAT problems, which suggests that datasets related to QSAT might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **implementation sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the QSAT problem and its relation to self-play, but they do not specify any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the methodology for any datasets used for training or evaluation.In the **implementation section**, the authors describe their approach to encoding QSAT problems as graphs and applying a graph neural network (GNN) to the QSAT game. They mention generating 20 random QBFs (Quantified Boolean Formulas) for testing, but they do not provide a specific dataset name. However, they do refer to an off-the-shelf QSAT solver called "GhostQ" for performance evaluation, which implies that there may be a dataset or benchmark related to QSAT problems.I will also check the **experiments section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors refer to any existing datasets for comparison or evaluation. The authors describe their experimental setup, including the generation of QBFs, but again, no specific dataset names are provided.After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets for QSAT problems. Instead, they rely on their own generated QBFs for testing their method. Therefore, I will note that while they created their own dataset of QBFs, they do not cite any external datasets.Since there are no formal datasets cited in the paper, I will summarize the findings as follows:1. **QSAT Problems Dataset**: The authors generated 20 random QBFs (10 solvable and 10 unsolvable) for testing their neural MCTS algorithm. However, they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset as it is generated for the purpose of their experiments.Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the lack of external datasets and the nature of the QBFs generated for testing purposes.
