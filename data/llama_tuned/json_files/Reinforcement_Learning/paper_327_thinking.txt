To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Semantic Alignment for Improved Image Captions" by Pierre Dognin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of a new semantic score and a diagnostic dataset called "Out of Context (OOC)" for evaluating captioning models, indicating that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **evaluation sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the challenges in image captioning and the need for datasets that can evaluate model performance. They also introduce the "Out of Context (OOC)" dataset, which is a key dataset for their experiments.In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation, specifically mentioning the **COCO dataset** and the newly introduced **Out of Context (OOC)** dataset. They describe the OOC dataset as a quick and useful diagnostic tool for checking model generalization to out-of-context scenes.I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used for evaluation. The authors state that they evaluate their method on the **COCO Test Set** and the **Out of Context (OOC)** set, reinforcing the datasets' significance in their research.Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is: > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge J. Belongie, Lawrence D. Bourdev, Ross Girshick, Jia Deng, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.2. For the **Out of Context (OOC)** dataset, the citation is: > Pierre Dognin, Igor Melnyk, Youssef Mroueh, Jerret Ross, and Tom Sercu. *Adversarial Semantic Alignment for Improved Image Captions*. IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, NY, 2023.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
