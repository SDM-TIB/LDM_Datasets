To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dialogue Systems with Large Action Spaces" by Gellert Weisz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of deep reinforcement learning for dialogue systems, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of dialogue management.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets used for their experiments. The introduction outlines the challenges in dialogue systems and mentions the use of reinforcement learning, but I need to look for specific datasets in the **experiments section** or any subsequent sections that detail the evaluation process.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their evaluation setup, which includes using the **Cambridge Restaurants domain** and the **CamInfo domain**. These domains are likely datasets or environments used for testing their reinforcement learning algorithms. I will look for detailed descriptions of these domains to confirm their nature as datasets.In the **appendix**, the authors provide a description of the **CamInfo action space**, which is a specific dataset used in their experiments. This section is crucial as it outlines the structure and content of the dataset, including the number of actions and the types of actions available.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the **Cambridge Restaurants domain** and the **CamInfo domain**. However, I need to ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For the **Cambridge Restaurants domain**, the citation is: > S. Ultes, L. M. Rojas-Barahona, P.-H. Su, D. Vandyke, D. Kim, I. Casanueva, P. Budzianowski, N. MrkEsiA c, T.-H. Wen, M. GaEsiA c, and S. J. Young. *PyDial: A multi-domain statistical dialogue system toolkit*. In ACL Demo. Association of Computational Linguistics, 2017.- For the **CamInfo domain**, the citation is: > S. Ultes, L. M. Rojas-Barahona, P.-H. Su, D. Vandyke, D. Kim, I. Casanueva, P. Budzianowski, N. MrkEsiA c, T.-H. Wen, M. GaEsiA c, and S. J. Young. *PyDial: A multi-domain statistical dialogue system toolkit*. In ACL Demo. Association of Computational Linguistics, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
