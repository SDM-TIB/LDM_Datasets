To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining Transition Systems Through Program Induction" by Svetlin Penkov and Subramanian Ramamoorthy, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the I-machine for inducing programs from observed data traces, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention applying the I-machine to three different problems, which may indicate the datasets used for these applications. I will look for specific datasets or references to datasets in the **experiments section**.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their evaluations on three problems: system identification of dynamical systems, explaining the behavior of a DQN agent, and learning by demonstration in a human-robot interaction scenario. I will look for any datasets explicitly mentioned in these sections, such as the names of the datasets used for training or testing the I-machine.The paper does not provide detailed descriptions of the datasets, but it does mention that the I-machine is applied to data from physics experiments and behavior traces of a reinforcement learning agent. This indicates that there may be specific datasets related to these applications, but I need to find their names and citations.Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The references include various works related to the I-machine and its applications, but I need to identify the specific datasets used in the experiments. Upon reviewing the references, I find the following datasets:1. **Dynamical Systems Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of system identification, but the authors do not provide a specific citation. However, I can infer that it is based on the work by Schmidt and Lipson (2009) regarding the learning of physical laws from experimental data.2. **DQN Behavior Traces Dataset**: This dataset is related to the behavior of a DQN agent and is implied to be derived from the behavior traces of the agent during gameplay. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, but it is associated with the work on DQN learning.3. **Human Demonstration Dataset**: This dataset is used in the learning-by-demonstration task and is referenced in the context of human-robot interaction. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, but it is related to the work on collaborative human-robot interaction.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details and citations. However, I will note that the datasets may not have formal citations as they are derived from existing works rather than being original datasets.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and any relevant citations. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
