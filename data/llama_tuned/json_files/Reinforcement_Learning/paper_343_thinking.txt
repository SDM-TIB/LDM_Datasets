To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Memory Lens: How Much Memory Does an Agent Use?" by Christoph Dann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the estimation of memory usage in reinforcement learning policies, which suggests that datasets related to these policies might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **method section**, where the authors describe their approach and the datasets used for evaluation. They mention estimating the memory capacity of Deep Q-Network policies trained on **49 Atari 2600 games**. This indicates that the Atari games dataset is crucial for their experiments.In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used, confirming that the Atari games dataset is the primary dataset for their analysis. They mention that they recorded 10,000 games played by each of the fully trained policies, which further emphasizes the significance of this dataset.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Atari games dataset. The relevant citation is:- For the **Atari 2600 games**, the citation is: > Volodymyr Mnih, Koray Kavukcuoglu, David Silver, Andrei Rusu, Joel Veness, Marc G Bellec, Alex Graves, Martin Riedmiller, Andreas K Fidjeland, Georg Ostrovski, Stig Petersen, Charles Beattie, Amir Sadik, Ioannis Antonoglou, Helen King, Dharshan Kumaran, Daan Wierstra, Shane Legg, and Demis Hassabis. *Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning*. Nature, 518(7540):529a533, 2015.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Atari games dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Atari games dataset, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
