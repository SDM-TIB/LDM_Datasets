To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BOOSTING NOISE ROBUSTNESS OF ACOUSTIC MODEL VIA DEEP ADVERSARIAL TRAINING" by Bin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **CHiME-4 corpus**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 5.1, **Datasets**), where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention two types of data:1. **Real noisy environments data**: This dataset consists of 1,600 real utterances recorded in various noisy environments (bus, cafe, pedestrian area, and street junction).2. **Simulated data**: This dataset includes 7,138 simulated utterances generated by mixing clean speech data from the **WSJ0 set** with noisy backgrounds. The training set consists of 3,280 utterances, and the test set consists of 2,640 utterances, with equal quantities of real and simulated data.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **CHiME-4 corpus**, the citation is: > Emmanuel Vincent, Shinji Watanabe, Aditya Arie Nugraha, Jon Barker, and Ricard Marxer. *An analysis of environment, microphone and data simulation mismatches in robust speech recognition*. Computer Speech and Language, 2016.- For the **WSJ0 set**, the citation is: > Daniel Povey, Arnab Ghoshal, Gilles Boulianne, Lukas Burget, Ondrej Glembek, Nagendra Goel, Mirko Hannemann, Petr Motlicek, Yanmin Qian, Petr Schwarz, et al. *The Kaldi speech recognition toolkit*. In Proceedings of the IEEE 2011 Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding, 2011.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
