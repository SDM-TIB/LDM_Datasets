To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FinRL: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Library for Automated Stock Trading in Quantitative Finance" by Xiao-Yang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the FinRL library utilizes stock market datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **environment section**. The authors mention that FinRL simulates trading environments across various stock markets, including NASDAQ-100, DJIA, S&P 500, HSI, SSE 50, and CSI 300. This indicates that these stock market indices are the datasets used in their experiments.In the **environment section**, the authors specify that the trading environments are constructed using six datasets across five stock exchanges. They list the datasets as follows:1. **NASDAQ-100**: A stock market index that tracks the 100 largest non-financial stocks listed on the NASDAQ stock market.2. **DJIA**: The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is a stock market index that represents the 30 largest and most actively traded stocks in the US.3. **S&P 500**: The S&P 500 Index, which is a stock market index that represents the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the US.4. **HSI**: The Hang Seng Index, which is a stock market index that represents the 50 largest and most actively traded stocks in Hong Kong.5. **SSE 50**: The Shanghai Stock Exchange 50 Index, which is a stock market index that represents the 50 largest and most actively traded stocks in Shanghai.6. **CSI 300**: The China Securities 300 Index, which is a stock market index that represents the 300 largest and most actively traded stocks in China.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **NASDAQ-100**, the citation is: > NASDAQ-100 Index. Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ-100.- For **DJIA**, the citation is: > DJIA Index. Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average.- For **S&P 500**, the citation is: > S&P 500 Index. Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500.- For **HSI**, the citation is: > Hang Seng Index. Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_Seng_Indice.- For **SSE 50**, the citation is: > SSE 50 Index. Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE_50.- For **CSI 300**, the citation is: > CSI 300 Index. Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSI_300.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
