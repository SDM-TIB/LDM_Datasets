To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Demonstrations for Deep Reinforcement Learning on Robotics Problems with Sparse Rewards" by Mel Vecerik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of demonstrations in reinforcement learning for robotics tasks, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention collecting demonstration data for their experiments, specifically stating that they collected **100 episodes of human demonstrations** for each task. This indicates that the dataset consists of demonstrations collected from human demonstrations, but I need to find the specific details about the dataset's structure and any relevant citations.I will also check the **related work section** to see if any other datasets are referenced. The authors cite various works related to reinforcement learning and imitation learning, but they do not introduce new datasets in this section. Therefore, I will focus on the **experiments section** for the primary dataset information.In the **experimental setup section**, the authors describe the tasks they conducted, including the insertion tasks and the use of the **Mujoco simulator** for simulation experiments. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name, as the data is generated from their own experiments and demonstrations. The paper does not reference any external datasets but rather describes the collection of demonstration data from human demonstrations.Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the details about the demonstration data collection process and the context in which it was used. Since the paper does not provide a formal dataset name, I will note that the primary dataset consists of human demonstrations collected for the experiments.Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for output, ensuring that I include the relevant details and citations where applicable.
