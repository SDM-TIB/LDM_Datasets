To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Genetic Algorithms Are a Competitive Alternative for Training Deep Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning" by Felipe Petroski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of genetic algorithms for training deep neural networks in reinforcement learning, which suggests that datasets may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly any subsections that detail the datasets used for experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Atari 2600** and **Humanoid Locomotion** datasets for their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **Atari 2600** dataset for training deep neural networks to play Atari games and the **Humanoid Locomotion** dataset for a continuous control problem involving a simulated humanoid robot. This confirms the datasets' relevance.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **Atari 2600**, the citation is: > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. J. Artif. Intell. Res. (JAIR), 2013.2. For the **Humanoid Locomotion**, the citation is: > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., and Zaremba, W. *OpenAI gym*. 2016.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
