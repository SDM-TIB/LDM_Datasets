To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Reactor: A Fast and Sample-Efficient Actor-Critic Agent for Reinforcement Learning" by Audrunas Gruslys et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **Atari 2600 benchmarks**, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation process. They mention using the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, which is a well-known dataset for reinforcement learning tasks. This is a strong indication that the ALE is the dataset used in their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they trained and evaluated their agent on **57 Atari 2600 games** from the ALE. This confirms that the ALE is the dataset used for their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). The citation is:- For the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, the citation is: > Marc G Bellemare, Will Dabney, and RAmi Munos. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. J. Artif. Intell. Res. (JAIR), 47:253a279, 2013.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the ALE.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the ALE, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
