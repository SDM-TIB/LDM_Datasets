To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Addressing Some Limitations of Transformers with Feedback Memory" by Angela Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed Feedback Transformer architecture and its performance on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention several datasets used for their experiments, including:1. **WMT14 En-De**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of pairs and the training and testing splits.2. **IWSLT De-En**: This dataset is another machine translation dataset used for evaluating the Feedback Transformer's performance. The authors mention the dataset's characteristics, such as the number of pairs and the training and testing configurations.3. **Char-PTB**: This dataset is used for language modeling tasks. The authors describe the dataset's structure and the specific tasks they performed on it.4. **Enwik8**: This dataset is utilized for language modeling tasks, and the authors provide details about its size and the training process.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about how they used these datasets, including the number of training and testing examples, the model architectures, and the evaluation metrics. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' roles in the research.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:- For **WMT14 En-De**, the citation is: > Sennrich, R., Haddow, B., & Birch, A.

URL: http://www.mattmahoney.net/text/text.htmlAfter gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
