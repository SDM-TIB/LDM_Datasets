To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advances in Experience Replay" by Hima Tammineedi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the combination of experience replay techniques and mentions testing in various OpenAI Gym environments, which suggests that datasets related to these environments may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methodology sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention testing their methods in "a variety of OpenAI gym environments," which indicates that these environments are likely datasets or benchmarks for their experiments. I will look for specific names of environments in the methodology section.In the **methodology section**, the authors explicitly list the environments used for testing their experience replay techniques. They mention the following environments:1. **CartPole-v0**: A classic reinforcement learning environment where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart.2. **MountainCar-v0**: A one-dimensional track where the agent must drive up a hill.3. **LunarLander-v2**: A two-dimensional environment where the goal is to land a spacecraft safely on a lunar surface.4. **Pendulum-v0**: A continuous action space environment where the goal is to keep a pendulum upright.I will also check the **results section** to confirm the environments used for evaluation and to see if any additional datasets are mentioned. The authors provide performance metrics for each environment, which reinforces their use in the experiments.Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the OpenAI Gym environments. The environments are part of the OpenAI Gym toolkit, which is a widely recognized benchmark in reinforcement learning. The citation for OpenAI Gym is:- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is: > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym: An entirely new approach to developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01570, 2016. https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01570After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the environments and the OpenAI Gym toolkit. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
