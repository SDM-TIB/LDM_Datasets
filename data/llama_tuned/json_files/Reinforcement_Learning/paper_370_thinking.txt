To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Episodic Backward Update: A Novel Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm" by Su Young Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed algorithm on various environments, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention two specific environments:1. **2D MNIST Maze Environment**: This dataset is used for training agents to navigate through a maze. The authors specify that they use the MNIST dataset for state representation, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.2. **49 Games of Atari 2600 Domain**: This dataset includes a collection of 49 Atari 2600 games, which is a well-known benchmark for reinforcement learning. The authors reference the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) for this dataset.The authors do not provide a specific citation for the MNIST dataset, as it is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning. However, I will note that the MNIST dataset is commonly referenced as:> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/For the Atari 2600 games, the citation is:> M. G. Bellemare, Y. Naddaf, J. Veness, and M. Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253-279, 2013.Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
