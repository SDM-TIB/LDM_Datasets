To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Quantile Regression" by Will Dabney et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the Atari 2600 games for evaluation, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, which is a well-known dataset for reinforcement learning tasks, specifically for evaluating Atari 2600 games. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their experiments.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). The citation is as follows:> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253a279, 2013.Since the paper primarily focuses on the Atari 2600 games, I will summarize the dataset as follows:1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: This dataset consists of 57 Atari 2600 games, which is a widely used benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
