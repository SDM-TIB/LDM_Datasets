To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Policy Inference Q-Network for Multi-Agent Systems" by Zhang-Wei Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a deep policy inference Q-network for multi-agent systems, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using a classic soccer game environment for their experiments. This indicates that there is a specific dataset or environment that is crucial for their evaluations.In the **experimental setup section**, the authors provide details about the soccer game environment, including the grid world structure and the rules governing the game. They mention that the game is played on a 6A9 grid world, which is a key dataset for their experiments.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the soccer game environment. The relevant citation is:- For the soccer game environment, the citation is: > Brian Collins. *Combining opponent modeling and model-based reinforcement learning in a two-player competitive game*. Master's thesis, School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, 2007.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the soccer game environment.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the soccer game environment, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
