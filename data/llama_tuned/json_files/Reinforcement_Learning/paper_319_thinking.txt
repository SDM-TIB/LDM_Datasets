To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Prioritized Experience Replay" by Dan Horgan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the **Arcade Learning Environment** and **DeepMind Control Suite**, indicating that these are likely datasets or benchmarks used in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluations. They mention using the **Arcade Learning Environment** for Atari games and the **DeepMind Control Suite** for continuous control tasks. This suggests that these are the datasets used for their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:1. **Arcade Learning Environment**: This is a well-known benchmark for reinforcement learning, containing a collection of Atari games.2. **DeepMind Control Suite**: This dataset is used for continuous control tasks, providing a set of environments for robotic control tasks.I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Arcade Learning Environment**, the citation is: > Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. J. Artif. Intell. Res. (JAIR), 47:253a279, 2013.- For the **DeepMind Control Suite**, the citation is: > Yuval Tassa, Yotam Doron, Alistair Muldal, Tom Erez, Yazhe Li, Diego de Las Casas, David Budden, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Josh Merel, Andrew Lefrancq, Timothy Lillicrap, and Martin Riedmiller. *DeepMind Control Suite*. 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
