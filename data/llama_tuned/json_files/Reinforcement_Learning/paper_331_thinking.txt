To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Do deep reinforcement learning agents model intentions?" by Tambet Matiisen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the investigation of deep reinforcement learning agents' ability to infer intentions, which suggests that datasets may be involved in their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors describe their experiments. They mention using a cooperative navigation task from a previous work by Lowe et al. (2017), which indicates that this is a dataset used in their research.I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methods section**. The authors describe the cooperative navigation task, which involves three agents covering three landmarks and coordinating their actions. They mention using the MADDPG algorithm and the specific parameters for training, but they do not provide a formal dataset name in this section.In the **results section**, the authors discuss their findings and the performance of their agents, but they do not introduce any new datasets. Instead, they refer to the previous work by Lowe et al. (2017) for the dataset used in their experiments.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset is:- For the cooperative navigation task, the citation is: > R. Lowe, Y. Wu, A. Tamar, J. Harb, O. P. Abbeel, and I. Mordatch. *Multi-agent actor-critic for mixed cooperative-competitive environments*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 6382a6393, 2017.Since the paper does not introduce any additional datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset used in the experiments.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the cooperative navigation task, ensuring that I include the necessary details and the full citation.
