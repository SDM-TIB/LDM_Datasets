To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parameter Space Noise for Exploration" by Matthias Plappert et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of deep reinforcement learning methods and mentions the evaluation of these methods on various environments, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention using the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)** and **OpenAI Gym** for their experiments. This indicates that these are the datasets I need to extract.In the **experiments section**, the authors specify that they used the ALE for discrete action environments and OpenAI Gym for continuous control tasks. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including any specific configurations or parameters used for training.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:1. For the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, the citation is: > Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253a279, 2013. doi:10.1613/jair.3912. URL http://dx.doi.org/10.1613/jair.3912.2. For the **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is: > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
