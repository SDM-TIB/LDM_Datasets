To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shallow Updates for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Nir Levinea et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the Atari benchmark for experiments, which suggests that datasets related to Atari games may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention using the **Atari benchmark**, which is a well-known dataset in reinforcement learning. I will look for specific games or environments mentioned in the experiments section.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they tested their method on **five Atari games**: Asterix, Space Invaders, Breakout, Qbert, and Bowling. This indicates that these games are part of the dataset used for their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the Atari games. The Atari games are part of the Atari Learning Environment (ALE), which is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning. The citation for the Atari Learning Environment is:- For the **Atari Learning Environment**, the citation is: > Bellemare, Marc G., Naddaf, Yavar, Veness, Joel, and Bowling, Michael. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253a279, 2013.Since the paper does not provide specific citations for the individual Atari games, I will use the citation for the Atari Learning Environment as it encompasses all the games mentioned. The citation is sufficient for the dataset as a whole.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the Atari Learning Environment, ensuring to include the full citation, as it is the authoritative source for the datasets used in the experiments.
