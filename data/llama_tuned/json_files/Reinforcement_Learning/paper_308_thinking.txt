To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STMARL: A Spatio-Temporal Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach for Cooperative Traffic Light Control" by Yanan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a novel approach for traffic light control, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of real-world traffic data.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention two datasets:1. **DHangzhou Dataset**: This dataset is described as a publicly available dataset for city Hangzhou, China, with a grid structure and a duration of one hour. It contains traffic flow data.2. **DHefei Dataset**: This dataset is collected from Hefei, China, consisting of four heterogeneous intersections. It includes information on vehicles and roads recorded by a camera, along with timestamps from November 6, 2018, to November 12, 2018. The dataset shows significant variations in traffic arrival rates.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **DHangzhou Dataset**, the citation is: > CityLab. *Traffic Mind-Boggling 2018*. Available: https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/02/traffic-mind-boggling-economic-toll/552488/economictoll,- For the **DHefei Dataset**, the citation is: > Hefei Traffic Light Control Dataset. *Traffic Light Control Dataset*. Available: http://cityflow-project.github.io/After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
