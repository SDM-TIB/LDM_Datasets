To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Scheduling Algorithms for Data Processing Clusters" by Hongzi Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of reinforcement learning and neural networks for scheduling, which suggests that datasets related to workload and job execution might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention using a **production cluster dataset** from Alibaba, which is crucial for their experiments. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its size, structure, and how it was utilized in their evaluations.In the **evaluation section**, the authors state that they integrated their method with Spark and evaluated it on a workload trace from Alibaba's production clusters. This indicates that the dataset is significant for their experiments, but I need to find the exact name and details of the dataset.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Alibaba production cluster dataset. The relevant citation is:> Alibaba. *Cluster data collected from production clusters in Alibaba for cluster management research*. GitHub, 2017. https://github.com/alibaba/clusterdata.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and citation in a structured format for clarity and completeness. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset used in the research paper.
