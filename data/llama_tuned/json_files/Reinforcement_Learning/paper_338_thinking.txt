To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autonomous Braking System via Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Hyunmin Chae et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of an autonomous braking system based on deep reinforcement learning, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their model. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Euro NCAP AEB Pedestrian Test** for evaluating their autonomous braking system. This indicates that a specific dataset is being utilized.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Euro NCAP AEB Pedestrian Test. The relevant citation is:- For the **Euro NCAP AEB Pedestrian Test**, the citation is: > European New Car Assessment Programme. *Pedestrian testing protocol*. European New Car Assessment Programme, Dec. 2016.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the Euro NCAP AEB Pedestrian Test.After completing this process, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Euro NCAP AEB Pedestrian Test, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
