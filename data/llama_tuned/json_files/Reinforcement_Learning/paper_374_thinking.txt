To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LADDER: A Human-Level Bidding Agent for Large-Scale Real-Time Online Auctions" by Yu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the LADDER agent in real-time online auctions, which suggests that datasets related to online advertising or bidding may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction discusses the challenges of real-world problems and the need for a deep reinforcement learning agent, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.In the **methods section**, I will look for any datasets that are used for training or testing the LADDER agent. The authors describe the bidding mechanism and the use of a deep asynchronous stochastic Q-learning algorithm, but they do not specify any datasets here either.I will then examine the **experiments section** to see if the authors provide any details about the datasets used for evaluation. They mention conducting online A/B tests and evaluating the performance of the LADDER agent, but again, no specific datasets are named.After reviewing the **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets in the context of the experiments. The authors discuss the performance of the LADDER agent but do not provide specific dataset names or citations.Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide any dataset entries or citations.Finally, I will compile my findings, noting that the paper does not provide any datasets for extraction.
