To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Distributional Deterministic Policy Gradient" by Gabriel Barth-Maron et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the D4PG algorithm and its performance on various control tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the use of a "suite of benchmark tasks" developed in the MuJoCo physics simulator, which indicates that this is a dataset or a collection of tasks. In the **experiments section**, they describe the control tasks and mention specific tasks like "dexterous manipulation tasks" and "parkour tasks," which are likely derived from the MuJoCo environment.In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for various tasks, confirming that these tasks are part of the dataset used for evaluation. I will also check the **appendices** for more detailed descriptions of the tasks and any additional datasets mentioned.In the **appendices**, I find that the authors reference the "MuJoCo physics simulator" and the "Control Suite" developed by Yuval Tassa et al. This is a key dataset that includes various control tasks, such as "Acrobot," "Cartpole," and "Cheetah."The authors also mention the "Manipulator" and "Parkour" tasks, which are part of the same dataset.Now, I will look for the full citation of the MuJoCo physics simulator and the Control Suite in the **References section**. The citation for the MuJoCo physics simulator is:- For **MuJoCo**, the citation is: > Yuval Tassa, Yotam Doron, Alistair Muldal, Tom Erez, Yazhe Li, Diego de Las Casas, David Budden, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Josh Merel, Andrew Lefrancq, Timothy Lillicrap, and Martin Riedmiller. *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690, 2018. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00690.The citation for the Control Suite is the same as the MuJoCo physics simulator, as it is part of the same work:- For **Control Suite**, the citation is the same as above: > Yuval Tassa, Yotam Doron, Alistair Muldal, Tom Erez, Yazhe Li, Diego de Las Casas, David Budden, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Josh Merel, Andrew Lefrancq, Timothy Lillicrap, and Martin Riedmiller. *DeepMind Control Suite*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.00690, 2018. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00690.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both the MuJoCo physics simulator and the Control Suite. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
