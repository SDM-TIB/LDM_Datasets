To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Run with Actor-Critic Ensemble" by Zhewei Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the Actor-Critic Ensemble method for improving the performance of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **experiments section** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for training or evaluation.Next, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe their experiments and the methods used, but they do not explicitly name any datasets. However, they do reference the **NIPS a17 Learning to Run competition**, which suggests that there may be a dataset associated with this competition.In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they won the 2nd place in the NIPS a17 Learning to Run competition, but they do not provide a specific dataset name. Instead, they refer to the competition itself as the source of their data. This indicates that the dataset is derived from the competition rather than a traditional dataset with a fixed name.Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or details, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the NIPS a17 Learning to Run competition. The authors reference the competition but do not provide a specific dataset citation.The paper does not provide any additional datasets or references to datasets in the **methodology or results sections**. Therefore, I will conclude that the dataset used is the one derived from the NIPS a17 Learning to Run competition, but I will note that it does not have a formal dataset name or citation.Since the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will summarize the findings as follows:1. **NIPS a17 Learning to Run competition**: This is the dataset derived from the competition, but it does not have a formal citation in the paper.Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format, noting that while the paper references a competition, it does not provide a specific dataset name or citation.
