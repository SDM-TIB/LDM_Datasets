To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging the Gap Between Value and Policy Based Reinforcement Learning" by Oir Nachum et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a new reinforcement learning algorithm but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more detailed information.Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this paper, the authors mention using the **OpenAI Gym library** for their experiments. This indicates that the datasets are likely derived from the environments and tasks defined within this library.I will look for specific datasets or environments mentioned in the experiments. The paper states that they evaluated their algorithms on "algorithmic tasks from the OpenAI Gym library," which suggests that the datasets are part of this library. The tasks mentioned include "Copy," "DuplicatedInput," "RepeatCopy," "Reverse," "ReversedAddition," and "ReversedAddition3." These tasks are part of the OpenAI Gym environments, which are commonly used for reinforcement learning experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenAI Gym library, as it is the source of the datasets used in the experiments. The citation for the OpenAI Gym library is:- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is: > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv:1606.01540.With this information, I can now summarize the datasets used in the paper:1. **Synthetic Tree Environment**: This is a custom environment developed for testing the proposed algorithms. It is not a publicly available dataset but rather a synthetic environment created for the experiments.2. **Algorithmic Tasks from OpenAI Gym**: The paper uses various tasks from the OpenAI Gym library, including "Copy," "DuplicatedInput," "RepeatCopy," "Reverse," "ReversedAddition," and "ReversedAddition3." These tasks are part of the OpenAI Gym library and do not have a separate dataset citation since they are environments rather than datasets.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym library, as it is the source of the datasets used in the experiments.
