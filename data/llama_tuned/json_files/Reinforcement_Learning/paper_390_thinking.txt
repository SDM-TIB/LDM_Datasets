To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive coordination of working-memory and reinforcement learning in non-human primates performing a trial-and-error problem solving task" by Guillaume Viejo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of computational models and mentions a problem-solving task, which suggests that datasets related to this task may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that describe the experimental setup and data collection. In this paper, the authors describe a trial-and-error problem-solving task involving five monkeys. They mention that the task consists of a search phase and a repetition phase, but they do not explicitly name any datasets. However, they refer to previous studies that utilized similar tasks, which may indicate the datasets used.In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models and compare them to previous studies, but again, they do not explicitly mention any datasets. Instead, they reference other studies that used similar tasks, such as the work by Khamassi et al. (2015) and the study by Procyk et al. (2006). These references may lead to the identification of datasets used in those studies.Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or details, I will check the **references section** to find any datasets or studies that the authors cite. The relevant references include:- For the study by Khamassi et al. (2015), the citation is: > M. Khamassi, R. Quilodran, P. Enel, P. Dominey, E. Procyk, *Behavioral regulation and the modulation of information coding in the lateral prefrontal and cingulate cortex*. Cereb Cortex, 2015.- For the study by Procyk et al. (2006), the citation is: > E. Procyk, P. S. Goldman-Rakic, *Modulation of dorsolateral prefrontal delay activity during self-organized behavior*. The Journal of Neuroscience, 26(15):11313a11323, 2006.Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:1. **Trial-and-error Problem Solving Task**: This task involves five monkeys trained to find a correct target among four options. The authors do not provide a specific dataset name, but they reference previous studies that utilized this task.2. **Previous Studies**: The authors cite two studies that used similar tasks:1. **Khamassi et al. (2015)**: This study analyzed behavioral data from five monkeys performing a trial-and-error problem-solving task.2. **Procyk et al. (2006)**: This study examined the modulation of dorsolateral prefrontal delay activity during self-organized behavior in monkeys.Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset name for the trial-and-error task, I will focus on the references for the cited studies. The datasets associated with these studies are not explicitly named in the paper, but they are referenced in the context of the experiments.Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the referenced studies. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets used in the research, even if they are not explicitly named in the paper itself.
