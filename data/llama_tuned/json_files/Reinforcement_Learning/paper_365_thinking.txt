To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning based QoS/QoE-aware Service Function Chaining in Software-Driven 5G Slices" by Xi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the implementation of a reinforcement learning framework for service function chaining in 5G slices, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their methods. In this paper, the authors mention two experiments: one involving a video streaming application and another involving a simulation with various VNF instances. I will look for specific dataset names or descriptions in these sections.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments:1. **QoS over LLDP Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) protocol, which is used to collect QoS information from network devices. The authors mention that they implemented a QoS information collector based on LLDP to evaluate the impact of QoS over LLDP on network traffic.2. **DQN-based QoS/QoE-aware SFC Algorithm Dataset**: This dataset is generated through a TensorFlow simulation, where the authors compare their algorithm's performance against random search and violent search methods. The dataset includes various VNF instances and QoS metrics, which are used to evaluate the performance of their reinforcement learning model.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **QoS over LLDP Dataset**, the citation is: > Cisco. *LLDP-MED and Cisco Discovery Protocol*. Cisco White Papers, 2006.- For the **DQN-based QoS/QoE-aware SFC Algorithm Dataset**, the citation is: > Pfai Ben, Pettit Justin, Koponen Teemu, et al. *The design and implementation of Open vSwitch*. In: 12th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI), vol. 40: :117a130; 2015.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
