To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Surrogate Agent-Environment Interface" by Song Wangsong, Yu Jing, and Wayne State University, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of a surrogate agent-environment interface and mentions experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe their testing of the PSADPG algorithm on two specific tasks: **Acrobot-v1** and **Amidar-v0**. These tasks are part of the OpenAI Gym, which is a well-known platform for reinforcement learning. This indicates that the datasets used for these experiments are part of the OpenAI Gym.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets or environments used. The OpenAI Gym is referenced, and I will look for the specific environments mentioned in the paper, which are **Acrobot-v1** and **Amidar-v0**. The citation for the OpenAI Gym is as follows:> Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the OpenAI Gym, as it is the primary source for the datasets used in the experiments.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.
