To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stabilizing Transformers for Reinforcement Learning" by Emilio Parisotto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of transformers in reinforcement learning and mentions the DMLab-30 benchmark suite, indicating that this is a dataset of interest.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluations. They explicitly mention using the **DMLab-30 benchmark suite** for their experiments, which is a strong indication that this is a dataset used in their research.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the DMLab-30 benchmark suite, including its structure and the tasks it supports. They also mention using V-MPO for training, which is a reinforcement learning algorithm, but the focus remains on the dataset itself.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the DMLab-30 benchmark suite. The citation is as follows:> Charles Beattie, Joel Z Leibo, Denis Teplyashin, Tom Ward, Marcus Wainwright, Heinrich K A uttler, Andrew Lefrancq, Simon Green, V A Actor Valdes, Amir Sadik, et al. *DeepMind Lab*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1612.03801, 2016.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. The dataset entry will include the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
