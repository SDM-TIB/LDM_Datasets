To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Policy Update for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Quan Vuong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed method and mentions experiments conducted on various environments, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **Mujoco simulated robotic tasks** and **Atari video game tasks**. This indicates that these are the datasets used for their experiments.I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For **Mujoco**, the citation is: > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. 2012. URL https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6386109/authors2. For **Atari**, the citation is: > Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. CoRR, abs/1207.4708, 2012. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4708.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
