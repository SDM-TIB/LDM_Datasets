To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Actor-Critic with Experience Replay for Sample Efficient Actor-Critic" by Ziyu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of experience replay in deep reinforcement learning, which suggests that datasets related to reinforcement learning may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the use of the **Arcade Learning Environment** for evaluating their method, which indicates that this is a dataset or environment used in their experiments. I will look for more details about this environment in the **experiments section**.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **Arcade Learning Environment** for their Atari domain experiments. They also mention using the **MuJoCo physics engine** for continuous control tasks. This is a significant dataset for their continuous control experiments.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **Arcade Learning Environment**, the citation is: > M. G. Bellemare, Y. Naddaf, J. Veness, and M. Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. JAIR, 47:253a279, 2013.2. For the **MuJoCo physics engine**, the citation is: > E. Todorov, T. Erez, and Y. Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pages 5026a5033, 2012.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
