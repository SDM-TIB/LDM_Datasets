To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Transferable Architectures for Scalable Image Recognition" by Barret Zoph et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the CIFAR-10 dataset for training models, which indicates that this dataset is likely to be one of the datasets used.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and results. In this section, they explicitly mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for training and evaluating their models. They describe the dataset as consisting of 60,000 32x32 RGB images across 10 classes, which is crucial information for my extraction.In the **experiments section**, the authors also refer to the **ImageNet dataset** for evaluating their models. They mention that ImageNet consists of 1.2 million images labeled across 1,000 classes, which is a significant dataset for image classification tasks.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.2. For **ImageNet**, the citation is: > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
