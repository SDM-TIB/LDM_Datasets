To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer-Based Acoustic Modeling for Hybrid Speech Recognition" by Yongqiang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **Librispeech benchmark**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation process. They mention using the **Librispeech corpus** for training and testing their models. This is a significant dataset for speech recognition tasks.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the **Librispeech corpus**, stating that it contains approximately 960 hours of read speech data, divided into development and test sets. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Librispeech corpus**. The citation is as follows:> V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of ICASSP, 2015, pp. 5206a5210.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the only dataset extracted from this paper is the **Librispeech corpus**. I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
