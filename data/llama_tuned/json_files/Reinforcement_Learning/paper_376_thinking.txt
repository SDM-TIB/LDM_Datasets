To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Explanations Without Opening the Black Box: Automated Decisions and the GDPR" by Sandra Wachter, Brent Mittelstadt, and Chris Russell, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of counterfactual explanations in the context of automated decision-making, which suggests that datasets may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the need for explanations in automated decision-making, but I need to look for specific datasets used for evaluation or testing their methods.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their approach to generating counterfactuals on two datasets:1. **LSAT Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict students' first-year average grades based on their race, grade-point average prior to law school, and law school entrance exam scores. The authors mention that this dataset is used to demonstrate bias against black students.2. **Pima Diabetes Database**: This dataset is used to predict whether women of Pima heritage are at risk of diabetes based on various demographic and health-related factors.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **LSAT Dataset**, the citation is: > R. Darrell Bock & Marcus Lieberman. *Fitting a Response Model for n Dichotomously Scored Items*. Psychometrika, 35(3), 187-196, 1970.- For the **Pima Diabetes Database**, the citation is: > Jack W. Smith et al. *Using the ADAP Learning Algorithm to Forecast the Onset of Diabetes Mellitus*. Proceedings of the Annual Symposium on Computational Applications in Medical Care, 261-262, 1988.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
