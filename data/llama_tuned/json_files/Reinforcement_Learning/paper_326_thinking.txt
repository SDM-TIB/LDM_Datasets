To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural Gradient Deep Q-learning" by Ethan Knight et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of natural-gradient techniques for deep Q-learning, which suggests that datasets related to reinforcement learning may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention using the **OpenAI Gym platform**, which provides several classic control environments. This indicates that the datasets are likely to be related to these environments.In the **experiments section**, the authors specify the environments they tested their methods on, which are:1. **CartPole-v0**: A classic control task where the agent balances a pole on a cart.2. **CartPole-v1**: An extension of CartPole-v0 that requires the agent to balance the pole for a longer duration.3. **Acrobot-v1**: The agent swings a double-jointed pendulum up from a stationary position.4. **LunarLander-v2**: The agent attempts to land a lander on a specific location in a simulated 2D world.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these environments. The OpenAI Gym platform is referenced, which is a collection of environments for reinforcement learning. The citations for the environments are as follows:- For **CartPole-v0**, the citation is: > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. ArXiv e-prints, abs/1606.01540, 2016. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540.- For **CartPole-v1**, the citation is the same as above since it is an extension of CartPole-v0.- For **Acrobot-v1**, the citation is the same as above.- For **LunarLander-v2**, the citation is the same as above.Since the environments are part of the OpenAI Gym platform, I will use the same citation for all of them.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each environment as they are part of the same reference. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
