To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Teaching a Machine to Read Maps with Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Gino Brunner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a reinforcement learning agent to navigate mazes, which suggests that datasets related to maze environments might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention using the **DeepMind Lab environment** for training and testing their agent. This indicates that a specific dataset or environment is being utilized.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the training and testing setup, stating that they created a training set of 100 mazes and a test set of 900 mazes. They also mention the **DeepMind Lab environment** as the source of these mazes. This is a crucial detail as it provides the name of the dataset or environment used for training and testing.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **DeepMind Lab environment**. The relevant citation is:- For **DeepMind Lab**, the citation is: > Beattie, C., Leibo, J. Z., Teplyashin, D., Ward, T., Wainwright, M., Kauttler, H., Lefrancq, A., Green, S., Valdes, V., Sadik, A., Schrittwieser, J., Anderson, K., York, S., Cant, M., Cain, A., Bolton, A., Gaffney, S., King, H., Hassabis, D., Legg, S., and Petersen, S. *DeepMind Lab*. CoRR abs/1612.03801, 2016.With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:1. **DeepMind Lab Environment**: This is the dataset used for training and testing the reinforcement learning agent. It consists of 100 training mazes and 900 test mazes, with specific sizes mentioned (5x5, 7x7, 9x9, 11x11, 13x13, 15x15, 17x17, 19x19, and 21x21).The citation for the DeepMind Lab environment is as follows:- DeepMind Lab. *DeepMind Lab*. CoRR abs/1612.03801, 2016.Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I include the full citation for the DeepMind Lab environment as it is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper.
