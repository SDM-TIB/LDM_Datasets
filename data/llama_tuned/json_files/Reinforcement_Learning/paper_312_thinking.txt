To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving NP-Hard Problems on Graphs with Extended AlphaGo Zero" by Kenshin Abe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of reinforcement learning and graph embeddings, which suggests that datasets related to graphs might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention generating various types of graphs, including Erdős-Renyi graphs, Barabási-Albert graphs, and real-world graphs from the Network Repository. This indicates that datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors specify that they generated Erdős-Renyi graphs of different sizes and used 10 real-world graphs from the Network Repository. This is a clear indication of the datasets used.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The Erdős-Renyi graphs are a well-known dataset in graph theory, and the real-world graphs are sourced from the Network Repository. The citations for these datasets are as follows:- For **Erdős-Renyi graphs**, the citation is: > Paul Erdős. *On random graphs*. Publicationes mathematicae, 6:290a297, 1959.- For the **Barabási-Albert model**, the citation is: > Barabási and Albert. *Emergence of scaling in random networks*. Science, 286 5439:509a12, 1999.- For the **real-world graphs**, the citation is: > Ryan A. Rossi and Nesreen Ahmed. *The network data repository with interactive graph analytics and visualization*. In Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, 2015.Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
