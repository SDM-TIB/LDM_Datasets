To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable trust-region method for deep reinforcement learning using Kronecker-factored approximation" by Yuhuai Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method on Atari games and the MuJoCo environment, which suggests that these are the datasets used.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation. They mention using the **Atari games** and the **MuJoCo environments** for their experiments. This is a strong indication that these are the datasets used.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:1. **Atari Games**: The authors tested their method on six standard Atari 2600 games, which are commonly used in reinforcement learning benchmarks.2. **MuJoCo Environments**: They also evaluated their method on a variety of continuous control tasks defined in OpenAI Gym, simulated by the MuJoCo physics engine.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Atari Games**, the citation is: > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: A benchmark for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.- For the **MuJoCo Environments**, the citation is: > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control. In *IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems*, 1-8.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
