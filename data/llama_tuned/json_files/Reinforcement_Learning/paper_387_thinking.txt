To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiagent Soft Q-Learning" by Ermo Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges in multiagent reinforcement learning and introduces the proposed method, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on the **Max of Two Quadratics game**, which is a continuous game for 2 agents. This indicates that a dataset or a specific game environment is being used for evaluation.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Max of Two Quadratics game. The relevant citation is:- For the **Max of Two Quadratics game**, the citation is: > Panait, L., Luke, S., & Wiegand, R. P. (2006). Biasing co-evolutionary search for optimal multiagent behaviors. *IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation*, 10(6), 629-645.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and citation, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent analysis or application of the findings.
