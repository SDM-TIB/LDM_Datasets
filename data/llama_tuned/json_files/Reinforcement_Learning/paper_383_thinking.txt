To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Intentional Unintentional Agent: Learning to Solve Many Continuous Control Tasks" by Serkan Cabi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of an agent that can learn multiple tasks simultaneously, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**. Here, the authors describe the physical environment they created using the **MuJoCo physics engine**. This indicates that the MuJoCo engine is a dataset or a simulation environment used for their experiments.I will also look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **results section** or **discussion**. The authors describe the tasks they implemented in the playroom environment, which suggests that the playroom environment itself is a dataset or a simulation environment used for their experiments.In the **references section**, I will check for any citations related to the MuJoCo physics engine or any other datasets that may have been used. The citation for the MuJoCo physics engine is:> E. Todorov, T. Erez, and Y. Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2012.Since the paper primarily focuses on the MuJoCo environment and does not mention any other specific datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the MuJoCo physics engine.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MuJoCo physics engine, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
