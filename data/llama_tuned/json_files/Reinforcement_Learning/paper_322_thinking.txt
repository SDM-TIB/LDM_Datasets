To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Randomized Value Functions via Multiplicative Normalizing Flows" by Ahmed Touati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of randomized value functions for exploration in complex environments, which suggests that datasets related to reinforcement learning may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention evaluating their method on several environments, including the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)** and **OpenAI Gym**. This indicates that these environments are likely datasets or benchmarks for their experiments.I will also check the **related work section** to see if any other datasets are referenced. The authors mention using Atari games from the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, which is a well-known dataset in reinforcement learning. Additionally, they reference the **OpenAI Gym** for continuous control tasks, which is another dataset used in their experiments.Now, I will look at the **experiments section** in detail. The authors describe their evaluations in the **n-chain** and **Mountain Car** environments, which are toy domains for reinforcement learning. They also mention using Atari games from the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)** and continuous control tasks from **OpenAI Gym**. This confirms that these environments are datasets or benchmarks for their experiments.In the **related work section**, I will check for any additional datasets or references that may have been used. The authors cite the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)** and **OpenAI Gym** as sources for their experiments, which are crucial for dataset identification.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned:1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: The citation is: > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. (2013). *The Arcade Learning Environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 51, 1-28.2. **OpenAI Gym**: The citation is: > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., and Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
