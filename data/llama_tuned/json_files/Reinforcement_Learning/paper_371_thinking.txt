To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Environments" by Ryan Lowe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of multi-agent reinforcement learning methods, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of environments for testing the proposed algorithms.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the environments used for their evaluations. Here, they mention several environments, including:1. **Grounded Communication Environment**: This environment is specifically designed for multi-agent communication tasks, where agents must learn to communicate effectively to achieve a common goal.2. **Cooperative Navigation**: This environment requires agents to work together to reach a set of landmarks, demonstrating cooperative behavior.3. **Predator-Prey**: A classic multi-agent environment where one group of agents must chase another, showcasing competitive dynamics.4. **Covert Communication**: An adversarial environment where agents must communicate in a way that is difficult for an adversary to intercept.5. **Keep-Away**: A competitive environment where agents must keep each other away from a target landmark.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the environments, including the number of agents (N) and landmarks (L), which are crucial for understanding the datasets used. However, they do not provide specific dataset names, as these environments are custom-made for their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the environments are based on existing datasets or if they reference any datasets that are commonly used in reinforcement learning. The authors cite several foundational works, but they do not provide specific dataset names or citations for the environments they created.Next, I will summarize the datasets based on the environments described:1. **Grounded Communication Environment**: No specific dataset citation is provided, as it is a custom environment.2. **Cooperative Navigation**: No specific dataset citation is provided, as it is a custom environment.3. **Predator-Prey**: No specific dataset citation is provided, as it is a custom environment.4. **Covert Communication**: No specific dataset citation is provided, as it is a custom environment.5. **Keep-Away**: No specific dataset citation is provided, as it is a custom environment.Since the environments are custom-made and do not reference external datasets, I will note that while the paper does not provide specific dataset names, it outlines the environments used for evaluation.Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate that the datasets are custom environments rather than publicly available datasets with citations. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets used in the research without referencing external datasets.
