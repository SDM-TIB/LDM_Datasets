To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vulnerability of Deep Reinforcement Learning to Policy Induction Attacks" by Vahid Behzadan and Arslan Munir, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the vulnerability of Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) to adversarial examples, which suggests that datasets related to reinforcement learning might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** where the authors describe their experiments. They mention training their DQN on a game of **Pong** implemented in Python using the PyGame library. This indicates that the dataset is derived from a specific game environment.In the **experimental verification section**, the authors specify that they used the **Atari 2600 game** for training their DQN. This is a well-known dataset in the field of reinforcement learning, as it is commonly used for training and evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Atari 2600 dataset. The relevant citation is:- For **Atari 2600 games**, the citation is: > V. Mnih, K. Kavukcuoglu, D. Silver, A. Graves, I. Antonoglou, D. Wierstra, and M. Riedmiller. *Playing atari with deep reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.5602, 2013.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Atari 2600 dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Atari 2600 dataset, ensuring that it is clear and ready for further processing or review.
