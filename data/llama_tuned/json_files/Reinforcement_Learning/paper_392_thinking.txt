To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rapid Probabilistic Interest Learning from Domain-Specific Pairwise Image Comparisons" by Michael Burke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of pairwise image comparisons for image interest estimation, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **datasets section** (section IV) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for testing their approach. Here, they mention five datasets:1. **OASIS**: A small publically available medical imaging dataset containing 416 averaged and co-registered T1-weighted cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging scans of patients with varying levels of dementia.2. **Violence**: A publically available dataset of over 10,000 protest images with accompanying measures of the perceived violence depicted therein.3. **CSIR**: A dataset comprising 4,000 outdoor images captured by an autonomous rover, with 15,000 baseline pairwise image comparison results obtained using a labeling interface.4. **Coastcam**: A dataset consisting of almost 2,000 outdoor images of the Fishhoek coastline in South Africa, captured from a static camera, with 10,000 baseline pairwise image comparison results obtained from a domain expert.5. **Place Pulse 2.0**: A dataset containing 110,988 Google Streetview images taken from 56 cities, with over 1 million baseline pairwise image comparisons made publically available for six perceptual attributes.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:- For **OASIS**, the citation is: > Daniel S Marcus, Tracy H Wang, Jamie Parker, John G Csernansky, John C Morris, and Randy L Buckner. *Open access series of imaging studies (OASIS): cross-sectional MRI data in young, middle-aged, nondemented, and dementiaed older adults*. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 19(9):1498a1507, 2007.- For **Violence**, the citation is: > Donghyeon Won, Zachary C Steinert-Threlkeld, and Jungseock Joo. *Protest activity detection and perceived violence estimation from social media images*. In Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Multimedia Conference, pages 786a794, 2017.- For **CSIR**, the citation is: > M. Burke. *Image ranking in video sequences using pairwise image comparisons and temporal smoothing*. In 2016 Pattern Recognition Association of South Africa and Robotics and Mechatronics International Conference (PRASA-RobMech), pages 1a6, Nov 2016. doi:10.1109/RoboMech.2016.7813166.- For **Coastcam**, the citation is: > M. Burke. *Image ranking in video sequences using pairwise image comparisons and temporal smoothing*. In 2016 Pattern Recognition Association of South Africa and Robotics and Mechatronics International Conference (PRASA-RobMech), pages 1a6, Nov 2016. doi:10.1109/RoboMech.2016.7813166.- For **Place Pulse 2.0**, the citation is: > Abhimanyu Dubey, Nikhil Naik, Devi Parikh, Ramesh Raskar, and CÃ©sar A Hidalgo. *Deep learning the city: Quantifying urban perception at a global scale*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 196a212, Springer, 2016.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
