To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IA-GCN: Interpretable Attention based Graph Convolutional Network for Disease prediction" by Anees Kazi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their method to two publicly available datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they refer to two datasets:1. **Tadpole Dataset**: This dataset is used for Alzheimer's disease prediction, containing 564 patients classified into three categories (Normal, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer's). The dataset includes various multi-modal features such as cognitive tests, MRI ROIs, PET imaging, and others.2. **UK Biobank Dataset**: This dataset consists of 14,503 patients with 440 features extracted from MRI and fMRI images, used for gender and age prediction tasks.I will then check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Tadpole Dataset**, the citation is: > Marinescu, R., Oxtoby, N., Young, A., Bron, E., Toga, A., Weiner, M., Barkhof, F., Fox, N., Klein, S. *Tadpole challenge: Prediction of longitudinal evolution in Alzheimer's disease*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.03909, 2018.- For the **UK Biobank Dataset**, the citation is: > Miller, K. L., Alfaro-Almagro, F., Bangerter, N. K., Thomas, D. L., Yacoub, E., Xu, J., Bartsch, A. J., Jbabdi, S., Sotiropoulos, S. N., Andersson, J. L., et al. *Multimodal population brain imaging in the UK Biobank prospective epidemiological study*. Nature neuroscience, 19(11), 1523, 2016.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
