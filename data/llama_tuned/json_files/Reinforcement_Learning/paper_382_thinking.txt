To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Q-learning from Demonstrations" by Todd Hester et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of demonstration data for reinforcement learning, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe their evaluation methods. They mention using the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, which is a well-known benchmark for reinforcement learning. This indicates that ALE is a dataset or environment used in their experiments.In the **experimental setup**, the authors specify that they evaluated their algorithm on a randomly selected subset of 42 Atari games. This confirms that the ALE is indeed a dataset or environment used in their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). The citation is:- For **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, the citation is: > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Vemess, J., and Bowling, M. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR) 47:253a279, 2013.Since the ALE is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details.
