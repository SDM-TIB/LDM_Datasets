To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Episodic Memory Deep Q-Networks" by Zichuan Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)** for evaluating the proposed method, which suggests that this is a dataset or environment used in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation process. They mention using the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)** for testing their algorithm. This indicates that ALE is a dataset or environment used in their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors specify that they evaluate their algorithm on the **benchmark suite of 57 Atari 2600 games** from the ALE. This confirms that ALE is indeed a dataset or environment used in their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). The citation is:- For **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, the citation is: > M. G. Bellemare, Y. Naddaf, J. Vienne, and M. Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. In Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pages 1-9, 2013.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) as it is the only dataset mentioned in the paper.
