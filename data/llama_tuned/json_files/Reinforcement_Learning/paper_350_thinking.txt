To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DARLA: Improving Zero-Shot Transfer in Reinforcement Learning" by Irina Higgins et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a multi-stage RL agent, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections** for more detailed information.In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of various environments and algorithms but do not specify any datasets. I will proceed to the **methods section** where they describe the experiments conducted.Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments using **DeepMind Lab** and **MuJoCo** environments. They mention that they used frames from these environments for training and testing their model, but they do not provide specific dataset names or citations.In the **experiments section**, the authors detail the tasks they performed in **DeepMind Lab** and **Jaco arm** environments. They describe the setup and the tasks but do not provide specific dataset names or citations. However, they do reference the **DeepMind Lab** and **MuJoCo** environments as the basis for their experiments.Now, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the environments mentioned. The citations for the environments are as follows:- For **DeepMind Lab**, the citation is: > Beattie, C., Leibo, J. Z., Teplyashin, D., Ward, T., & Wainwright, M. W. (2016). *DeepMind Lab*. arXiv, 2016.- For **MuJoCo**, the citation is: > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2012.Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations for the tasks performed, I will summarize the environments used as follows:1. **DeepMind Lab**: A 3D game environment with rich visuals and realistic physics.2. **MuJoCo**: A physics engine for model-based control, used for simulating robotic arms and environments.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the environments as they are crucial for proper attribution. This will provide a clear and structured output for further processing or review.
