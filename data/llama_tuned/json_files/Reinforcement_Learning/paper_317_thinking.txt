To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Search through A3C Reinforcement Learning based Conversational Agent" by Milan Aggarwala et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a reinforcement learning-based conversational search agent, which suggests that datasets may be involved in training or evaluation.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using **query and session log data** from a major stock photography and digital asset marketplace. This indicates that there is a specific dataset related to user interactions with the search engine.I will also check the **methodology or training section** to see if the authors provide more details about the dataset, such as its size, structure, or any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they used query and session log data from approximately 20 days, which is a significant dataset for their experiments. However, they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset, which is common in research papers where datasets may not have a formal citation or may be proprietary.Now, I will look for any references to the dataset in the **references section** to see if there is a corresponding citation. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset used in their experiments. Since the dataset is derived from a stock photography and digital asset marketplace, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset without a formal citation.Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, I will summarize the dataset as follows:- **Dataset Name**: Query and Session Log Data from Stock Photography and Digital Asset Marketplace- **Description**: This dataset contains user interactions with the search engine, including queries, clicks, and other interactions, used to simulate user behavior for training the reinforcement learning agent.- **Citation**: Not available (proprietary dataset).After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the description and the note about the lack of a formal citation. This will provide a clear overview of the dataset used in the research without relying on external citations.
