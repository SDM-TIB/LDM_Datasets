To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IMPALA: Scalable Distributed Deep-RL with Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architectures" by Lasse Espeholt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on two environments: **DMLab-30** and **Atari-57**. This suggests that these are the datasets used in their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology. They mention using **DMLab-30** for multi-task reinforcement learning and **Atari-57** for training agents on Atari games. This confirms that these are the datasets used in their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets:1. **DMLab-30**: This dataset consists of 30 diverse cognitive tasks in the 3D DeepMind Lab environment. It is used for multi-task reinforcement learning.2. **Atari-57**: This dataset includes all available Atari games in the Arcade Learning Environment, which is used for training agents on various Atari games.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **DMLab-30**, the citation is: > Beattie, C., Leibo, J. Z., Teplyashin, D., Ward, T., Wainwright, M., Kuttler, H., Lefrancq, A., Green, S., Valdes, V., Sadik, A., Schrittwieser, J., Anderson, K., York, S., Cant, M., Cain, A., Bolton, A., Gaffney, S., King, H., Hassabis, D., Legg, S., and Petersen, S. *DeepMind Lab*. CoRR, abs/1612.03801, 2016.- For **Atari-57**, the citation is: > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253a279, June 2013.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
