To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Adaptive Clipping Approach for Proximal Policy Optimization" by Gang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, empirical analysis, and conclusions sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed algorithm on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **empirical analysis section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention using the **OpenAI Gym** for Atari game playing tasks and the **PyBullet** for benchmark control tasks. This indicates that these are the datasets I need to extract.In the **empirical analysis section**, the authors explicitly state that they used the following datasets:1. **OpenAI Gym**: This is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It provides a variety of environments for testing reinforcement learning algorithms, including Atari games and control tasks.2. **PyBullet**: This is a Python module for physics simulation that includes a robotics environment for benchmarking reinforcement learning algorithms. It is used for control tasks.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is: > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv, June 2016.- For **PyBullet**, the citation is: > Coumans, E., & Bai, Y. (2018). *PyBullet, a python module for physics simulation for games, robotics and machine learning*. http://pybullet.org, 2018.With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
