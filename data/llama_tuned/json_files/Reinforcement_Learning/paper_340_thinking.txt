To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Averaged-DQN: Variance Reduction and Stabilization for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Oron Anschel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the Averaged-DQN algorithm and its performance on various Atari games, which suggests that datasets related to these games may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)** for their experiments. This is a well-known benchmark for reinforcement learning, which indicates that it is a dataset used in their research.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their algorithm on three Atari games from the ALE, specifically mentioning **Breakout**, **SeaQuest**, and **Asterix**. This confirms that these games are part of the dataset used for their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). The citation is as follows:> Marc G. Bellemare, Y. Naddaf, J. Veness, and M. Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253a279, 2013.Since the ALE is a well-established benchmark, I will also note that it is a widely recognized dataset in the field of reinforcement learning.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
