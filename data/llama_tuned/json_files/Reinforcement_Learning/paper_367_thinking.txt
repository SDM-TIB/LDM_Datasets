To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Equivalence Between Policy Gradients and Soft Q-Learning" by John Schulman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the equivalence between policy gradients and soft Q-learning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction for more context.In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the theoretical foundations of their work but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed. Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors conducted experiments on the **Atari benchmark**. This indicates that the Atari games are used as the dataset for their experiments.Next, I will look for specific datasets or benchmarks mentioned in the **experiments section**. The authors mention using the **Atari games** for their experiments, which is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name, as the Atari games are a collection of games rather than a single dataset.Now, I will check the **related work section** to see if any other datasets are referenced. The authors cite various papers, but they do not introduce any new datasets in this section. I will also review the **conclusion** and **acknowledgments** sections for any additional mentions of datasets, but it appears that the focus remains on the Atari benchmark.Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the name of the dataset (Atari games) and any relevant details about its use in the experiments. Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset citation, I will note that the dataset is commonly known as the **Atari benchmark** and reference the original source for the Atari games, which is typically cited as: > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., Munos, R., et al. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for Generalizing Reinforcement Learning Algorithms*. In Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pages 1-15, 2013.Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset citation, I will note that the dataset is the **Atari games**, and reference the above citation for the Atari Learning Environment.Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the information gathered, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and citation in the required format.
