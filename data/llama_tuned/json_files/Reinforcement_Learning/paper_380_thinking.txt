To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks" by Chelsea Finn et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed method and its evaluations, which may include datasets used for testing. The introduction may provide context or mention specific datasets that are relevant to the research.Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments. I will look for subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Experiments" or "Evaluation."In this paper, the authors mention using the **Omniglot** and **MiniImagenet** datasets for their experiments. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations I expect to find are:- For **Omniglot**, the citation is: > Brenden M. Lake, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Jason G. Gross, and Joshua B. Tenenbaum. *One shot learning of simple visual concepts*. In Conference of the Cognitive Science Society (CogSci), 2011.- For **MiniImagenet**, the citation is: > Sachin Ravi and Hugo Larochelle. *Optimization as a model for few-shot learning*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
