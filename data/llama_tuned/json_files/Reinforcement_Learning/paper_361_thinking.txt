To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discrete Sequential Prediction of Continuous Actions for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Luke Metz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of off-policy methods for continuous control tasks, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **method section**, where the authors describe their approach and any datasets they utilized. In this paper, they mention evaluating their method on various continuous control tasks, specifically mentioning the **OpenAI Gym suite** and **Mujoco** environments. This indicates that these environments are likely datasets or benchmarks for their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they performed experiments on several continuous control tasks, including the **hopper, swimmer, half cheetah, walker2d, and humanoid environments** from the OpenAI Gym suite. This confirms that these environments are datasets used for their evaluations.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:1. **OpenAI Gym Suite**: The citation is: > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. 2016.2. **Mujoco**: The citation is: > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on, pages 5026a5033, 2012.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
