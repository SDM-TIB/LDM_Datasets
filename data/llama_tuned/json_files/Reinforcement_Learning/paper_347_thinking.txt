To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReGAN: RE[LAX|BAR|INFORCE] based Sequence Generation using GANs" by Aparna Balagopalan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of synthetic datasets for sequence generation, which indicates that datasets are likely included.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two synthetic datasets:1. **Synthetic Dataset with Simple Grammar**: This dataset is created with a simple grammar consisting of alternating between the symbol "x" and operators +, -, *, /. The authors specify that the vocabulary size is five, and they build two training sets of size 10,000 with sequences of lengths three and fifteen. They provide examples of training sequences, which gives me a clear understanding of the dataset's structure and purpose.2. **Obama Speech Dataset**: The authors reference the Obama speech dataset, which is used for pre-training the model. However, they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset in the text. I will need to look for the full citation in the **References section**.The citation for the Obama speech dataset is:> Lantao Yu, Weinan Zhang, Jun Wang, and Yong Yu. *SeqGAN: Sequence Generative Adversarial Nets with Policy Gradient*. In AAAI, pages 2852a2858, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
