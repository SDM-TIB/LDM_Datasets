To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implementing the Deep Q-Network" by Melrose Roderick et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the implementation of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) and mentions the use of the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, which suggests that this is a dataset or environment used in their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **implementation details** sections. In the introduction, the authors reference the original DQN paper by Mnih et al. [2015], which is a key dataset for their experiments. They mention using the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)** to play Atari 2600 video games, which is a well-known dataset in reinforcement learning.In the **implementation details section**, the authors describe their implementation and mention that they used the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)** to interact with the Atari games. This confirms that ALE is indeed a dataset used in their experiments.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). The citation is:- For **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, the citation is: > M. G. Bellemare, Y. Naddaf, J. Veness, and M. Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253a279, 2013.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) as it is the only dataset mentioned in the paper.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) in the required format, ensuring that the citation is included for clarity and completeness.
