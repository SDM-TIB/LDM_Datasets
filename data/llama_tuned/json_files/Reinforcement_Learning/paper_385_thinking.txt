To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weighted Double Deep Multiagent Reinforcement Learning in Stochastic Cooperative Environments" by Yan Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed method and its performance on various environments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention two specific environments for their experiments:1. **Pacman-like Grid World**: This is a well-known environment in reinforcement learning, where agents navigate a grid world to reach a goal while avoiding obstacles. The authors describe the environment's characteristics, including the stochastic rewards and the grid layout.2. **Predator Game**: This is another environment used in the experiments, where two agents must coordinate to achieve a common goal while avoiding obstacles. The authors detail the rules and rewards associated with this environment.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about the environments, including the number of episodes and the types of rewards. However, they do not mention any external datasets but rather describe the environments themselves as the datasets used for evaluation.Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the environments mentioned. The environments are based on standard reinforcement learning benchmarks, so I will look for the original papers that introduced these environments:- For the **Pacman-like Grid World**, the citation is: > Sutton, R. S., & Barto, A. G. (1998). *Reinforcement learning: An introduction*. MIT Press.- For the **Predator Game**, the citation is: > Benda, M., Jagannathan, V., & Dodhiwala, R. (1986). *On optimal cooperation of knowledge sources - an empirical investigation*. Technical Report BCSaG2010a28, Boeing Advanced Technology Center, Boeing Computing Services, 1986.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each environment as they are the primary datasets used in the experiments. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
