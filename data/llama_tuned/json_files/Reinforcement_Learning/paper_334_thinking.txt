To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Energy-eficient Amortized Inference with Cascaded Deep Classifiers" by Jiaqi Guan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and implementation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several image classification datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **implementation section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they list three datasets:1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class for training and 1,000 images per class for testing.2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class for training and 50 images per class for testing.3. **ImageNet32x32**: This dataset is a downsampled version of the original ImageNet dataset, containing 1.2 million 32x32 RGB images across 1000 classes, with 1,200 images per class for training and 50 images per class for testing.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is: > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., & LeCun, Y. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. *Technical Report*, 6.- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is: > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. *Technical Report*, 6.- For **ImageNet32x32**, the citation is: > Chrabaszcz, P., Loshchilov, I., & Hutter, F. (2017). A downsampled variant of ImageNet as an alternative to the CIFAR datasets. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.08819*.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
