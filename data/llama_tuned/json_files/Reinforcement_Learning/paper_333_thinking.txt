To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classifying Options for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Kai Arulkumaran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of reinforcement learning and mentions the game of "Catch," which suggests that this might be a dataset or environment used in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the environments they used. In this section, they explicitly mention the "Catch" game as the primary environment for their experiments. This indicates that "Catch" is a dataset or a specific environment used for training and evaluation.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the "Catch" game, including its characteristics and how it is used to evaluate their proposed method. They mention that the game involves controlling a paddle to catch falling balls, which implies that the dataset consists of game states and actions taken during gameplay.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the "Catch" game or any related datasets. The relevant citation for the "Catch" game is:- For the "Catch" game, the citation is: > Volodymyr Mnih, Nicolas Heess, Alex Graves, et al. *Recurrent models of visual attention*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 2204a2212, 2014.Since the "Catch" game is the primary dataset used in the experiments, I will summarize it as follows:1. **Catch Game Dataset**: This dataset consists of a game environment where the task is to control a paddle to catch falling balls. The dataset includes game states and actions taken during gameplay, allowing for the evaluation of reinforcement learning algorithms.Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
