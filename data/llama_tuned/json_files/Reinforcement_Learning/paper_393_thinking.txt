To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Road layout understanding by generative adversarial inpainting" by Lorenzo Berlincioni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **Cityscapes dataset** and a novel synthetically generated dataset, which suggests that these are the datasets of interest.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to gather more context about the datasets. The authors mention the **Cityscapes dataset** as a well-known urban driving dataset, which is used for semantic segmentation tasks. This confirms its relevance.In the **experimental evaluation section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets. They explicitly state that they evaluate their method on the **Cityscapes dataset** and introduce a novel dataset generated using the **CARLA simulator**. This new dataset is referred to as the **MICC-SRI dataset**. I will need to extract the details about this dataset, including its purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned.In the **experimental evaluation section**, the authors describe the **MICC-SRI dataset** in detail, including how it was generated and the types of data it contains. They mention that it consists of pixel-wise aligned segmentations with and without dynamic objects, which is crucial for understanding its application in their research.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:1. For the **Cityscapes dataset**, the citation is: > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., Schiele, B. *The Cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 3213a3223, 2016.2. For the **MICC-SRI dataset**, the citation is: > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., LÃ³pez, A., Koltun, V. *CARLA: An open urban driving simulator*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.03938, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
