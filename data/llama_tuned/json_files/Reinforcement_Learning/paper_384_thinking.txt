To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Noisy Networks for Exploration" by Meire Fortunato et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a deep reinforcement learning agent with parametric noise, which suggests that datasets related to reinforcement learning may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on **57 Atari games**. This indicates that the dataset consists of Atari games, which is a well-known benchmark in reinforcement learning.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Atari games dataset. The relevant citation is:- For the **Atari games dataset**, the citation is: > Bellemare, M., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2015). *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. In Twenty-Fourth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), 2015.Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, ensuring to include the full citation as required. The dataset entry will include the name of the dataset, a brief description, and the citation.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review.
