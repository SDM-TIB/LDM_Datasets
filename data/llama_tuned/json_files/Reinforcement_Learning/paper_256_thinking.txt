To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AlphaStar: An Evolutionary Computation Perspective" by Kai Arulkumaran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses AlphaStar, a neural-network-based AI system, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any datasets used in their experiments.Next, I will examine the **methodology section** closely, as this is where datasets are often detailed. In this paper, the authors describe the training process of AlphaStar, but they do not specify any datasets used for training or evaluation. However, they do mention the game of StarCraft II, which suggests that the dataset might be related to game data rather than a traditional dataset.In the **background section**, the authors reference the game of StarCraft II, which is a key component of their experiments. They mention that AlphaStar was trained using a professional player, implying that the dataset consists of game data from StarCraft II. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation.Now, I will look for any additional information in the **results or discussion sections**. The authors discuss the performance of AlphaStar but do not mention any specific datasets used for evaluation or comparison. Since the paper does not provide a formal dataset citation, I will conclude that the dataset is related to the game of StarCraft II, but I will need to find the original source of the dataset to provide a full citation.Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset name or citation, I will note that the dataset is based on the game of StarCraft II, but I will not be able to provide a formal dataset entry with a citation. In summary, the dataset is not explicitly named in the paper, and I will document the relationship to the game of StarCraft II without a formal citation.
