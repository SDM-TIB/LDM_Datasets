To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decoupling Exploration and Exploitation in Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms" by CA edric Colas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of benchmarks for evaluating the proposed GEP-PG approach, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks used in their experiments. The introduction mentions two benchmarks: **Continuous Mountain Car (CMC)** and **Half-Cheetah (HC)**, which are likely datasets or environments used for evaluation.In the **methods section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of these benchmarks. The authors describe the **Continuous Mountain Car (CMC)** environment as a standard benchmark for continuous state, discrete action reinforcement learning, where the goal is to reach the top of a hill by gaining momentum from another hill. The **Half-Cheetah (HC)** benchmark is described as a larger benchmark where the agent moves a 2D bipedal body and is characterized by a Gradient Cliffa landscape property.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm how these datasets were utilized in the experiments. The authors mention that they used the implementations from OpenAI Gym for both benchmarks, which is important for citation purposes.Next, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The citations for the benchmarks are as follows:- For **Continuous Mountain Car (CMC)**, the citation is: > Brockman, Greg, Cheung, Vicki, Pettersson, Ludwig, Schneider, Jonas, Schulman, John, Tang, Jie, and Zaremba, Wojciech. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.- For **Half-Cheetah (HC)**, the citation is: > Brockman, Greg, Cheung, Vicki, Pettersson, Ludwig, Schneider, Jonas, Schulman, John, Tang, Jie, and Zaremba, Wojciech. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
