To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-training Neural Networks with Human Demonstrations for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Gabriel V. de la Cruz, Jr., Yunshu Du, and Matthew E. Taylor, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental design sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of human demonstrations for pre-training deep reinforcement learning models, which suggests that datasets related to human demonstrations might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental design section** where the authors describe their experiments. They mention testing their approach on the **Atari 2600 games of Pong, Freeway, and Beamrider**. This indicates that these games are part of the dataset used for evaluation.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the human demonstrations collected for each game. They mention that they collected every fourth frame of the game, including the game state, action taken, reward received, and terminal state. This suggests that the dataset consists of human demonstrations for these Atari games.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets or related works that describe the datasets used. The authors reference the **Atari 2600 games** and the **OpenAI Gym** for their experiments, but they do not provide specific dataset citations in the references. However, I can infer that the datasets are based on the standard Atari 2600 games and the OpenAI Gym framework, which is widely recognized in the field of reinforcement learning.The Atari 2600 games are a well-known dataset in the field, and I can cite the original paper that introduced the Atari 2600 games as a dataset:- For **Atari 2600 games**, the citation is: > M. G. Bellemare, Y. Naddaf, J. Veness, and M. Bowling. *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47, 1-29, 2013.Since the paper does not provide specific citations for the human demonstrations, I will note that the dataset consists of human demonstrations collected for the Atari 260ar games, but I will not include a separate citation for this part.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant citations for the Atari 2600 games and the OpenAI Gym framework. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
