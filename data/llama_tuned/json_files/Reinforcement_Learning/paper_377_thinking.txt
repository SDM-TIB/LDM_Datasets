To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Formulation of Deep Reinforcement Learning Architecture Toward Autonomous Driving for On-Ramp Merge" by Pin Wang and Ching-Yao Chan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and implementation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of autonomous driving and the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for on-ramp merging, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction for more context.In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for a robust and reliable merging policy but do not provide specific dataset names. I will continue to the **methodology section**, where they describe the use of real-world driving data collected from cameras placed on a high pole to record on-ramp merging scenarios. This indicates that a dataset is involved, but I need to find the exact name and details.Next, I will look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **implementation section**. The authors state that the data to train the LSTM model is obtained from real-world driving data, but they do not specify the exact dataset name. However, they mention that the data is collected from cameras, which suggests that it is a real-world dataset rather than a synthetic one.I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets. The authors reference several studies, but they do not provide specific dataset names or citations in the text. However, I will look for any datasets mentioned in the context of the experiments or methodologies used in the paper.Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:1. **Real-world driving data**: The authors collected data from cameras placed on a high pole to record on-ramp merging scenarios. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation for this dataset.2. **Synthetic datasets**: The paper mentions the use of simulated scenarios for training the LSTM model, but it does not specify the name of the simulation environment or any datasets used for this purpose.After reviewing the paper, I will compile the findings, noting that while the authors reference real-world data, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations. This indicates that the datasets are either proprietary or not publicly available with citations in the provided text.
