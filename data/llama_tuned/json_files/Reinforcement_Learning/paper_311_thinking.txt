To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning in Bayesian Stackelberg Markov Games for Adaptive Moving Target Defense" by Sailik Sengupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a game-theoretic model for Moving Target Defense (MTD) and mentions the use of a game simulator, which suggests that datasets related to MTD scenarios might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using a game simulator for two MTD scenarios: one for web-application security and another for cloud-network security. They reference the following datasets:1. **Moving Target Defense (MTD) for Web-applications**: The authors use a game simulator designed from the work of Sengupta et al. (2017) to model MTD scenarios. They specify that the game parameters are obtained from this reference.2. **Moving Target Defense (MTD) for IDS Placement**: The authors also utilize a game simulator based on the work of Zhu and Bašar (2009) for modeling MTD in cloud networks. They mention using the General-Sum Markov Game formulated in this domain.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Moving Target Defense (MTD) for Web-applications**, the citation is: > Sailik Sengupta, Satya Gautam Vadlamudi, Subbarao Kambhampati, Adam Doupé, Ziming Zhao, Marthony Taguinod, and Gail-Joon Ahn. *A game theoretic approach to strategy generation for moving target defense in web applications*. In Proceedings of the 16th Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, pages 178a186. International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, 2017.- For the **Moving Target Defense (MTD) for IDS Placement**, the citation is: > Quanyan Zhu and Tamer Bašar. *Dynamic policy-based IDS configuration*. In Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference, pages 8600a8605. IEEE, 2009.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
