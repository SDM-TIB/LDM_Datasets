To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Movement Strategies for Forming Target Defense" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a game-theoretic model for Moving Target Defense (MTD) scenarios, which suggests that datasets related to MTD might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using a game simulator for two MTD scenarios: one for web-application security and another for cloud-network security. They reference the game parameters obtained from a previous work, specifically citing the following datasets:1. **Moving Target Defense (MTD) for Web-Applications**: The authors reference the work by Sengupta et al. (2017) for modeling MTD scenarios. They mention using the game parameters obtained from this paper to design their game simulator. The dataset includes four states representing different configurations of the system and three attacker types with specific actions.2. **Moving Target Defense (MTD) for Cloud-Network Security**: This dataset is derived from the work by Sengupta et al. (2019) and involves a General-Sum Markov Game for strategic detection of advanced persistent threats. It includes four states and a specific set of actions related to intrusion detection systems.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Moving Target Defense (MTD) for Web-Applications**, the citation is: > Sailik Sengupta, Satya Gautam Vadlamudi, Subbarao Kambhampati, Adam DoupA, Ziming Zhao, Marthony Taguinod, and Gail-Joon Ahn. *A game theoretic approach to strategy generation for moving target defense in web applications*. In Proceedings of the 16th Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, pages 178a186. International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, 2017.- For the **Moving Target Defense (MTD) for Cloud-Network Security**, the citation is: > Sailik Sengupta, Ankur Chowdhary, Dijiang Huang, and Subbarao Kambhampati. *General sum markov games for strategic detection of advanced persistent threats using moving target defense in cloud networks*. In International Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security, pages 492a512. Springer, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
