To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual Learning with Deep Generative Replay" by Hanul Shin and Jung Kwon Lee, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and mentions testing methods on image classification tasks, which suggests that datasets related to image classification may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experiments and mention specific datasets used for testing their methods. They refer to the **MNIST handwritten digit database** and the **Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.I will also check the **related works section** to see if any other datasets are mentioned or referenced. The authors cite various works that may have introduced or utilized specific datasets, which could provide additional context or confirm the datasets used in their experiments.Now, I will look at the **references section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:1. For the **MNIST handwritten digit database**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278a2324, 1998.2. For the **Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278a2324, 1998.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations for future reference or analysis.
