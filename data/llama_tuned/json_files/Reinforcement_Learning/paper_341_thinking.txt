To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Factor Policies and Action-Value Functions: Factored Action Space Representations for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Sahil Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods on various domains, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of Atari 2600 games.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Atari 2600 dataset** for their experiments. They specifically state that they demonstrate their proposed paradigm on two DRL algorithms, FARA3C and FARAQL, on 14 tasks in the Atari domain, which indicates that the Atari 2600 dataset is central to their work.I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the datasets, such as the number of tasks, the evaluation metrics, or any specific configurations used. The authors provide a table in Appendix C that summarizes the performance of their methods on various Atari 2600 tasks, which reinforces the use of the Atari 2600 dataset.Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the Atari 2600 dataset. The relevant citation is:- For the **Atari 2600 dataset**, the citation is: > Bellemare, Marc G., Naddaf, Yavar, Veness, Joel, and Bowling, Michael. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, pp. 253a279, June 2013.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the Atari 2600 dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Atari 2600 dataset, ensuring that it includes the necessary details such as the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
