To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Brandom-ian view of Reinforcement Learning towards strong-AI" by Trisha Sarkard, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the application of reinforcement learning and mentions the Game Of Giving and Asking For Reasons (GOGAR), which suggests that there may be datasets related to this game or its applications.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the philosophical aspects of reinforcement learning and mentions the Game Of Giving and Asking For Reasons (GOGAR), but it does not specify any datasets. I will need to look further into the paper.In the **methodology or experiments section**, I will look for any datasets used for training or evaluation. The paper discusses the restructuring of the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm in the context of the GOGAR game, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of reinforcement learning or the GOGAR game.Since the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets mentioned in this paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide any dataset entries or citations. If the paper had included datasets, I would have gathered the necessary information, including full citations, to create structured entries for each dataset.After completing this process, I will summarize my findings, noting that no datasets were identified in the paper.
