To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MOVI: A Model-Free Approach to Dynamic Fleet Management" by Takuma Oda and Carlee Joe-Wong, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a model-free approach for dynamic fleet management, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, particularly in the context of taxi dispatching.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methodology sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the use of a large-scale realistic simulator based on **15 million taxi trip records from New York City**. This is a strong indication that a specific dataset is being utilized.In the **methodology section**, the authors provide more details about the simulator, stating that it is based on **15.6 million New York City taxi trip records**. This confirms the dataset's relevance and provides a specific number of records, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:- For the **New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission trip records**, the citation is: > New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. *Trip record data*. Available at: http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtmlNow that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation, which is essential for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent analysis or application of the findings.
