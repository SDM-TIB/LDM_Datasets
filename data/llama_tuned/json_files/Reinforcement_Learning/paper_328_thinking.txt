To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Faster Deep Q-learning using Neural Episodic Control" by Daichi Nishio and Satoshi Yamane, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of reinforcement learning and mentions the Pong game, which suggests that a dataset related to this game may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Pong game from OpenAI Gym** for their experiments. This indicates that Pong is a dataset or environment used for training and testing their proposed method, NEC2DQN.In the **implementation section**, the authors explicitly state that they use the **Pong game** from OpenAI Gym, which is a well-known dataset in reinforcement learning. They provide a link to the OpenAI Gym repository, confirming that this is the dataset they utilized.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenAI Gym, as it is crucial for proper attribution. The citation for OpenAI Gym is:- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is: > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Pong game from OpenAI Gym.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Pong game, ensuring that it includes the necessary details and citation, ready for further processing or review.
