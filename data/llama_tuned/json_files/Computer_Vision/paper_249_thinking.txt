To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Composite Shape Modeling via Latent Space Factorization" by Anastasia Dubrovina et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a novel neural network architecture for 3D shape modeling, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, particularly in the context of shape reconstruction and synthesis.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention using the **ShapeNet 3D data collection** for their experiments. This is a significant dataset for 3D shape modeling, and I need to gather more details about it.In the **experiments section**, the authors specify that they converted the shapes from ShapeNet to 32x32x32 occupancy grids, which indicates that ShapeNet is the primary dataset used in their work. They also mention that they used part annotations produced by Yi et al. for semantic part labeling, which further confirms the dataset's relevance.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ShapeNet dataset. The citation is as follows:> Angel X Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ShapeNet dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for ShapeNet, ensuring that it includes all necessary details for clarity and completeness.
