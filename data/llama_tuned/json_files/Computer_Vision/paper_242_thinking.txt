To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Linearized Multi-Sampling for Differentiable Image Transformation" by Wei Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed method for image sampling and mentions performance improvements on various datasets, indicating that datasets are indeed used in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **results section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they explicitly mention three datasets: **MNIST**, **GTSRB**, and **Pascal VOC 2012**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.In the **results section**, the authors describe the datasets as follows:1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.2. **GTSRB**: A dataset for traffic sign recognition, containing 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing.3. **Pascal VOC 2012**: A dataset for object detection and segmentation, consisting of 11 classes with a total of 11,000 images for training and 11,000 for testing.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For **MNIST**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, LAeon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE, pages 2278a2324, 1998.- For **GTSRB**, the citation is: > Johannes Stallkamp, Marc Schlipsing, Jan Salmen, and Christian Igel. *The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark*. In IJCNN, 2011.- For **Pascal VOC 2012**, the citation is: > Mark Everingham, John Winn, I. Williams, Luc Van Gool, Christopher D. W. Clark, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2010.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
