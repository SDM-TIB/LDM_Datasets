To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GPipe: Easy Scaling with Micro-Batch Pipeline Parallelism" by Yanping Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of GPipe for scaling deep neural networks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **ImageNet-2012 dataset** for image classification and a **multilingual neural machine translation corpus** for their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:1. **ImageNet-2012**: This dataset is used for training the AmoebaNet model, achieving a top-1 accuracy of 84.4%. The citation for ImageNet-2012 is: > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In CVPR, IEEE, 2009.2. **Multilingual Neural Machine Translation Corpus**: This dataset is used for training a multilingual Transformer model. The authors mention that it contains a total of 25 billion training examples across 102 languages and English. The citation for this dataset is: > Naveen Arivazhagan, Ankur Bapna, Orhan Firat, Dmitry Lepikhin, Melvin Johnson, Maxim Krikun, Mia Xu Chen, Yuan Cao, George Foster, Colin Cherry, et al. *Massively multilingual neural machine translation in the wild: Findings and challenges*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.05019, 2019.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
