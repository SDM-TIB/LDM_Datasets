To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient and Deep Person Re-Identiification using Multi-Level Similarity" by Yiluan Guo and Ngai-Man Cheung, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a novel Siamese network for person re-identification, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention testing their method on four datasets: **CUHK03 detected and labeled**, **CUHK01**, and **VIPeR**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief description of each dataset:1. **CUHK03 detected and labeled**: This dataset contains 13,164 images of 1,360 identities captured by 6 cameras. It is a large dataset used for person re-identification tasks.2. **CUHK01**: This dataset consists of 3884 images of 971 identities, which is a smaller dataset compared to CUHK03.3. **VIPeR**: This dataset has 632 identities and is used for evaluating person re-identification methods.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **CUHK03 detected and labeled**, the citation is: > W. Li, R. Zhao, T. Xiao, and X. Wang. *DeepReID: Deep Filter Pairing Neural Network for Person Re-Identification*. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2014.- For **CUHK01**, the citation is: > W. Li, R. Zhao, and X. Wang. *Human Re-Identification with Deep Feature Alignment*. In Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV), November 2012.- For **VIPeR**, the citation is: > D. Gray, S. Brennan, and H. Tao. *Evaluating Appearance Models for Recognition, Reacquisition, and Tracking*. In IEEE International Workshop on Performance Evaluation for Tracking and Surveillance (PETS), October 2007.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
