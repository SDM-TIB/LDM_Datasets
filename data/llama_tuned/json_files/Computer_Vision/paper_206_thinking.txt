To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Semantic Role Labeling with Cross-View Training" by Rui Cai and Mirella Lapata, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of neural networks for semantic role labeling and mentions the use of benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **CoNLL-2009 benchmark dataset** for their experiments. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.I will also check the **related work section** to see if the authors reference any other datasets that might have been used in their experiments or comparisons. However, the primary dataset mentioned appears to be the CoNLL-2009 benchmark.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their model on the **CoNLL-2009 benchmark dataset**, confirming its significance in their research.Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the CoNLL-2009 dataset. The citation is as follows:> Bj√∂rkengren, Anders, and Bernd Bohnet. "A high-performance syntactic parser." In Proceedings of the 2009 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 33a36, 2010.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the CoNLL-2009 benchmark dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format for further processing or review.
