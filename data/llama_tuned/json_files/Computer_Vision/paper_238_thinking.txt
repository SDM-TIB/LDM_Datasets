To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Spatial Transformer Network" by Chang Shu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed method and mentions two experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. They mention two specific datasets:1. **Cluttered MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset**: This dataset is a modified version of the classic MNIST dataset, which is cluttered with more noise. The authors provide details about how they implemented their experiments on this dataset.2. **Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of evaluating the performance of their method on image alignment tasks. The authors mention that their method achieved state-of-the-art results on this dataset.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Cluttered MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010.- For the **Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset**, the citation is: > Catherine Wah, Steve Branson, Peter Welinder, Pietro Perona, and Serge Belongie. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. 2011.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
