To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ssEMnet: Serial-section Electron Microscopy Image Registration using a Spatial Transformer Network with Learned Features" by Inwan Yoo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods section**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of aligning serial-section electron microscopy (ssEM) images and mention the need for datasets. However, they do not specify the datasets used in their experiments yet.In the **methods section**, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the datasets they used for evaluation. They mention three datasets:1. **Drosophila TEM images**: This dataset consists of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Drosophila brain sections. The authors provide a brief description of the dataset, noting that it includes approximately 4 million camera images and 50 TB of raw data.2. **CREMI challenge dataset**: This dataset is derived from the CREMI challenge, which provides labeled TEM images of Drosophila brains. The authors specify that they used a small sub-volume of this dataset for their experiments.3. **Mouse lateral geniculate nucleus SEM dataset**: This dataset consists of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of mouse brain sections, which contain fold artifacts. The authors mention that they used a specific sub-volume of this dataset for their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Drosophila TEM dataset**, the citation is: > Hayworth, K. J., Morgan, J. L., Schalek, R., Berger, D. R., Hildebrand, D. G. C., & Lichtman, J. W. (2014). Imaging ATUM ultrathin section libraries with WaferMapper: a multi-scale approach to EM reconstruction of neural circuits. *Frontiers in Neural Circuits*, 8, 68.- For the **CREMI challenge dataset**, the citation is: > CREMI challenge. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://cremi.org/- For the **Mouse lateral geniculate nucleus SEM dataset**, the citation is: > Morgan, J. L., Berger, D. R., Wetzel, A. W., & Lichtman, J. W. (2017). The fuzzy logic of network connectivity in mouse visual thalamus. *Cell*, 170(3), 192-206.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, into a structured format for further processing or review. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, which are crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work.
