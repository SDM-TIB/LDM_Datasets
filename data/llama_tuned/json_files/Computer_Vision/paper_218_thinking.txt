To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One Shot Learning for Deformable Medical Image Registration and Periodic Motion Tracking" by Tobias Fechter and Dimos Baltas, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their algorithm on multiple 4D and 3D datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **data section** (section II) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:1. **DirLab**: This dataset consists of 10 4D CTs of the thoracic region, each containing 10 3D CTs with manually set reference landmarks for registration evaluation.2. **Popi**: This dataset includes six 4D CTs of the lung region, with landmarks for registration evaluation, specifically for the first three patients and the maximum inhalation and exhalation phases.3. **Sunnybrook**: This dataset contains cardiac MRI datasets, specifically 12 datasets used for training data in the MICCAI left ventricle segmentation challenge, which include cine-MRI images from patients with different pathologies and expert-drawn contours for validation.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **DirLab**, the citation is: > R. Castillo et al., "A framework for evaluation of deformable image registration spatial accuracy using large landmark point sets," *Physics in Medicine & Biology*, vol. 54, no. 7, p. 1849, 2009.- For **Popi**, the citation is: > J. Vandemeulebroucke et al., "Spatiotemporal motion estimation for respiratory-correlated imaging of the lungs," *Medical Physics*, vol. 38, no. 1, pp. 166a178, 2011.- For **Sunnybrook**, the citation is: > P. Radau et al., "Evaluation framework for algorithms segmenting short axis cardiac MRI," *The MIDAS Journal-Cardiac MR Left Ventricle Segmentation Challenge*, vol. 49, 2009.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
