To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Lane and Road Markings at A Distance with Perspective Transformer Layers" by Zhuoping Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on two public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the datasets used for validation. They explicitly state that they evaluate their method on the **TuSimple** and **ApolloScape** datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for the research.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more details about each dataset:1. **TuSimple Benchmark**: This dataset consists of 3626 training and 2782 testing images, with annotations including the x-position of lane points at various discretized y-positions.2. **ApolloScape**: This dataset contains over 110,000 frames with high-quality pixel-level annotations, including various types of lane and road markings from daily traffic scenarios.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For **TuSimple**, the citation is: > Tusimple Lane Detection Benchmark. http://benchmark.tusimple.ai/- For **ApolloScape**, the citation is: > Xinyu Huang, Xinjing Cheng, Qichuan Geng, Binbin Cao, Dingfu Zhou, Peng Wang, Yuanqing Lin, and Ruigang Yang. *The ApolloScape Dataset for Autonomous Driving*. arXiv: 1803.06184, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
