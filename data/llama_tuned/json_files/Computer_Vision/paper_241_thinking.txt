To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enriched Deep Recurrent Visual Attention Model for Multiple Object Recognition" by Artsiom Ablavatski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on two publicly available datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they state that their model was evaluated on the **MNIST Cluttered dataset** and the **SVHN dataset**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For the **MNIST Cluttered dataset**, the citation is: > V. Mnih, N. Heess, A. Graves, et al. *Recurrent models of visual attention*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 2204a2212, 2014.- For the **SVHN dataset**, the citation is: > I. J. Goodfellow, Y. Bulatov, J. Ibarz, S. Arnoud, and V. Shet. *Multi-digit number recognition from street view imagery using deep convolutional neural networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.6082, 2013.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
