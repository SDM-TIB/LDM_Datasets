To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer-Transducer: End-to-End Speech Recognition with Self-Attention" by Ching-Feng Yeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **LibriSpeech corpus**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They mention that they used the **LibriSpeech corpus** for their experiments, which is a well-known dataset in the field of speech recognition. They specify that it contains 960 hours of read speech data for training and four sets for evaluation.In the **references section**, I will look for the full citation of the **LibriSpeech corpus**. The citation is as follows:> Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: An ASR Corpus Based on Public Domain Audio Books*. In 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206a5210, 2015.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset name and its citation from the paper.
