To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Densely Fused Spatial Transformer Networks" by Roberto Annunziata et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they state that they evaluated their method on two widely used datasets:1. **MNIST**: This dataset is commonly used for handwritten digit recognition tasks. The authors mention using it for their experiments.2. **GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)**: This dataset is specifically designed for traffic sign recognition and is also utilized in their experiments.3. **IDocDB (Non-public dataset of official identity documents)**: This dataset is a non-public dataset that includes images of official identity documents, which the authors describe as containing substantially larger images and real perspective transformations.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **MNIST**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/- For **GTSRB**, the citation is: > Johannes Stallkamp, Marc Schlipsing, Jan Salmen, and Christian Igel. *The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark: A Multi-Class Classification Competition*. In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), pages 1453a1460, 2011.- For **IDocDB**, since it is a non-public dataset, I will note that it is described in the paper but does not have a formal citation like the other datasets. Instead, I will reference the paper itself as the source of the dataset information.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the publicly available datasets and a note about the non-public IDocDB dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
