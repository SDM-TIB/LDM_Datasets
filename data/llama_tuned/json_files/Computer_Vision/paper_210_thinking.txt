To extract datasets from the research paper titled "R-Transformer: Recurrent Neural Network Enhanced Transformer" by Zhiwei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed model on various sequence learning tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets used for their experiments, including:1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for handwritten digit recognition tasks. The authors describe how they rescale the MNIST images into sequences for their experiments.2. **Nottingham Dataset**: This dataset is used for polyphonic music modeling, containing British and American folk tunes. The authors provide details about the dataset's structure and how it is split into training, validation, and testing sets.3. **Penn Treebank Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for language modeling tasks, containing 1 million words. The authors describe how they split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets for their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, LAon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, Patrick Haffner, et al. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278a2324, 1998.- For the **Nottingham Dataset**, the citation is: > Nicolas Boulanger-Lewandowski, Yoshua Bengio, and Pascal Vincent. *Modeling temporal dependencies in high-dimensional sequences: Application to polyphonic music generation and transcription*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1206.6392, 2012.- For the **Penn Treebank Dataset**, the citation is: > Mitchell Marcus, Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. 1993.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
