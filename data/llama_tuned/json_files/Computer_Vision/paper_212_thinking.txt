To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LARGE BATCH OPTIMIZATION FOR DEEP LEARNING: TRAINING BERT IN 76 MINUTES" by Yang You et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the optimization of deep learning models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, particularly in the context of BERT training.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention using the **SQuAD task** for BERT training, which is a well-known dataset for natural language processing tasks. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its size and characteristics.In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they use the same dataset as Devlin et al. (2018) for BERT training, which is a concatenation of Wikipedia and BooksCorpus. This is a significant dataset for their experiments, and I will note its details.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the SQuAD task is:- For **SQuAD**, the citation is: > Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova. *BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.04805, 2018.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the SQuAD dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for SQuAD, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
