To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VL-BERT: PRE-TRAINING OF GENERIC VISUAL-LINGUISTIC REPRESENTATIONS" by Weijie Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors pre-train their model on the **Conceptual Captions dataset**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the **Conceptual Captions dataset** again, confirming its importance for their work. They also refer to the **BooksCorpus** and **English Wikipedia** as text-only datasets used for pre-training.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they pre-train their model on the **Conceptual Captions dataset** and the **BooksCorpus** and **English Wikipedia** for pre-training. This reinforces the datasets used in their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **Conceptual Captions dataset**, the citation is: > Piyush Sharma, Nan Ding, Sebastian Goodman, and Radu Soricut. *Conceptual captions: A cleaned, hypernymed, image alt-text dataset for automatic image captioning*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 2556a2565, 2018.2. For the **BooksCorpus**, the citation is: > Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Michael Bernstein, and Li Fei-Fei. *Visual7w: Grounded question answering in images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 4995a5004, 2016.3. For the **English Wikipedia**, the citation is: > Yuke Zhu, Ryan Kiros, Rich Zemel, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Raquel Urtasun, Antonio Torralba, and Sanja Fidler. *Aligning books and movies: Towards story-like visual explanations by watching movies and reading books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on computer vision, pp. 19a27, 2015.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the references found in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
