To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Distance Relationships without Time Travel: Boosting the Performance of a Sparse Predictive Autoencoder in Sequence Modeling" by Jeremy Gordon, David Rawlinson, and Subutai Ahmad, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of a predictive autoencoder for sequence modeling, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of language modeling.Next, I will focus on the **method section**, where the authors describe their model and the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention two specific datasets:1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is used for the stochastic sequential MNIST task, which involves generating sequences of MNIST digits based on a predetermined grammar. The authors describe the task and its characteristics, indicating that MNIST is a key dataset for their experiments.2. **Penn Treebank (PTB) Dataset**: The authors also mention using the PTB dataset for language modeling tasks. They describe the preprocessing steps and the results obtained from their experiments, confirming that PTB is another dataset utilized in their research.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/- For the **Penn Treebank (PTB) Dataset**, the citation is: > Mark Davies. *The Penn Treebank Corpus of Written English*. 1990. Available: http://www.ling.uci.edu/~mldawg/Projects/ptb.htmlAfter gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
