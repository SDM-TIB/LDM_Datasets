To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AlphaStar: An Evolutionary Computation Perspective" by Kai Arulkumaran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses AlphaStar's achievements in beating a professional player at StarCraft II, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this game.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the training or evaluation of AlphaStar. The introduction mentions the use of AlphaStar to beat a professional player, but it does not specify any datasets. I will need to look further into the paper for more detailed information.In the **methodology section**, I will focus on any subsections that describe the datasets used for training or testing AlphaStar. The paper discusses the use of population-based training (PBT) and mentions the AlphaStar system's performance against a professional player, but it does not provide specific dataset names or citations. I will also check the **experiments section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the experiments conducted with AlphaStar.After reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets in the text. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper, as no specific datasets are referenced or described in detail.In summary, I will compile my findings, noting that no datasets were identified in the paper, and I will ensure to document this clearly, as it is crucial to provide accurate information about datasets in research papers.
