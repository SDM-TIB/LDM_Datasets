To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Perturbation Analysis for Scalable Certified Robustness and Beyond" by Kaidi Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a framework for perturbation analysis, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, particularly in the context of certified defense and robustness verification.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using **Tiny ImageNet** and **Downscaled ImageNet** for their experiments. I will extract detailed descriptions of these datasets from the paper.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide performance metrics and results for various models trained on these datasets. They mention that they achieve state-of-the-art results on **Tiny ImageNet** and **Downscaled ImageNet**, which indicates their significance in the study.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/- For **Downscaled ImageNet**, the citation is: > P. Chrabaszcz, I. Loshchilov, and F. Hutter. *A downsampled variant of imagenet as an alternative to the cifar datasets*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.08819, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
