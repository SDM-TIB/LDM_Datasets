To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identity-preserving Face Recovery from Stylized Portraits" by Fatemeh Shiri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive evaluations on a large-scale synthesized dataset and a hand-drawn sketch dataset, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **synthesis and training datasets** sections. The authors mention synthesizing a large-scale dataset of pairs of stylized and photorealistic faces, which is crucial for understanding the datasets used in their experiments. They specifically reference the **CelebA dataset** for training and the **CUFSF dataset** for testing the face recovery method.In the **synthesis and training datasets** section, the authors describe the process of creating the synthesized dataset, which includes:1. **Synthesized Dataset**: This dataset consists of pairs of stylized and photorealistic faces synthesized from the **CelebA dataset**. The authors specify that they randomly selected 110K faces from CelebA for training and 2K face images for testing.2. **Hand-Drawn Sketch Dataset**: The authors also mention using the **FERET dataset** for testing the face recovery method, particularly for recovering faces from sketches.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **CelebA dataset**, the citation is: > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., Tang, X. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1681-1688, 2015.- For the **FERET dataset**, the citation is: > Phillips, P. J., Wechsler, H., Huang, J., Rauss, P. J. *The FERET database and evaluation procedure for face-recognition algorithms*. Image and Vision Computing, 16(5):295a306, 1998.With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
