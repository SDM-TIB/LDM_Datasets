To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Data Augmentation for Consistency Training" by Qizhe Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors mention several datasets used for text classification tasks, including:1. **IMDb Dataset**: This dataset is used for text classification tasks, specifically for sentiment analysis. The authors note that their method achieves an error rate of 4.20 on this dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art models trained on larger datasets.2. **Yelp-2 Dataset**: Another text classification dataset used in the experiments, which is part of the Yelp dataset. The authors mention that their method performs well on this dataset, achieving competitive results.3. **Yelp-5 Dataset**: Similar to Yelp-2, this dataset is also used for text classification tasks and is part of the Yelp dataset. The authors report improved performance on this dataset compared to state-of-the-art models.4. **Amazon-2 Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification tasks and is part of the Amazon dataset. The authors highlight the effectiveness of their method on this dataset.5. **Amazon-5 Dataset**: Another sentiment classification dataset from the Amazon dataset, which is used in the experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.Next, I will check the **related work and references sections** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.The full citations for the datasets are as follows:- For **IMDb Dataset**, the citation is: > Andrew L Maas, Raymond E Daly, Peter T Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics: Human language technologies-volume 1, pages 142a150. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2011.- For **Yelp-2 Dataset**, the citation is: > Andrew L Maas, Raymond E Daly, Peter T Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics: Human language technologies-volume 1, pages 142a150. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2011.- For **Yelp-5 Dataset**, the citation is: > Andrew L Maas, Raymond E Daly, Peter T Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics: Human language technologies-volume 1, pages 142a150. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2011.- For **Amazon-2 Dataset**, the citation is: > Andrew L Maas, Raymond E Daly, Peter T Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics: Human language technologies-volume 1, pages 142a150. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2011.- For **Amazon-5 Dataset**, the citation is: > Andrew L Maas, Raymond E Daly, Peter T Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics: Human language technologies-volume 1, pages 142a150. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2011.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
