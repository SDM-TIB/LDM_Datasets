To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Injecting Hierarchy with U-Net Transformers" by David Donahue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of a novel Transformer architecture and mentions empirical evaluations on dialogue generation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two datasets:1. **Cornell Movie Dialogues corpus**: This dataset consists of 60,000 dialogue pairs from movie scripts, capturing a variety of human interactions in different fictional circumstances.2. **PersonaChat dataset**: This dataset contains conversations constructed by assigning a persona to two Mechanical Turkers, resulting in longer conversation histories and the opportunity to form more abstract representations of the input conversation history.I will also check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Cornell Movie Dialogues corpus**, the citation is: > Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lillian Lee. *Chameleons in imagined conversations: A new approach to understanding coordination of linguistic style in dialogs*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics, 2011.- For the **PersonaChat dataset**, the citation is: > Saizheng Zhang, Emily Dinan, Jack Urbanek, Arthur Szlam, Douwe Kiela, and Jason Weston. *Personalizing dialogue agents: I have a dog, do you have pets too?*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.07243, 2018.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
