To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning with Increasing Object Shape Bias" by Zhibo Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the challenges of large-scale annotation data and hints at the use of datasets for training models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for their experiments, which is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision. I will note the details provided about ImageNet, including its purpose and how it was utilized in the experiments.In the **introduction**, the authors reference the limitations of large-scale annotation data, which reinforces the importance of datasets like ImageNet. However, they do not mention any other datasets in this section.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for ImageNet is typically:> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015. https://www.image-net.org/Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
