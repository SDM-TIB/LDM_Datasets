To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Regression Architecture with Two-Stage Re-initialization for High Performance Facial Landmark Detection" by Jiangjing Lv et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention two datasets:1. **300-W Dataset**: This dataset consists of five existing datasets (iBug, LFPW, AFW, HELEN, and XM2VTS) that are re-annotated with 68 landmarks. The authors specify that they used 3,148 images for training and 689 images for testing.2. **AFLW Dataset**: This dataset contains 24,386 faces with a large variety of appearances, including pose, expression, ethnicity, and age. The authors state that they used the same 20,000 image training set and 4,386 test set for evaluation.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **300-W Dataset**, the citation is: > C. Sagonas, G. Tzimiropoulos, S. Zafeiriou, and M. Pantic. *300 faces in-the-wild challenge: The first facial landmark localization challenge*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, 2013.- For the **AFLW Dataset**, the citation is: > M. Koestinger, P. Wohlhart, P. M. Roth, and H. Bischof. *Annotated facial landmarks in the wild: A large-scale, real-world database for facial landmark localization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Workshop on Benchmarking Facial Image Analysis Technologies, 2011.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
