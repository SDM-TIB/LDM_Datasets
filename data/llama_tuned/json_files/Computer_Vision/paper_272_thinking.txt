To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AllenNLP Interpret: A Framework for Explaining Predictions of NLP Models" by Eric Wallace et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the toolkit's purpose and the need for interpretable models, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **introduction** where the authors discuss the limitations of current NLP models and the need for interpretation methods. They mention various tasks and models but do not specify datasets.Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for evaluation or demonstration. In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **SQuAD dataset** for reading comprehension tasks and the **BiDAF model** for this task. They also reference the **NAQANet** and **DROP** datasets for other tasks, indicating their use in the toolkit's demonstrations.In the **related work section**, the authors mention the **SQuAD dataset** again, confirming its relevance to their work. I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **conclusion** or **acknowledgments** sections, but it appears that these datasets are central to the paper's contributions.Now, I will compile the identified datasets along with their citations from the **References section**. The citations for the datasets are as follows:- For **SQuAD**, the citation is: > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions from machine comprehension of text*. In EMNLP, pages 1-9, 2016.- For **BiDAF**, the citation is: > Min Joon Seo, Aniruddha Kembhavi, Ali Farhadi, and Hannaneh Hajirzi. *Bidirectional attention flow for machine comprehension*. In ICLR, 2017.- For **NAQANet**, the citation is: > Dheeru Dua, Yizhong Wang, Pradeep Dasigi, Gabriel Stanovsky, Sameer Singh, and Matt Gardner. *DROP: A reading comprehension benchmark requiring discrete reasoning over paragraphs*. In NAACL, 2019.- For **BiLSTM**, the citation is: > Matthew E. Peters, Mark Neumann, Mohit Iyyer, Matt Gardner, Christopher Clark, Kenton Lee, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *Deep contextualized word representations*. In NAACL, 2018.After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited according to the required format.
