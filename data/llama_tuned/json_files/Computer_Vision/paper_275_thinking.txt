To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEMI-SUPERVISED THAI SENTENCE SEGMENTATION USING LOCAL AND DISTANT WORD REPRESENTATION" by Chanatip Saetia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two Thai datasets and one English dataset, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 4) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:1. **Orchid Dataset**: This dataset is described as a Thai part-of-speech-tagged dataset containing 10,864 sentences. It is used for Thai sentence segmentation tasks.2. **UGWC Dataset**: This dataset includes labeled data for sentence segmentation tasks, generated from user-generated web content. It is also used for Thai sentence segmentation.3. **IWSLT Dataset**: This English-language dataset is used for punctuation restoration tasks, specifically for English language processing.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Orchid Dataset**, the citation is: > Virach Sornlertlamvanich, Thatsanee Charoenporn, and Hitoshi Isahara. *Orchid: Thai part-of-speech tagged corpus*. National Electronics and Computer Technology Center Technical Report (1997), 5a19.- For the **UGWC Dataset**, the citation is: > Anuruth Lertpiya, Teerapat Chaiwachirasak, Nattasit Maharattanamalai, Theerapat Lapjaturapit, Tawunrat Chalothorn, Nutcha Tirasaroj, and Ekapol Chuangsuwanich. *A preliminary study on fundamental Thai NLP tasks for user-generated web content*. 2018 International Joint Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (iSAI-NLP), IEEE, 2019, pp. 1a8.- For the **IWSLT Dataset**, the citation is: > Marcello Federico, Mauro Cettolo, Luisa Bentivogli, Paul Michael, and StA14ker Sebastian. *Overview of the IWSLT2012 evaluation campaign*. IWSLT-International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, 2012, pp. 12a33.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
