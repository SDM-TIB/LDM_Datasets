To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning a Layout Transfer Network for Context Aware Object Detection" by Tao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three datasets:1. **MIO-TCD Dataset**: This dataset is described as the largest public benchmark for object detection in traffic surveillance images, containing 110,000 images for training and 27,743 images for testing. It is used for the TSWC-2017 localization challenge.2. **Bosch Small Traffic Lights Dataset**: This dataset presents a unique challenge for detecting small objects with partial occlusions, containing 5,093 training images and 8,334 testing images.3. **KITTI Object Detection Dataset**: This dataset is noted for its comprehensive set of real-world tasks, including stereo, optical flow, visual odometry, object detection, and tracking, with 7,481 training images and 7,518 testing images.I will also check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For the **MIO-TCD Dataset**, the citation is: > Z. Luo, F. Branchaud-Charron, C. Lemaire, J. Konrad, S. Li, A. Mishra, A. Achkar, J. Eichel, and P.-M. Jodoin. *MIO-TCD: A new benchmark dataset for vehicle classification and localization*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 27(10):5129a5141, 2018.- For the **Bosch Small Traffic Lights Dataset**, the citation is: > K. Behrendt, L. Novak, and R. Botros. *A deep learning approach to traffic lights: Detection, tracking, and classification*. In ICRA, 2017, pp. 1370a1377.- For the **KITTI Object Detection Dataset**, the citation is: > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, C. Stiller, and R. Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. In IJRR, 32(11):1231a1237, 2013.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
