To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simple, Distributed, and Accelerated Probabilistic Programming" by Dustin Trana et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the implementation of probabilistic programming in a deep learning ecosystem, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **ImageNet** dataset for evaluating their model-parallel variational auto-encoder (VAE) and the **CelebA-HQ** dataset for evaluating the Image Transformer model. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:1. **ImageNet**: This dataset is used for evaluating the VAE, and they mention that they achieve state-of-the-art results on this dataset.2. **CelebA-HQ**: This dataset is used for evaluating the Image Transformer model, and they also report optimal performance on this dataset.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **ImageNet**, the citation is: > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015. https://www.image-net.org/- For **CelebA-HQ**, the citation is: > T. Karras, T. Aila, S. Laine, and J. Lehtinen. *Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018. https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09041After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
