To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Deep Context-aware Features over Body and Latent Parts for Person Re-identification" by Dangwei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive evaluations on "current challenging large-scale person ReID datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Datasets and Protocols)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:1. **Market1501**: This dataset contains 1,501 identities captured by six manually set cameras, with a total of 32,368 pedestrian images. The authors specify that 751 identities were used for training and 750 for testing.2. **CUHK03**: This dataset consists of 1,360 identities captured by six surveillance cameras, resulting in a total of 13,164 person images. The authors state that 1,260 identities were used for training and 100 for testing.3. **MARS**: The largest sequence-based person ReID dataset, containing 1,261 identities with at least two cameras. The authors mention using 625 identities for training and 631 for testing.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **Market1501**, the citation is: > L. Zheng, L. Shen, L. Tian, S. Wang, J. Wang, and Q. Tian. *Scalable person re-identiication: A benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1-8, 2015.- For **CUHK03**, the citation is: > W. Li, R. Zhao, T. Xiao, and X. Wang. *Deep reid: Deep filter pairing neural network for person re-identiication*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1-8, 2014.- For **MARS**, the citation is: > L. Zheng, Z. Bie, Y. Sun, J. Wang, C. Su, S. Wang, and Q. Tian. *MARS: A video benchmark for large-scale person re-identiication*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 1-8, 2016.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
