To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Argumentative Link Prediction using Residual Networks and Multi-Objective Learning" by Andrea Galassi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a challenging dataset consisting of user-generated comments, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges in argumentation mining and mention the use of a dataset for evaluation. In the **benchmark section**, they explicitly state that they evaluated their model against the **Cornell eRule-making Corpus (CDCP)**, which consists of 731 user comments from a eRule-making website, totaling approximately 4,700 propositions. This is a clear indication of the dataset used.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CDCP dataset. The citation is as follows:> Vlad Niculae, Joonsuk Park, and Claire Cardie. *Argument mining with structured SVMs and RNNs*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2017, Vancouver, Canada, July 30 - August 4, Volume 1:Long Papers, pages 985a995. Association for Computational Linguistics.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and citation from the paper.
