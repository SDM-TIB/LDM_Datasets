To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STN-OCR: A single Neural Network for Text Detection and Text Recognition" by Christian Bartz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and datasets used for evaluation.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly mentioned. In this paper, the authors discuss their experimental results on various benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are crucial for their evaluation.In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific dataset names and descriptions. The authors mention using the **SVHN dataset**, **ICDAR 2013 robust reading benchmark**, and the **French Street Name Signs (FSNS) dataset** for their experiments. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:1. **SVHN Dataset**: The citation is: > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/2. **ICDAR 2013 Robust Reading Benchmark**: The citation is: > D. Karatzas, F. Shafait, S. Uchida, M. Iwamura, L. G. i Bigorda, S. R. Mestre, J. Mas, D. F. Mota, J. A. Almazan, and L. P. de las Heras. *ICDAR 2013 Robust Reading Competition*. In 2013 12th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, pages 1484a1493. IEEE, 2013.3. **French Street Name Signs (FSNS) Dataset**: The citation is: > R. Smith, C. Gu, D.-S. Lee, H. Hu, R. Unnikrishnan, J. Ibarz, S. Arnoud, and S. Lin. *End-to-end interpretation of the French Street Name Signs Dataset*. In Computer Vision - ECCV 2016 Workshops, pages 411a426. Springer, Cham, 2016.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
