To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Learning of General Transformations for Data Augmentation" by Saypraseuth Mounsaveng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses data augmentation techniques and mentions that experiments were conducted on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets used:1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 70,000 training samples, 60,000 testing samples, and 10,000 test samples.2. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset of grayscale fashion articles, also containing 70,000 samples, 60,000 training samples, and 10,000 test samples.3. **SVHN**: A dataset of 32x32 pixel images of real-world color photos of house numbers, with 73,257 training samples and 26,032 test samples.4. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 10 classes of color natural images, consisting of 60,000 images, 50,000 training images, and 10,000 test images.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For **MNIST**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, LAon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278a2324, 1998.- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is: > H. Xiao, K. Rasul, and R. Vollgraf. *Fashion-mnist: an novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. 2017.- For **SVHN**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, LAon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278a2324, 1998.- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
