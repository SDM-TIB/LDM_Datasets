To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FastSpeech: Fast, Robust and Controllable Text to Speech" by Yi Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **LJSpeech dataset**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 4.1) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they conducted experiments on the **LJSpeech dataset**, which contains 13,100 English audio clips and corresponding text transcripts. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's content and its purpose in the experiments.In the **references section**, I will look for the full citation of the LJSpeech dataset. The citation is as follows:> Keith Ito. *The LJ Speech Dataset*. https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/, 2017.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the LJSpeech dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry with the necessary details, including the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
