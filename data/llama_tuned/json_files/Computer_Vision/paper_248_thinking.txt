To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rotated Word Vector Representations and their Interpretability" by Sungjoon Park, JinYeong Bak, and Alice Oh, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of rotation algorithms to word vector representations, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of evaluating the effectiveness of these methods.Next, I will focus on the **experimental settings section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **Wikipedia English articles** for training word vector models. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Wikipedia dataset. The citation for the Wikipedia dataset is:> Wikimedia Foundation. *Wikipedia English articles*. Available at: https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/20170120/404Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, ensuring to include the full citation as required. The dataset entry will include the dataset name, description, and citation.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format for further processing or review.
