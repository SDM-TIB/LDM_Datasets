To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unified Vision-Language Pre-Training for Image Captioning and VQA" by Lowei Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three datasets: **COCO Captions**, **Flickr30k Captions**, and **VQA 2.0**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the datasets as follows:1. **COCO Captions**: This dataset is used for image captioning and is noted for its large number of images and annotations.2. **Flickr30k Captions**: This dataset is also used for image captioning and is highlighted for its diverse image collection.3. **VQA 2.0**: This dataset is utilized for visual question answering and is recognized for its challenging nature.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **COCO Captions**, the citation is: > Chen, X., Fang, H., Lin, T.-Y., Vedantam, R., Gupta, S., DollÃ¡r, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2015). Microsoft coco captions: Data collection and evaluation server. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 1-8.- For **Flickr30k Captions**, the citation is: > Young, P., Lai, A., Hodosh, M., & Hockenmayer, J. (2014). From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2, 67-78.- For **VQA 2.0**, the citation is: > Goyal, Y., Khot, T., Summers-Stay, D., Batra, D., & Parikh, D. (2017). Making the V in VQA matter: Elevating the role of image understanding in visual question answering. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 6904-6913.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
