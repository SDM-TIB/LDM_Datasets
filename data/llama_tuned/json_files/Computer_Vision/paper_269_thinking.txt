To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Contextual Representations for Suicide Risk Assessment from Internet Forums" by Ashwin Karthik Ambalavanan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used data from Reddit to assess suicide risk, which suggests that a dataset related to Reddit is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the CLPsych 2019 shared task and the University of Maryland Reddit Suicidality Dataset. This is a strong indication that a specific dataset is being utilized.In the **methods section**, the authors provide more details about the dataset, stating that it was developed using data from Reddit and includes various fields such as post ID, anonymous user ID, timestamp, subreddit name, post title, and post body. This confirms the dataset's relevance and provides a clear description.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors reference the University of Maryland Reddit Suicidality Dataset, which is crucial for proper citation.The citation for the dataset is:> Zirikly A, Resnik P, Uzuner A, Hollingshead K. *CLPsych 2019 Shared Task: Predicting the Degree of Suicide Risk in Reddit Posts*. In: Proceedings of the Sixth Workshop on Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology: From Keyboard to Clinic. ; 2019.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Reddit Suicidality Dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Reddit Suicidality Dataset, ensuring that it includes all relevant details and the correct citation, ready for further processing or review.
