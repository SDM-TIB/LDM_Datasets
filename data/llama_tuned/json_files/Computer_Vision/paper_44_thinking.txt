To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Better Conversations by Modeling, Filtering, and Optimizing for Coherence and Diversity" by Xinnuo Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **OpenSubtitles corpus**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections** to gather more details about the datasets. In the introduction, the authors mention the **OpenSubtitles corpus** again, confirming its significance in their work. They also describe how they filtered this corpus to create two datasets: **OST** and **fOST**. This indicates that these datasets are derived from the OpenSubtitles corpus.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more context about the datasets. They explain that **OST** consists of training, development, and test sets, while **fOST** is a filtered version of **OST** that includes only dialogue contexts with high coherence scores. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' purpose and application in their experiments.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:- For **OpenSubtitles corpus**, the citation is: > Pierre Lison and Raveesh Meena. *OpenSubtitles 2016: Extracting Large Parallel Corpora from Movie and TV Subtitles*. In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016), Portoro≈æ, Slovenia, 2016.- For **OST** and **fOST**, since they are derived from the OpenSubtitles corpus, I will use the same citation as the OpenSubtitles corpus since they are subsets of it.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
