To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NAT: Neural Architecture Transformer for Accurate and Compact Architectures" by Yong Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations:1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset is commonly used for image classification tasks and is referenced as one of the benchmark datasets.2. **ImageNet**: Another well-known dataset for image classification, ImageNet is also mentioned as part of the experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.- For **ImageNet**, the citation is: > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248a255, 2009.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
