To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Transformer with Multi-View Visual Representation for Image Captioning" by Jun Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **MSCOCO image captioning dataset**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation process. They mention using the **MSCOCO image captioning dataset** for quantitative and qualitative evaluation, confirming its importance in their research.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the dataset, stating that it contains 83,000 training images, 40,000 validation images, and 81,000 test images, along with five captions per image. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MSCOCO dataset. The citation is as follows:> T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, L. Bourdev, R. Girshick, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, C. L. Zitnick, and P. Doll√°r. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1405.0312, 2014.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. The dataset entry will include the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
