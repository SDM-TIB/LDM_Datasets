To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weighted Transformer Network for Machine Translation" by Karim Ahmed et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed Weighted Transformer model and its performance on various machine translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention benchmarking their model on the **WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks**. This indicates that these tasks are based on specific datasets.I will also check the **related work and references sections** to find the full citations for these datasets. The WMT 2014 datasets are commonly referenced in the field of machine translation, so I will look for their citations in the references.The citations for the WMT 2014 datasets are as follows:- For **WMT 2014 English-to-German**, the citation is: > WMT 2014 English-to-German Translation Task. Available at: https://www.wmt2014.org/translation-task.html- For **WMT 2014 English-to-French**, the citation is: > WMT 2014 English-to-French Translation Task. Available at: https://www.wmt2014.org/translation-task.htmlAfter gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
