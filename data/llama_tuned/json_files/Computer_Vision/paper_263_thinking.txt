To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Theory and Experiments on Vector Quantized Autoencoders" by Aurko Roy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of VQ-VAE on datasets like CIFAR-10, indicating that datasets are indeed involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for image generation tasks. This is a strong indication that CIFAR-10 is a key dataset for their experiments.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for CIFAR-10. The citation for CIFAR-10 is:- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009. Available at: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.htmlNow that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and citation, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
