To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compressing BERT: Studying the Effects of Weight Pruning on Transfer Learning" by Mitchell A. Gordon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effects of weight pruning on transfer learning, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of pre-training and fine-tuning.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe their methodology. They mention using the **General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark**, which is a standard set of 9 tasks for natural language understanding tasks. This indicates that GLUE is a dataset used in their experiments.I will also check the **related work and conclusion sections** to see if any additional datasets are referenced. The authors discuss various pruning techniques and their effects but do not introduce new datasets in these sections.In the **experimental setup**, the authors specify that they fine-tune their models on tasks from the GLUE benchmark, which includes tasks such as sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and more. This confirms that GLUE is the primary dataset used in their experiments.Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the GLUE benchmark. The citation is as follows:> Alex Wang, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel R. Bowman. *GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-10, 2019. https://gluebenchmark.com/With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry for GLUE, ensuring to include the full citation.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
