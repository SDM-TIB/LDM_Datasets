To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STNReID: Deep Convolutional Networks with Pairwise Spatial Transformer Networks for Partial Person Re-identification" by Hao Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for evaluation.Next, I will focus on the **experimental settings section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention two specific datasets used for their experiments:1. **Partial-ReID**: This dataset is introduced as a benchmark for partial person re-identification, containing 600 images of 60 persons, with 5 full-body images and 5 partial images per person. The images were collected under various conditions, including occlusions.2. **Partial-iLIDs**: This dataset is described as a simulated partial dataset based on the iLIDs dataset. It consists of 119 persons with 238 person images captured by multiple non-overlapping cameras, used for testing purposes.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **Partial-ReID**, the citation is: > W.-S. Zheng, X. Li, T. Xiang, S. Liao, J. Lai, and S. Gong. *Partial person re-identification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2015, pp. 4678a4686.- For **Partial-iLIDs**, the citation is: > W.-S. Zheng, S. Gong, and T. Xiang. *Person re-identification by probabilistic relative distance comparison*. In Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, IEEE Computer Society, 2011, pp. 649a656.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
