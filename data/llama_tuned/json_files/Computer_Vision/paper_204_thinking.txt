To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InterBERT: Vision-and-Language Interaction for Multi-modal Pretraining" by Junyang Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a novel model for multi-modal pretraining, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, they mention three datasets for pretraining:1. **Conceptual Caption (CC)**: This dataset is used for pretraining the model and consists of paired image-text data. The authors provide a detailed description of the dataset, including the number of images and text pairs.2. **SBU Captions**: Another dataset used for pretraining, this one contains images paired with captions. The authors also provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of images and text pairs.3. **COCO Captions**: This dataset is also utilized for pretraining and is noted for its large-scale nature, containing around 5 texts per image.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **Conceptual Caption (CC)**, the citation is: > Piyush Sharma, Nan Ding, Sebastian Goodman, and Radu Soricut. *Conceptual Captions: A Cleaned, Hypernymed, Image Alt-text Dataset For Automatic Image Captioning*. In ACL 2018.- For **SBU Captions**, the citation is: > Vicente Ordonez, Girish Kulkarni, and Tamara L. Berg. *Im2Text: Describing Images Using 1 Million Captioned Photographs*. In NeurIPS 2011.- For **COCO Captions**, the citation is: > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge J. Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollAr, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In ECCV 2014.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
