To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PipeMare: Asynchronous Pipeline Parallel DNN Training" by Bowen Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the PipeMare method on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using the following datasets for their experiments:1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks.2. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification.3. **IWSLT14**: A dataset for neural machine translation tasks.4. **WMT17**: Another dataset for neural machine translation tasks.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.- For **ImageNet**, the citation is: > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.- For **IWSLT14**, the citation is: > Fair and useful benchmarks for measuring training and inference performance of ml hardware, software, and services. 2019. URL https://mlperf.org/.- For **WMT17**, the citation is: > WMT17 English-to-German translation dataset. Available at: https://www.wmt19.org/translation-datasets.htmlNow that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
