To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Transformer Networks for Node Classification on Heterogeneous Graphs" by Seongjun Yun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of heterogeneous graph datasets for node classification, indicating that datasets are likely included.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using two citation network datasets (DBLP and ACM) and a movie dataset (IMDB) for their experiments. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial for their research.I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:1. **DBLP Dataset**: The citation is: > DBLP Dataset. Available at: https://dblp.ifi.ujf.cesnet.cz/datasets/DBLP/2. **ACM Dataset**: The citation is: > ACM Dataset. Available at: https://dblp.ifi.ujf.cesnet.cz/datasets/ACM/3. **IMDB Dataset**: The citation is: > IMDB Dataset. Available at: https://www.imdb.com/Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources from the paper.
