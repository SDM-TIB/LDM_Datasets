To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoAssist: A Framework to Accelerate Training of Deep Neural Networks" by Jiong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the framework's application to deep neural networks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, particularly in the context of image classification and machine translation tasks.Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention several datasets used for image classification and machine translation tasks:1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for handwritten digit recognition and is referenced in the context of image classification.2. **FashionMNIST Dataset**: Another dataset for image classification, specifically designed for fashion item images.3. **Extended MNIST Dataset**: An extension of the MNIST dataset, which includes additional digits to increase the dataset size.4. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: A well-known dataset for image classification, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.5. **English-German ImageDescription Dataset**: Used for machine translation tasks, specifically for evaluating the proposed AutoAssist framework.6. **WMT 2014 English-German Dataset**: Another dataset for machine translation tasks, which is referenced in the context of evaluating the performance of the AutoAssist model.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For **MNIST**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010.- For **FashionMNIST**, the citation is: > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.- For **Extended MNIST**, the citation is: > Gregory Cohen, Saeed Afshar, Jonathan Tapson, and AndrA van Schaik. *EMNIST: an extension of MNIST to handwritten letters*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.05373, 2017.- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.- For **English-German ImageDescription Dataset**, the citation is: > D. Elliott, S. Frank, K. Simaaan, and L. Specia. *Multi30k: Multilingual english-german image descriptions*. pages 70a74, 2016.- For **WMT 2014 English-German Dataset**, the citation is: > D. Elliott, S. Frank, K. Simaaan, and L. Specia. *Multi30k: Multilingual english-german image descriptions*. pages 70a74, 2016.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
