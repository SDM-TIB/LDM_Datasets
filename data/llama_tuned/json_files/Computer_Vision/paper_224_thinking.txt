To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension" by Mike Lewis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the BART model's performance on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention several datasets in the context of their experiments, including:1. **SQuAD**: A dataset for extractive question answering tasks.2. **ELI5**: A dataset for long-form abstractive question answering.3. **XSum**: A dataset for news summarization.4. **ConvAI2**: A dataset for dialogue response generation.5. **CNN/DailyMail**: A dataset for news summarization.6. **MNLI**: A dataset for text classification tasks.7. **GLUE**: A multi-task benchmark for natural language understanding.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.The citations I will extract are:- For **SQuAD**, the citation is: > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.05250, 2016.- For **ELI5**, the citation is: > Angela Fan, David Grangier, and Michael Auli. *ELI5: arXiv preprint Long form question answering*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.09190, 2019.- For **XSum**, the citation is: > Shashi Narayan, Shay B Cohen, and Mirella Lapata. *Donat give me the details, just the summary! topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.08745, 2018.- For **ConvAI2**, the citation is: > Emily Dinan, Varvara Logacheva, Valentin Malykh, Alexander Miller, Kurt Shuster, Jack Urbanek, Douwe Kiela, Arthur Szlam, Iulian Serban, Ryan Lowe, et al. *ConvAI2: A conversational AI2 challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.00098, 2019.- For **CNN/DailyMail**, the citation is: > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 1693a1701, 2015.- For **MNLI**, the citation is: > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel Raman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. In Proceedings of NAACL-HLT, 2018.- For **GLUE**, the citation is: > Alex Wang, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel R Bowman. *GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.07461, 2018.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources from the paper.
