To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Semi-Supervised End-to-End Scene Text Recognition" by Christian Bartz and Haojin Yang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed method for semi-supervised scene text detection and recognition, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using standard benchmark datasets for their experiments. I will look for specific names and details about these datasets.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used:1. **SVHN Dataset**: This dataset is used to prove the feasibility of their method. It contains 600,000 images of handwritten digits, which is a common benchmark for digit recognition tasks.2. **French Street Name Signs (FSNS) Dataset**: This dataset is noted for its challenging nature, containing over 1 million images of French street name signs. It is used to evaluate the robustness of their approach against real-world scenarios.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For the **SVHN Dataset**, the citation is: > Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., & Ng, A. Y. (2011). Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, volume 2011, 5.- For the **French Street Name Signs (FSNS) Dataset**, the citation is: > Smith, R., Gu, C., Lee, D.-S., Hu, H., Unnikrishnan, R., Ibarz, J., Arnoud, S., & Lin, S. (2016). End-to-end interpretation of the French street name signs dataset. In Computer Vision - ECCV 2016 Workshops, 411a426.Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
