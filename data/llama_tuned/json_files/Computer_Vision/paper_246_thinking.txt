To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning Techniques for Humor Detection in Hindi-English Code-Mixed Tweets" by Sushmitha Reddy Sane et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a corpus for bilingual word embeddings using Twitter data, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods** sections, where the authors describe the corpus creation process. They mention that around 200k tweets are extracted using the 1000 most common words from the training corpus, which implies that this is a dataset used for training their models.In the **methods section**, the authors specify that the corpus is created from Twitter data, which is a clear indication of the dataset. They also mention that the dataset contains 3543 annotated tweets, with 1755 labeled as humorous and 1698 as non-humorous. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference a benchmark dataset published by Ankush Khandelwal et al. in 2018, which is used for evaluating the effectiveness of their proposed deep learning models. The citation for this dataset is:- For the dataset, the citation is: > Ankush Khandelwal, Sahil Swami, Syed S Akhtar, and Manish Shrivastava. *Humor detection in English-Hindi code-mixed social media content: Corpus and baseline system*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.05513, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as it is essential for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent analysis or reporting. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive dataset entry that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.
