To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expressive Graph Informer Networks" by Jaak Simm et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two prediction tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for their experiments. The introduction discusses the challenges of machine learning on molecular graphs but does not provide explicit dataset names.In the **methods section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors mention using **13C NMR spectra from NMR-ShiftDB2** for their node-level task, which is a strong indication that this is a dataset used in their experiments. I will also check the **results section** to confirm the datasets used for evaluation, particularly for the drug bioactivity prediction tasks.In the **evaluation section**, the authors explicitly state that they used **ChEMBL v23** and **Tox21** for their graph-level tasks. This confirms the datasets used for the experiments.Now, I will consult the **references section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:1. For **NMR-ShiftDB2**, the citation is: > Jonas, E., & Kuhn, S. (2019). *Rapid prediction of NMR spectral properties with quantified uncertainty*. Journal of Cheminformatics, 11(1), 1-7. https://doi.org/10.1007/s13398-019-0013-9.2. For **ChEMBL v23**, the citation is: > Bento, A. P., Gaulton, A., Hersey, A., Bellis, L. J., Chambers, J., Davies, M., KrÃ¼ger, F. A., Light, Y., Mak, L., McGlinchey, S., et al. (2014). *The ChEMBL bioactivity database: an update*. Nucleic Acids Research, 42(D1), D1083-D1090.3. For **Tox21**, the citation is: > Wu, Z., Ramsundar, B., Feinberg, E. N., Gomes, J., Geniesse, C., Pappu, A. S., Leswing, K., & Pande, V. (2018). *MoleculeNet: a benchmark for molecular machine learning*. Chemical Science, 9(2), 513-530.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
