To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep-COVID: Predicting COVID-19 From Chest X-Ray Images Using Deep Transfer Learning" by Shervin Minaee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-ray images, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **dataset description** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention that they prepared a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-ray images from publicly available datasets, specifically referencing the **COVID-Chestxray-Dataset** and the **ChexPert dataset**. This is a clear indication of the datasets used.In the **dataset description section**, the authors provide more details about the **COVID-Xray-5k dataset**, which is a combination of the **COVID-Chestxray-Dataset** and the **ChexPert dataset**. They specify that the dataset contains 2,084 training images and 3,100 test images, with a total of 5,000 images. This section confirms the datasets used for their experiments.Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **COVID-Chestxray-Dataset**, the citation is: > Cohen, Joseph Paul, Paul Morrison, and Lan Dao. *COVID-19 image data collection*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.11597, 2020.2. For the **ChexPert dataset**, the citation is: > Irvin, Jeremy, Pranav Rajpurkar, Michael Ko, Yifan Yu, Silviana Ciurea-Ilcus, Chris Chute, Henrik Marklund et al. *Chexpert: A large chest radiograph dataset with uncertainty labels and expert comparison*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, vol. 33, pages 590-597, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
