To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards a better understanding of VectorQuantized Autoencoders" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of vector quantized autoencoders (VQ-VAE) and mentions datasets like CIFAR-10 and WMT English-German, indicating that datasets are indeed involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset is commonly used for image classification tasks. The authors state that VQ-VAE achieves impressive results on this dataset, which is a well-known benchmark in the field.2. **WMT English-German**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks. The authors report their results on this dataset, confirming its significance in their experiments.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.- For **WMT English-German**, the citation is: > Aukasz Kaiser, Aurko Roy, Ashish Vaswani, Niki Pamar, Samy Bengio, Jakob Uszkoreit, and Noam Shazeer. *Fast decoding in sequence models using discrete latent variables*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.03382, 2018.Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources from the paper.
