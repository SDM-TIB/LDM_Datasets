To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rotations and Interpretability of Word Embeddings: the Case of the Russian Language" by Alexey Zobnin, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses word embeddings and their interpretability, which suggests that datasets related to word embeddings might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the author typically describes the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the author mentions training models on the **Russian Wikipedia** and **Russian books corpus**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted.In the **experiments section**, the author provides specific details about the datasets:1. **Russian Wikipedia**: This dataset is used for training the fastText skipgram models. The author mentions that the dataset is normalized and that the models are trained on the 100K vocabulary size.2. **Russian books corpus**: This dataset is used for training the RusVectA orA es models. The author specifies that the dataset is lemmatized and that the models are trained on the 10K most frequent words.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Russian Wikipedia**, the citation is: > Piotr Bojanowski, Edouard Grave, Armand Joulin, and Tomas Mikolov. *Enriching word vectors with subword information*. arXiv:1607.04606, 2016.- For the **Russian books corpus**, the citation is: > A. Kutuzov and I. Andreev. *Texts in, meaning out: Neural language models in semantic similarity tasks for Russian*. Kompajuternaja Lingvistika i Intellektualanye Tehnologii, 2(14):133a144, 2015.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
