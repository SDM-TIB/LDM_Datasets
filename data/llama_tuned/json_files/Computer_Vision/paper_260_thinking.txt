To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cybersecurity Text Analysis using Convolutional Neural Network and Conditional Random Fields" by Krishna Madgula et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a specific dataset for malware text classification, which indicates that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **dataset section** (section 2) where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention the **MalwareTextDB corpus**, which is a key dataset for their work. The authors provide details about this dataset, including its purpose and the preprocessing steps taken.In the **dataset section**, the authors specify that the **MalwareTextDB corpus** consists of APT reports describing malware reported information. They also mention that they designed an end-to-end pipeline for preprocessing the text data, which includes steps like tokenization and classification.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **MalwareTextDB corpus**. The citation is as follows:> Swee Kiat Lim, Aldrian Obaja Muis, Wei Lu, and Ong Chen Hui. *MalwareTextDB: A database for annotated malware articles*. In ACL, pages 1-8, 2017.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **MalwareTextDB corpus**. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
