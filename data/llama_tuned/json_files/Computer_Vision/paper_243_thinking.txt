To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HCTI at SemEval-2017 Task 1: Use convolutional neural network to evaluate Semantic Textual Similarity" by Yang Shao, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a convolutional neural network for the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task, which suggests that datasets related to this task may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the author mentions the datasets used for training and evaluation. Specifically, the paper states that the datasets used were from SemEval-2012, SemEval-2015, SemEval-2016, and the STS benchmark dataset. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted.In the **experiments section**, the author provides details about the datasets:1. **SemEval-2012**: This dataset is referenced multiple times, indicating its significance in the experiments.2. **SemEval-2015**: Similar to SemEval-2012, this dataset is also used for training and evaluation.3. **SemEval-2016**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the experiments, confirming its role.4. **STS Benchmark Dataset**: The author explicitly states that they used the STS benchmark dataset for evaluation, which is a well-known dataset in the STS community.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For **SemEval-2012**, the citation is: > Eneko Agirre, Carmen Banea, Claire Cardie, Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre, Weiwei Guo, Inigo Lopez-Gazpio, Montse Maritxalar, Rada Mihalcea, German Rigau, and Janyce Wiebe. *Semeval-2012 task 6: A pilot on semantic textual similarity*. In Proceedings of the First Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics, pages 385a393, 2012.- For **SemEval-2015**, the citation is: > Eneko Agirre, Carmen Banea, Claire Cardie, Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre, Weiwei Guo, Rada Mihalcea, German Rigau, and Janyce Wiebe. *Semeval-2015 task 2: Semantic textual similarity, English, Spanish and pilot on interpretability*. In Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pages 252a263, 2015.- For **SemEval-2016**, the citation is: > Eneko Agirre, Carmen Banea, Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre, Weiwei Guo, Rada Mihalcea, German Rigau, and Janyce Wiebe. *Semeval-2016 task 1: Semantic textual similarity, monolingual and cross-lingual evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pages 497a511, 2016.- For the **STS Benchmark Dataset**, the citation is: > Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Eneko Agirre, Inigo Lopez-Gazpio, and Lucia Specia. *Semeval-2017 task 1: Semantic textual similarity multilingual and crosslingual focused evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2017), pages 1a14, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
