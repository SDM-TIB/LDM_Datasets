To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KDEHatEval at SemEval-2019 Task 5: A Neural Network Model for Detecting Hate Speech in Twitter" by Umme Aymun Siddiqua et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors are evaluating their method on the **HatEval dataset**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their research.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their dataset collection process. They mention that the **HatEval dataset** is used for evaluating their proposed system. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their work.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **HatEval dataset**. The authors reference the dataset as follows:- For **HatEval**, the citation is: > Valerio Basile, Cristina Bosco, Elisabetta Fersini, Deborah Nozza, Viviana Patti, Francisco Rangel, Paolo Rosso, and Manuela Sanguinetti. *Semeval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in Twitter*. In Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), pages 365a370, 2019.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and citation, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent analysis or application of the findings.
