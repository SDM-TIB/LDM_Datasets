To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Jointly Aligning Millions of Images with Deep Penalised Reconstruction Congealing" by Roberto Annunziata et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on multiple versions of the MNIST dataset and faces from LFW, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their research.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methods. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets used:1. **MNIST**: The authors state that they evaluated their method on digits from multiple versions of MNIST, including original, perturbed, affNIST, and iniMNIST. This indicates that MNIST is a primary dataset for their experiments.2. **LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)**: The authors also mention using faces from LFW for their experiments, which is another key dataset for their research.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about how they utilized these datasets, including the specific subsets they used (e.g., affNIST and iniMNIST). This confirms the datasets' relevance to their research.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For **MNIST**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.- For **LFW**, the citation is: > Gary B Huang, Marwan Mattar, Tamara Berg, and Eric Learned-Miller. *Labeled Faces in the Wild: A Database for Studying Face Recognition in Unconstrained Environments*. In Workshop on faces in Real-Life Images: detection, alignment, and recognition, 2008.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
