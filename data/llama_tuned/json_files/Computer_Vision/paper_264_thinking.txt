To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Study of Spatial Attention Mechanisms in Deep Networks" by Xizhou Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the study of spatial attention mechanisms in deep networks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, particularly in the context of neural machine translation, object detection, and semantic segmentation.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using the following datasets:1. **COCO 2017**: This dataset is used for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. It contains images with annotations for various objects and scenes.2. **Cityscapes**: This dataset is utilized for semantic segmentation tasks, providing high-resolution images of urban scenes annotated with pixel-level segmentation masks.3. **WMT 2014**: This dataset is used for neural machine translation tasks, consisting of sentence pairs in English and German.4. **ImageNet**: This dataset is referenced as a source for pre-trained models, particularly for image classification tasks.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For **COCO 2017**, the citation is: > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, Jia Deng, and Wei Deng. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is: > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.- For **WMT 2014**, the citation is: > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.- For **ImageNet**, the citation is: > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
