To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VisualBERT: A Simple and Performant Baseline for Vision and Language" by Liunian Harold Lia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on four vision-and-language tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention four specific datasets:1. **VQA 2.0**: This dataset is used for visual question answering, consisting of over 1 million questions about images from COCO.2. **VCR**: This dataset is for visual commonsense reasoning, containing 290k questions derived from 110k movie scenes.3. **NLVR2**: This dataset is for joint reasoning about natural language and images, consisting of over 100k examples of English sentences paired with web images.4. **Flickr30K**: This dataset tests the ability of systems to ground phrases in captions to bounding regions in the image, consisting of 30k images and nearly 250k annotations.I will also check the **related work and experiments sections** for any additional datasets or references that may be relevant to the datasets mentioned.After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For **VQA 2.0**, the citation is: > Yash Goyal, Tejas Khot, Douglas Summers-Stay, Dhruv Batra, and Devi Parikh. *Making the V in VQA matter: Elevating the role of image understanding in Visual Question Answering*. In CVPR, 2017.- For **VCR**, the citation is: > Rowan Zellers, Yonatan Bisk, Ali Farhadi, and Yejin Choi. *From recognition to cognition: Visual commonsense reasoning*. In CVPR, 2019.- For **NLVR2**, the citation is: > Alane Suhr, Stephanie Zhou, Iris Zhang, Huajun Bai, and Yoav Artzi. *A corpus for reasoning about natural language grounded in photographs*. ACL, 2019.- For **Flickr30K**, the citation is: > Bryan A Plummer, Liwei Wang, Chris M Cervantes, Juan C Caicedo, Julia Hockenmaier, and Svetlana Lazebnik. *Flickr30k entities: Collecting region-to-phrase correspondences for richer image-to-sentence models*. In ICCV, 2015.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
