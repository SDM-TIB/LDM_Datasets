To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying Semantically Duplicate Questions Using Data Science Approach: A Quora Case Study" by Navedanjum Ansari and Rajesh Sharma, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **First Quora Dataset release hosted on Amazon S3**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to gather more context about the dataset. The authors mention that the dataset is used for detecting semantically duplicate questions on Quora, which reinforces its importance in their study.In the **methodology section**, specifically **section 3.1 (Data collection)**, the authors provide details about the dataset, stating that it contains **404,290 rows of question pairs** and that it is sourced from the First Quora Dataset release. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides a clear description of its contents.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:- For the **First Quora Dataset**, the citation is: > Navedanjum Ansari and Rajesh Sharma. *Identifying Semantically Duplicate Questions Using Data Science Approach: A Quora Case Study*. In Proceedings of ACM Conference, 2019. [DOI: 10.1145/...].Since the dataset is hosted on Amazon S3, I will note that the dataset is available at: > Amazon S3: https://s3.amazonaws.com/quora-dataset-release/After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation and the description provided in the paper. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their sources for future reference.
