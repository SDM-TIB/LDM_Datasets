To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial Transformer for 3D Point Clouds" by Jiayun Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of spatial transformers for 3D point clouds, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of segmentation and classification tasks.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets. The introduction provides a brief overview of the challenges in 3D point cloud processing and hints at the datasets used for evaluation, but I need to look for more detailed information in the methods and experiments sections.In the **methods section**, the authors mention using the **ShapeNet part segmentation dataset** for part segmentation tasks. This is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their experiments. I will look for more details about this dataset in the **experiments section**.The **experiments section** confirms the use of the **ShapeNet part segmentation dataset** and also mentions the **ModelNet40 3D shape classification dataset** for classification tasks. Additionally, the authors refer to the **KITTI 3D object detection dataset** for object detection tasks.Now, I will check the **references section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:1. For **ShapeNet part segmentation dataset**, the citation is: > A. X. Chang, T. Funkhouser, L. Guibas, P. Hanrahan, Q. Huang, Z. Li, S. Savarese, M. Savva, S. Song, H. Su, et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.2. For **ModelNet40 3D shape classification dataset**, the citation is: > Z. Wu, S. Song, A. Khosla, F. Yu, L. Zhang, X. Tang, and J. Xiao. *3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1912a1920, 2015.3. For **KITTI 3D object detection dataset**, the citation is: > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R. Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354a3361, 2012.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
