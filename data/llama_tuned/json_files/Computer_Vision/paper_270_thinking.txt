To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-Memory Neural Network Training: A Technical Report" by Nimit S. Sohoni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses memory-efficient training techniques but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more details.In the **introduction**, the authors mention using two representative deep learning benchmarks: **CIFAR-10** for image classification and **IWSLTa14** for machine translation. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used. The authors explicitly state that they run experiments on these two datasets:1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training and 10,000 test images, with inputs of 32x32 RGB images and labels for 10 classes.2. **IWSLTa14**: This dataset is used for machine translation, containing 160K sentence pairs for German to English translation.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.- For **IWSLTa14**, the citation is: > Mauro Cettolo, Jan Niehues, Sebastian StA uker, Luisa Bentivogli, and Marcello Federico. *Report on the 11th IWSLT evaluation campaign*. In International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT), 2014.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
