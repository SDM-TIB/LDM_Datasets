To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptively Sparse Transformers" by GonÃ§alo Correia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the adaptively sparse Transformer model and its performance on machine translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention four machine translation datasets:1. **IWSLT 2017 German a English**: This dataset consists of 200K sentence pairs and is used for training the model.2. **CET-A KFTT Japanese a English**: This dataset contains 300K sentence pairs and is also used for training.3. **WMT 2016 Romanian a English**: This dataset includes 600K sentence pairs and serves as another training dataset.4. **WMT 2014 English a German**: This dataset comprises 4.5M sentence pairs, which is the largest dataset mentioned for training the model.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **IWSLT 2017 German a English**, the citation is: > M. Cettolo, M. Federico, L. Bentivogli, J. Niehues, S. StAuker, K. Sudoh, K. Yoshino, and C. Federmann. *Overview of the IWSLT 2017 evaluation campaign*. In Proceedings of the IWSLT, 2017.- For **CET-A KFTT Japanese a English**, the citation is: > Graham Neubig. *The Kyoto free translation task*. Available at: http://www.phontron.com/kftt.- For **WMT 2016 Romanian a English**, the citation is: > Ondrej Bojar, Rajen Chatterjee, Christian Federmann, Yvette Graham, Barry Haddow, Matthias Huck, Antonio Jimeno Yepes, Philipp Koehn, Varvara Logacheva, Christof Monz, et al. *Findings of the 2016 conference on machine translation*. In Proceedings of the 2016 conference on machine translation, 2016.- For **WMT 2014 English a German**, the citation is: > Ondrej Bojar, Christian Buck, Christian Federmann, Barry Haddow, Philipp Koehn, Johannes Leveling, Christof Monz, Pavel Pecina, Matt Post, Herve Saint-Amand, et al. *Findings of the 2014 workshop on statistical machine translation*. In Proceedings of the 2014 workshop on statistical machine translation, 2014.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
