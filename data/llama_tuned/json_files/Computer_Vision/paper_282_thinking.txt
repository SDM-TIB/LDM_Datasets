To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AriEL: volume coding for sentence generation" by Luca Celotti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors benchmark their method on a toy grammar and a real dataset of human dialogues, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically the subsection titled **Datasets**. Here, the authors describe two datasets:1. **Toy Dataset**: This dataset is generated from a context-free grammar (CFG) and consists of sentences framed as questions about objects. The authors specify that the vocabulary consists of 840 words, and the dataset is split into training, test, and validation sets.2. **Real Dataset**: The authors refer to the **GuessWhat?! dataset**, which is a dataset of sentences asked by humans to humans to solve a cooperative game. This dataset features a vocabulary of 10,469 words and is also split into training, test, and validation sets.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **GuessWhat?! dataset**, the citation is: > H. De Vries, F. Strub, S. Chandar, O. Pietquin, H. Larochelle, and A. C. Courville. *Guesswhat?! visual object discovery through multi-modal dialogue*. In IEEE CPVR, vol. 1, no. 2, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
