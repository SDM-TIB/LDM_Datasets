To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classification based Grasp Detection using Spatial Transformer Network" by Dongwon Park and Se Young Chun, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of robotic grasp detection and hints at the use of datasets for training and evaluation, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**, particularly the subsection titled "A. Dataset." Here, the authors explicitly mention the **Cornell Grasp Detection Dataset**. They describe it as containing 855 images (RGB color and depth) of 240 different objects with ground truth labels for graspable rectangles and non-graspable rectangles. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's purpose and its contents.In the **References section**, I will look for the full citation of the Cornell Grasp Detection Dataset. The relevant citation is:- For the **Cornell Grasp Detection Dataset**, the citation is: > I. Lenz, H. Lee, and A. Saxena. *Deep learning for detecting robotic grasps*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 34, no. 4-5, pp. 705a724, Apr. 2015.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation from the paper.
