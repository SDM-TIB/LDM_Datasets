To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Semi-supervised Aspect-term Sentiment Analysis via Transformer" by Xingyi Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of aspect-term sentiment analysis and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled **Datasets and Preparation**. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:1. **REST Dataset**: This dataset contains reviews from the restaurant domain, with a total of 215,973 labeled samples and 98,034 unlabeled samples. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of positive, negative, and neutral samples.2. **LAPTOP Dataset**: This dataset consists of reviews for laptop products, containing 34,040 labeled samples and 128,171 unlabeled samples. Similar to the REST dataset, the authors provide statistics for this dataset as well.In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For the **REST Dataset**, the citation is: > Pontiki, M., Galanis, D., Pavlopoulos, J., Androutsopoulos, I., & Papageorgiou, H. (2014). *Semeval-2014 task 4: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval@COLING 2014, Dublin, Ireland, August 23-24, 2014, pages 27a35.- For the **LAPTOP Dataset**, the citation is: > Pontiki, M., Galanis, D., Pavlopoulos, J., Androutsopoulos, I., & Papageorgiou, H. (2014). *Semeval-2014 task 4: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval@COLING 2014, Dublin, Ireland, August 23-24, 2014, pages 27a35.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
