To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing One-Shot Grasp Detection based on Robustness Classifier" by Alexandre Gari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **Dex-Net 2.0 dataset** for training their model, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of training detection networks on sparse datasets and mention the **Dex-Net 2.0 dataset** again, confirming its importance. In the **experiments section**, they explicitly state that they used the **Dex-Net 2.0 dataset** for training their one-shot grasp detection model, which reinforces its role in their work.I will also check the **related work section** to see if any other datasets are mentioned. However, the primary focus remains on **Dex-Net 2.0**.Now, I will look at the **datasets section** (if present) or any relevant sections that detail the datasets used. The authors describe the **Dex-Net 2.0 dataset** in detail, providing information about its size (6.7 million grasps) and the sources of the 3D models used. This section confirms that **Dex-Net 2.0** is the primary dataset utilized in their experiments.Next, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Dex-Net 2.0 dataset**. The citation is as follows:> Mahler, J., Liang, J., Niyaz, S., Laskey, M., Doan, R., Liu, X., Ojea, J. A., & Goldberg, K. (2017). *Dex-Net 2.0: Deep Learning to Plan Robust Grasps with Synthetic Point Clouds and Analytic Grasp Metrics*. In RSS, 2017.Since the paper primarily focuses on the **Dex-Net 2.0 dataset**, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. The dataset details include:1. **Dex-Net 2.0 Dataset**: A large-scale simulated dataset for parallel-gripper grasping, containing 6.7 million grasps on pre-rendered depth images of 3D models sourced from 3DNet and laser scans from KIT. The dataset includes 32 Ã— 32 depth images of grasp candidates with associated grasp robustness metrics.After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for **Dex-Net 2.0** with the full citation, ensuring that it is ready for any further analysis or reporting.
