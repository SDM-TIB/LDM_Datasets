To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalizing Spatial Transformers to Projective Geometry with Applications to 2D/3D Registration" by Cong Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method to 2D/3D registration, which suggests that datasets related to medical imaging are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors mention using **17 full body CT scans from the NIH Cancer Imaging Archive** for training their algorithm. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more details about the dataset, stating that they cropped the CT scans to the pelvis cubic region and downsampled them to a size of 128 × 128 × 128. This confirms the dataset's relevance and its application in their experiments.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the NIH Cancer Imaging Archive. The relevant citation is:- For the **NIH Cancer Imaging Archive**, the citation is: > Roth, H.R., Lu, L., Sei, A., Cherry, K.M., Hoiman, J., Wang, S., Liu, J., Turkbey, E., Summers, R.M. *A new 2.5 d representation for lymph node detection using random sets of deep convolutional neural network observations*. In International conference on medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention, pp. 520a527. Springer, 2014.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and its citation from the paper.
