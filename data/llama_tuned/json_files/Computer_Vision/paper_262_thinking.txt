To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Music theme recognition using CNN and self-attention" by Manoj Sukhavasi and Sainath Adapa, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **MTG-Jamendo dataset** for their experiments, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their research.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the task of automatic music tagging and mention the **MTG-Jamendo dataset** again, confirming its significance in their work. This reinforces that the dataset is central to their approach.In the **methods section**, the authors describe their approach and the datasets used for training and evaluation. They specifically mention using the **autotagging-moodtheme subset of the MTG-Jamendo dataset** for their experiments. This indicates that this dataset is not only used but also detailed in their methodology.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **MTG-Jamendo dataset**. The relevant citation is:- For the **MTG-Jamendo dataset**, the citation is: > Dmitry Bogdanov, Minz Won, Philip Tovstogan, Alastair Porter, and Xavier Serra. *The MTG-Jamendo Dataset for Automatic Music Tagging*. In Machine Learning for Music Discovery Workshop, International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2019). Long Beach, CA, United States. http://hdl.handle.net/10230/42015Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **MTG-Jamendo dataset**. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
