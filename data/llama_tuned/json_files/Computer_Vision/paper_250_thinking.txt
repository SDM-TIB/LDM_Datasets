To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identity-preserving Face Recovery from Portraits" by Fatemeh Shiri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors synthesized a large-scale dataset of real and stylized face pairs, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **synthesized dataset and preprocessing section**. Here, the authors describe the creation of a large-scale dataset of stylized and photorealistic face pairs. They mention using the **CelebA dataset** for this purpose, which is a well-known dataset in the field of face attributes.In the **experiments section**, the authors refer to the **synthesized dataset** again, confirming its use for training and testing their method. They also mention using the **CUFSF dataset** for evaluating their results, particularly for face sketch recognition.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **CelebA dataset**, the citation is: > Z. Liu, P. Luo, X. Wang, and X. Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In ICCV, 2015.2. For the **CUFSF dataset**, the citation is: > P. J. Phillips, H. Wechsler, J. Huang, and P. J. Rauss. *The FERET database and evaluation procedure for face recognition algorithms*. Image and Vision Computing, 16(5):295a306, 1998.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
