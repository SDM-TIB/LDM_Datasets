To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ST-GAN: Spatial Transformer Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Compositing" by Chen-Hsuan Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a synthetic dataset for image compositing, which indicates that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:1. **3D Cubes Dataset**: This dataset is created for validating the effectiveness of the proposed method in a synthetic setting. It consists of 3D cube renderings and perturbations to test geometric corrections.2. **SUNCG Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for training and evaluating the model in the context of image compositing. It contains indoor scenes and 3D object instances from various categories.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **3D Cubes Dataset**, the citation is: > Chen-Hsuan Lin, Ersin Yumer, and Oliver Wang. *ST-GAN: Spatial Transformer Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Compositing*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.- For the **SUNCG Dataset**, the citation is: > S. Song, F. Yu, A. Zeng, A. X. Chang, M. Savva, and T. Funkhouser. *Semantic Scene Completion from a Single Depth Image*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
