To extract datasets from the research paper titled "adVAE: a Self-adversarial Variational Autoencoder with Gaussian Anomaly Prior Knowledge for Anomaly Detection" by Xuhong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, so I will look for specific names and details.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that describe the datasets used. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant statistics. I will look for tables or lists that summarize the datasets, as they often provide concise information about each dataset.In this paper, the authors mention using five publicly available and widely used tabular anomaly detection datasets. I will extract the following datasets:1. **Letter Dataset**: This dataset is used for anomaly detection tasks. It contains 1600 letters with 18 features, and the authors specify that 80% of the normal data was used for training, while the remaining 20% and all outliers were used for testing.2. **Cardio Dataset**: This dataset is also used for anomaly detection and contains 315 samples with 18 features. The authors state that 80% of the normal data was used for training, and the remaining 20% and all outliers were used for testing.3. **Satellite Dataset**: This dataset consists of 100 samples with 18 features and follows the same training and testing split as the other datasets.4. **Optical Dataset**: This dataset contains 521 samples with 18 features and is used for anomaly detection. The authors specify that 80% of the normal data was used for training, and the remaining 20% and all outliers were used for testing.5. **Pen Dataset**: This dataset has 100 samples with 18 features and is utilized for anomaly detection. The authors mention that 80% of the normal data was used for training, and the remaining 20% and all outliers were used for testing.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:- For the **Letter Dataset**, the citation is: > S. Rayana, L. Akoglu. *Less is more: Building selective anomaly ensembles*. ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery of Data, 10(4):42:1a42:33, 2016.- For the **Cardio Dataset**, the citation is: > S. Sathe, C. C. Aggarwal. *LODES: Local density meets spectral outlier detection*. In SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM), SIAM, 2016, pp. 171a179.- For the **Satellite Dataset**, the citation is: > F. T. Liu, K. M. Ting, Z. Zhou. *Isolation forest*. In International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM), IEEE, 2008, pp. 413a422.- For the **Optical Dataset**, the citation is: > C. C. Aggarwal, S. Sathe. *Theoretical foundations and algorithms for outlier ensembles*. SIGKDD Exploratory Newsl., 17(1):24a47, 2015.- For the **Pen Dataset**, the citation is: > F. Keller, E. M. Müller, K. Böhnm, H. I. C. Böhnm. *HICS: High contrast subspaces for density-based outlier ranking*. In International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), IEEE, 2012, pp. 1037a1048.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
