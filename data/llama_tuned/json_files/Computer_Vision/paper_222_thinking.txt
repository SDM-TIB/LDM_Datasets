To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Patch Matching Using Convolutional Descriptors with Euclidean Distance" by Iaroslav Melekhov, Juho Kannala, and Esa Rahtu, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments with the **Multi-view Stereo Correspondence (MSC) dataset**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to gather more details about the MSC dataset. The authors describe it as consisting of more than 1.5 million grayscale patches extracted from images of the Statue of Liberty, Notre Dame, and Half Dome. This provides a clear understanding of the dataset's purpose and content.In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used the MSC dataset for training and evaluation of their proposed descriptor. They mention that the dataset consists of pairs of matching and non-matching patches, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's application in their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MSC dataset. The citation is as follows:> Hua, G., Brown, M., Winder, S. *Discriminant learning of local image descriptors*. In Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on, 2010.Since the MSC dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and citation.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MSC dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or processing.
