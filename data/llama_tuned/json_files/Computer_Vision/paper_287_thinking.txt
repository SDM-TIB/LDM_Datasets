To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoToon: Automatic Geometric Warping for Face Cartoon Generation" by Julia Gong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce a new method for generating cartoons, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly those related to caricature generation.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **dataset section**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of caricature generation and mention the need for high-quality datasets. In the **dataset section**, they explicitly state that they created a new dataset called **AutoToon**, which consists of paired images of human facial portrait photos and their corresponding geometrically warped cartoons by trained artists. This is a significant finding, as it indicates that the authors have created a dataset specifically for their research.I will also check the **experiments section** to see if they reference any external datasets used for evaluation or comparison. However, the primary dataset mentioned is the **AutoToon dataset**, which is the focus of their work.Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the **AutoToon dataset**. The authors do not provide a separate citation for the dataset in the references, but they mention that the dataset is a paired dataset of human facial portrait photos and their corresponding geometrically warped cartoons. Since this dataset is original to their research, I will note that it does not have a formal citation like traditional datasets.Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will compile the information about the **AutoToon dataset** as follows:- **AutoToon Dataset**: This dataset consists of 101 paired images of human facial portrait photos and their corresponding geometrically warped cartoons by trained artists. The dataset is created for the purpose of this research.Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information in the required format, ensuring that I include the description and citation for the **AutoToon dataset**.
