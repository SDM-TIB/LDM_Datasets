To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-Shot Learning via Embedding Adaptation with Set-to-Set Functions" by Han-Jia Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for evaluation.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a dedicated subsection that details the datasets. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, including:1. **MiniImageNet**: This dataset is described as containing 100 classes with 600 examples per class, used for evaluating few-shot learning methods.2. **TieredImageNet**: This dataset is noted for its large scale, containing 351, 97, and 160 categories for training, validation, and evaluation, respectively.3. **CUB Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 11,788 images of birds across 200 species, with specific splits for training, validation, and evaluation.4. **OfficeHome Dataset**: This dataset is used to validate the generalization ability of the proposed method across domains, consisting of four domains with 8722 images.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For **MiniImageNet**, the citation is: > O. Vinyals, C. Blundell, T. Lillicrap, K. Kavukcuoglu, and D. Wierstra. *Matching networks for one shot learning*. In NIPS, pages 3630a3638, 2016.- For **TieredImageNet**, the citation is: > M. Ren, E. Triantaillou, S. Ravi, J. Snell, K. Swersky, J. B. Tenenbaum, H. Larochelle, and R. S. Zemel. *Meta-learning for semi-supervised few-shot classification*. In ICLR, 2018.- For **CUB Dataset**, the citation is: > C. Wah, S. Branson, P. Welinder, P. Perona, and S. Belongie. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology, 2011.- For **OfficeHome Dataset**, the citation is: > H. Venkateswara, J. Eusebio, S. Chakraborty, and S. Panchanathan. *Deep hashing network for unsupervised domain adaptation*. In CVPR, pages 5385a5394, 2017.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
