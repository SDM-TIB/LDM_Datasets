To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multistage Model for Robust Face Alignment Using Deep Neural Networks" by Huabin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on challenging benchmark datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed used.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention three datasets:1. **300-W Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for face alignment tasks and consists of 3148 images with 68 landmark annotations. It includes a training set, a common set, a challenge set, and a full set.2. **300-W Private Test Set**: This dataset is a variant of the 300-W dataset, containing 300 indoor images and 300 outdoor images, also annotated with 68 landmarks.3. **COFW Dataset**: This dataset focuses on occlusion in natural images, containing 1345 training images and 507 testing images, each annotated with 29 landmarks.4. **WFLW Dataset**: Considered the most challenging dataset, it includes 10000 faces with 98 fully annotated landmarks and corresponding facial bounding boxes, providing rich attribute annotations.Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **300-W Dataset**, the citation is: > C. Sagonas, G. Tzimiropoulos, S. Zafeiriou, and M. Pantic. *300 faces in-the-wild challenge: The first facial landmark localization challenge*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, 2013, pp. 397a403.- For the **300-W Private Test Set**, the citation is: > C. Sagonas, E. Antonakos, G. Tzimiropoulos, S. Zafeiriou, and M. Pantic. *300 faces in-the-wild challenge: Database and results*. Image and Vision Computing, 47:3a18, 2016.- For the **COFW Dataset**, the citation is: > X. P. Burgos-Artizzu, P. Perona, and P. DollÃ¡r. *Robust face landmark estimation under occlusion*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2013, pp. 1513a1520.- For the **WFLW Dataset**, the citation is: > J. Yang, Q. Liu, and K. Zhang. *Stacked hourglass network for robust facial landmark localization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, 2017, pp. 79a87.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
