To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explicit Disentanglement of Appearance and Perspective in Generative Models" by Nicki S. Detlefsen and SÃ¸ren Hauberg, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on four datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention four datasets:1. **dSprites**: This dataset is used for disentanglement testing, specifically designed for evaluating disentanglement algorithms.2. **MNIST**: The authors use MNIST for disentanglement of style and content, where they artificially augment the dataset to make the task more challenging.3. **SMPL**: This dataset is utilized for disentanglement of body shape and pose, containing synthetic images of human bodies generated by the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL).4. **CelebA**: The authors evaluate their model on the CelebA dataset, which is used for disentanglement of facial features and facial shape.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **dSprites**, the citation is: > Loper, M., Mahmood, N., Romero, J., Pons-Moll, G., & Black, M. J. (2015). *SMPL: A skinned multi-person linear model*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (Proc. SIGGRAPH Asia), 34(6), 248:1a248:16. http://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/- For **MNIST**, the citation is: > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11), 2278a2324.- For **SMPL**, the citation is the same as above since it is referenced in the same paper.- For **CelebA**, the citation is: > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
