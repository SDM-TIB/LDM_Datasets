To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Transformer Networks for Semantic Correspondence" by Seungryong Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of recurrent transformer networks for semantic correspondence, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on several benchmarks, specifically:1. **TSS Benchmark**: This dataset consists of 400 image pairs divided into three groups: FG3D Car, JODS, and PASCAL. The authors provide details about the number of image pairs and the categories involved.2. **PF-WILLOW Benchmark**: This dataset includes 10 object classes with 10 keypoint annotations for each image. The authors describe the structure and the evaluation metric used for this dataset.3. **PF-PASCAL Benchmark**: This dataset contains 1,351 image pairs over 20 object categories with PASCAL keypoint annotations. The authors provide details about the number of image pairs and the categories involved.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **TSS Benchmark**, the citation is: > T. Taniai, S. N. Sinha, and Y. Sato. *Joint recovery of dense correspondence and cosegmentation in two images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1-8, 2016.- For the **PF-WILLOW Benchmark**, the citation is: > B. Ham, M. Cho, C. Schmid, and J. Ponce. *Proposal flow*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1-8, 2016.- For the **PF-PASCAL Benchmark**, the citation is: > B. Ham, M. Cho, C. Schmid, and J. Ponce. *Proposal flow: Semantic correspondences from object proposals*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 39(1):1-8, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
