To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Semi-Supervised End-to-End Scene Text Recognition" by Christian Bartz and Haojin Yang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed method for scene text detection and recognition, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, particularly in the context of evaluating the proposed system.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using standard benchmark datasets for their experiments. I will look for specific names of datasets and any details about their characteristics.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:1. **SVHN Dataset**: This dataset is used to prove the feasibility of their method. It contains images of house numbers, which are used for text detection and recognition tasks.2. **French Street Name Signs (FSNS) Dataset**: This dataset is noted for its challenging nature, containing images of street signs with multiple lines of text and varying lengths, making it difficult for the model to recognize.3. **Generated Datasets**: The authors also mention generating additional datasets based on the SVHN dataset, which are used to evaluate the performance of their model on images with multiple words.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **SVHN Dataset**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/- For the **French Street Name Signs (FSNS) Dataset**, the citation is: > R. Smith, C. Gu, D.-S. Lee, H. Hu, R. Unnikrishnan, J. Ibarz, S. Arnoud, and S. Lin. *End-to-end interpretation of the French street name signs dataset*. In Computer Vision - ECCV 2016 Workshops, 411a426. Springer, Cham, 2016. Available: https://bartzi.de/research/see- For the **Generated Datasets**, since they are based on the SVHN dataset, I will use the same citation as the SVHN dataset.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
