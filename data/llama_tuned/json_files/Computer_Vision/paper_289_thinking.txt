To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FASPell: A Fast, Adaptable, Simple, Powerful Chinese Spell Checker Based On DAE-Decoder Paradigm" by Yuzhong Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the model's capabilities but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention several benchmark datasets for Chinese spell checking, including:1. **SIGHAN13 - 15 shared tasks on Chinese spell checking**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of spell checking models.2. **SIGHAN 2014 bake-off for Chinese spelling check**: This dataset is another benchmark for evaluating spell checking models.3. **OCR data set**: The authors mention harvesting 4575 sentences from OCR results of Chinese subtitles in videos, which is a unique dataset for their experiments.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **SIGHAN13 - 15 shared tasks on Chinese spell checking**, the citation is: > Shi-Hung Wu, Chao-Lin Liu, and Lung-Hao Lee. *Chinese spelling check evaluation at SIGHAN bake-off 2013*. In Proceedings of the Seventh SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing, pages 35a42, Nagoya, Japan, 2013.- For **SIGHAN 2014 bake-off for Chinese spelling check**, the citation is: > Zhilin Yang, Zihang Dai, Yiming Yang, Jaime Carbonell, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and Quoc V Le. *Spell checking for Chinese*. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LRECa12), Istanbul, Turkey, 2012.- For **OCR data set**, the citation is: > Baoguang Shi, Xiang Bai, and Cong Yao. *An end-to-end trainable neural network for image-based sequence recognition and its application to scene text recognition*. IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence, 39(11):2298a2304, 2017.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
