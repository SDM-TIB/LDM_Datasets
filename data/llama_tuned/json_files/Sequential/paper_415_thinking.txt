To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Code Completion using Neural Attention and Byte Pair Encoding" by Youyi Arkesteijn et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, data acquisition and generation, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.Next, I will focus on the **data acquisition and generation section**. Here, the authors mention using the **SRI labas 150k Python Dataset** as the basis for their prediction task. This is a clear indication that this dataset is central to their experiments.I will also check the **evaluation section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors refer to the SRI labas 150k Python Dataset in the context of their results. If they compare their models against other datasets, I will note those as well.After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citation for the SRI labas 150k Python Dataset. The citation is as follows:> SRI International. *SRI labas 150k Python Dataset*. Available at: https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/py150kNow that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and citation from the paper.
