To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Retroitting Contextualized Word Embeddings with Paraphrases" by Weijia Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for robust contextualized word embeddings and hints at the use of paraphrase datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three paraphrase datasets:1. **MRPC (Dolan et al., 2004)**: This dataset contains 2,753 paraphrase pairs used for paraphrase identification tasks.2. **Sampled Quora (Iyer et al., 2017)**: This dataset includes 20,000 paraphrased question pairs, which are randomly sampled from Quora.3. **PAN (Madnani et al., 2012)**: This dataset contains 5,000 paraphrase pairs used for paraphrase identification tasks.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For **MRPC**, the citation is: > Bill Dolan, Chris Quirk, and Chris Brockett. *Unsupervised construction of large paraphrase corpora: Exploiting massively parallel news sources*. In COLING, 2004.- For **Sampled Quora**, the citation is: > Shankar Iyer, Nikhil Dandekar, and KornA el Csernai. *First Quora dataset release: Question pairs*. data.quora.com, 2017.- For **PAN**, the citation is: > Nitin Madnani, Joel Tetreault, and Martin Chodorow. *Re-examining machine translation metrics for paraphrase identification*. In NAACL, 2012.Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
