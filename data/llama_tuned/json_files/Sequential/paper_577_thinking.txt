To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NCUEE at MEDIQA 2019: Medical Text Inference Using Ensemble BERT-BiLSTM-Attention Model" by Lung-Hao Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the MEDIQA challenge, which suggests that datasets related to this challenge may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the MEDIQA challenge and mention the datasets used for their experiments. They specifically reference the **MedNLI dataset**, which is annotated by doctors and grounded in patients' medical histories, indicating its significance in the clinical domain. This dataset is crucial for their NLI tasks.In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for training and testing their model. They mention that the training, validation, and test datasets were comprised of sentence pairs from the **MedNLI dataset**. This confirms the dataset's role in their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **MedNLI dataset**. The citation is as follows:> Alexey Romanov and Chaitanya Shivade. *Lessons from natural language inference in the clinical domain*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1586-1596, 2018. https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1187Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MedNLI dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MedNLI dataset, ensuring that it includes all necessary details and the correct citation, ready for further processing or review.
