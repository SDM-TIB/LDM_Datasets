To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BERT-AL: BERT for Arbitrarily Long Document Understanding" by Jimmy Lei Ba et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. In section 4.1, they explicitly mention the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset** and describe its contents, including the number of training, validation, and testing samples. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides essential details about its structure.In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they used the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset** for their experiments, which includes news articles and associated highlights. They also mention that they performed the same preprocessing steps as BERTSUM, which further emphasizes the dataset's importance.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**. The citation is as follows:> Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend neural information processing systems*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 1693a1701, 2015.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CNN/Daily Mail dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, ensuring that it includes all relevant details and the correct citation.
