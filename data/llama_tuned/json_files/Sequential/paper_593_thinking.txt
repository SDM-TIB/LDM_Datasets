To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Odd-Man-Out: Exploring the Associative Power of Lexical Resources" by Gabriel Stanovsky and Mark Hopkins, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the Odd-Man-Out task and mentions the creation of several datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the Odd-Man-Out task and its evaluation, but they do not specify the datasets yet. I will need to look deeper into the paper for more detailed descriptions.In the **methods section**, the authors describe the creation of several Odd-Man-Out datasets. They mention the following datasets:1. **ANOMIACOMMONDEV**: This dataset is derived from the card game Anomia, containing 404 puzzles created by a team of annotators. It is used for evaluating the Odd-Man-Out task.2. **ANOMIACOMMONTEST**: Another dataset from the same source as ANOMIACOMMONDEV, this one contains 202 puzzles for testing purposes.3. **ANOMIAPROPERDEV**: This dataset is similar to ANOMIACOMMONDEV but contains puzzles related to proper nouns.4. **ANOMIAPROPERTEST**: This dataset is used for testing the Odd-Man-Out task, containing 102 puzzles.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets, but I can infer that they are derived from the Anomia card game, which is a well-known source for such datasets. The citation for the Anomia game is:> Board Game Geek. *Anomia*. Available at: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/142271/anomia-party-editionSince the datasets are derived from the Anomia game, I will use this citation as the basis for all datasets mentioned in the paper.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the Anomia game as the source of the datasets. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
