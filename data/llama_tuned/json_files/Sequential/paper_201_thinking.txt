To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language Modeling with Gated Convolutional Networks" by Yann N. Dauphin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on two large-scale language modeling datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 4.1), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they describe two datasets:1. **Google Billion Word Dataset**: This dataset is noted for being one of the largest language modeling datasets, containing almost one billion tokens and a vocabulary of over 800K words. The authors mention that words appearing less than 3 times are replaced with a special unknown symbol.2. **WikiText-103 Dataset**: This dataset is described as a smaller dataset with over 100M tokens and a vocabulary of about 200K words. The sentences in this dataset are consecutive, allowing models to condition on larger contexts rather than single sentences.In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Google Billion Word Dataset**, the citation is: > Ciprian Chelba, Tomas Mikolov, Mike Schuster, Qi Ge, Thorsten Brants, Philipp Koehn, and Tony Robinson. *One billion word benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.3005, 2013.- For the **WikiText-103 Dataset**, the citation is: > S. Merity, C. Xiong, J. Bradbury, and R. Socher. *Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models*. ArXiv e-prints, September 2016.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
