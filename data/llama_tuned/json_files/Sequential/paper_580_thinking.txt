To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation of vector embedding models in clustering of text documents" by Tomasz Walkowiak and Mateusz Gniewkowski, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated word embedding models on two corpora of text documents in Polish, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two corpora:1. **P ress**: This corpus consists of Polish press news articles, which are categorized into subject groups. The authors mention that there are approximately 6,500 documents in this dataset, and they achieved a 95.5% accuracy in supervised classification.2. **Rewievs**: This corpus contains reviews of scientific works from 21 different science areas. The authors report an accuracy of 90.7% in supervised classification using the fastText model, with a total of 10,500 documents in this dataset.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **P ress**, the citation is: > Tomasz Walkowiak and Piotr Malak. *In Pro-ish texts topic classification evaluation*. Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence - Volume 2: ICAART, pages 515a522, 2018. https://doi.org/10.5220/0006601605150522.- For **Rewievs**, the citation is: > Andrew Y Ng, Michael I Jordan, and Yair Weiss. *On spectral clustering: Analysis and an algorithm*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 849a856, 2002.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
