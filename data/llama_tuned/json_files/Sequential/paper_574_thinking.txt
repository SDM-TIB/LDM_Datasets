To extract datasets from the research paper titled "context2vec: Learning Generic Context Embedding with Bidirectional LSTM" by Oren Melamud et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the context representations and mentions the use of large corpora, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention several datasets used for their experiments, including:1. **ukWaC**: This dataset is used for training the context2vec model. It is described as a very large web-derived corpus of English, containing approximately 2 billion words.2. **Senseval-3**: This dataset is utilized for the supervised word sense disambiguation task. It includes 7,860 training instances and 3,944 test instances.3. **MSCC (Microsoft Sentence Completion Challenge)**: This dataset is used for the sentence completion task, consisting of 1,040 items, each representing a sentence with a missing word.4. **LST-07**: This dataset is part of the SemEval 2007 task and is used for lexical substitution. It contains 300 development sentences and 1,710 test sentences.5. **LST-14**: This dataset is a more recent lexical substitution corpus, containing over 15,000 target word instances with a 35% to 65% split for development and testing.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For **ukWaC**, the citation is: > Adriano Ferraresi, Eros Zanchetta, Marco Baroni, and Silvia Bernardini. *Introducing and evaluating ukwac, a very large web-derived corpus of English*. In Proceedings of the 4th Web as Corpus Workshop (WAC-4), 2008.- For **Senseval-3**, the citation is: > Rada Mihalcea, Timothy Anatolievich Chklovski, and Adam Kilgarriff. *The senseval-3 english lexical sample task*. In Proceedings of ACL, 2004.- For **MSCC**, the citation is: > Geoffrey Zweig and Christopher JC Burges. *The Microsoft research sentence completion challenge*. Technical Report MSR-TR-2011-129, Microsoft, 2011.- For **LST-07**, the citation is: > Diana McCarthy and Roberto Navigli. *Semeval-2007 task 10: English lexical substitution task*. In Proceedings of SemEval, 2007.- For **LST-14**, the citation is: > Gerhard Kremer, Katrin Erk, Sebastian Pad√≥, and Stefan Thater. *What substitutes tell us: analysis of an all-words lexical substitution corpus*. In Proceedings of EACL, 2014.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
