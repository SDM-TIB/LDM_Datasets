To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLEARumor at SemEval-2019 Task 7: ConvoLving ELMo Against Rumors" by Ipek Baris et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the **RumourEval 2019** task, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their research.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors provide a brief overview of the RumourEval 2019 dataset. They mention that it contains a dataset of labelled threads from Twitter and Reddit, which is crucial information for my extraction.In the **introduction**, the authors describe the dataset as follows:- **RumourEval 2019**: This dataset is used for determining rumor veracity and support for rumors. It includes labelled threads from Twitter and Reddit, where each source post mentions a rumor. This indicates that the dataset is structured for classification tasks related to rumor detection.Now, I will check the **evaluation section** to confirm the details of the dataset. The authors provide a summary of the dataset in Table 1, which lists the number of labelled instances for both subtasks (SDQC and Verification). This confirms the dataset's structure and usage in their experiments.Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the RumourEval 2019 dataset. The citation is as follows:- **RumourEval 2019**: > Genevieve Gorrell, Kalina Bontcheva, Leon Derczynski, Elena Kochkina, Maria Liakata, and Arkaitz Zubaga. *SemEval-2019 Task 7: RumourEval: Determining Rumour Veracity and Support for Rumours*. In SemEval@NAACL-HLT, pages 1-8, 2019.Since the paper primarily focuses on the RumourEval 2019 dataset, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
