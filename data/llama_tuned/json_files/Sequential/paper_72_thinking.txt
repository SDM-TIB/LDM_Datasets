To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A new dataset of literary events" by David Bamman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a new dataset of literary events, which suggests that a specific dataset will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **data section** where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of approximately the first 2000 words of 100 literary works published before 1923, which is a significant dataset for literary event detection.In the **data section**, the authors provide specific details about the dataset, including the number of tokens (210,532) and the source of the texts (Project Gutenberg). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the Project Gutenberg corpus as the source of the texts, which is a well-known dataset in the field of literary studies.The citation for the dataset is:> David Bamman, Sejal Popat, and Sheng Shen. *Annotated dataset of literary entities*. NAACL, 2019.Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format for further processing or review.
