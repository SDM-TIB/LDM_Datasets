To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Named Entity Recognition - Is there a glass ceiling?" by Tomasz Stanislawek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyzed errors in state-of-the-art models, which suggests that datasets related to named entity recognition (NER) are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the CoNLL 2003 dataset for their analysis. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.In the **methods section**, the authors describe their annotation process and mention the CoNLL 2003 dataset again, confirming its use in their experiments. They also refer to new diagnostic datasets created for their study, which indicates that these datasets are also relevant.I will also check the **results section** to see if they provide additional datasets or confirm the use of the CoNLL 2003 dataset for their analysis. The authors discuss the results of their experiments, which further emphasizes the importance of the CoNLL 2003 dataset.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the CoNLL 2003 dataset. The citation is as follows:> Erik F. Tjong Kim Sang and Fien De Meulder. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Natural Language Learning at HLT-NAACL 2003, pages 1-9, 2003.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the CoNLL 2003 dataset, ensuring to include the full citation. Since the authors also mention new diagnostic datasets, I will note that they are part of their research but may not have a formal citation like the CoNLL 2003 dataset.Finally, I will summarize the findings, including the CoNLL 2003 dataset and the new diagnostic datasets, ready for further processing or review.
