To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BERT for Coreference Resolution: Baselines and Analysis" by Mandar Joshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved strong improvements on the **OntoNotes and GAP benchmarks**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **method section**, where the authors describe their approach and mention the datasets used for evaluation. They specifically refer to the **OntoNotes dataset** and the **GAP dataset**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are integral to their research.In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used the **OntoNotes dataset** for their coreference resolution tasks and provide details about its structure, including the types of texts it contains. They also mention the **GAP dataset** as another benchmark for their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **OntoNotes dataset**, the citation is: > Sameer Pradhan, Alessandro Moschitti, Nianwen Xue, Olga Uryupina, and Yuchen Zhang. *OntoNotes 5.0: A Shared Task for Coreference Resolution*. In Proceedings of the 2012 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-10, 2012.2. For the **GAP dataset**, the citation is: > Kellie Webster, Marta Recasens, Vera Axelrod, and Jason Baldridge. *Mind the GAP: A Balanced Corpus of Gendered Ambiguous Pronouns*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 6:605-617, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
