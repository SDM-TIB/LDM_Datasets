To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FastFusionNet: New State-of-the-Art for DAWNbench Squad Technical Report" by Felix Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on **DAWNbench** and **SQuAD**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to gather more context about the datasets. The authors mention several reading comprehension datasets, including **SQuAD**, **DAWNbench**, and others. I will note these datasets as potential candidates for extraction.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they conducted their experiments on the **SQuAD dataset**, which contains 87K, 10K, and 10K context-question pairs for training, development, and testing. This confirms the dataset's relevance and provides details about its structure.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:1. For **SQuAD**, the citation is: > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2016.2. For **DAWNbench**, the citation is: > Cody Coleman, Deepak Narayanan, Daniel Kang, Tian Zhao, Jian Zhang, Luigi Nardi, Peter Bailis, Kunle Olukotun, Chris RA, and Matei Zaharia. *DAWNbench: An end-to-end deep learning benchmark and competition*. NIPS MLSys, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
