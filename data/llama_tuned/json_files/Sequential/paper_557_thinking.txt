To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sentence-Level Propaganda Detection in News Articles with Transfer Learning and BERT-BiLSTM-Capsule Model" by George-Alexandru Vlad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the **NLP4IF-2019 Shared Task SLC**, which suggests that a dataset related to propaganda detection is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **evaluation sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the need for propaganda detection and mention the **SLC task**, which is a shared task in NLP4IF-2019. This indicates that the SLC dataset is likely used for their experiments.In the **evaluation section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments:1. **SLC Dataset**: This dataset contains 350 articles annotated for the presence of propaganda with two labels: propaganda and non-propaganda.2. **Emotion Dataset**: This dataset is a unified dataset for emotion classification, which includes three emotion classes (neutral, happiness, and sadness) and is augmented with additional datasets for a total of 16,297 sentences. The authors mention that they used the **Daily Dialogue Dataset** and the **Semeval-2019 Task 3 Dataset** to augment the emotion dataset.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **SLC Dataset**, the citation is: > Giovanni Da San Martino, Seunghak Yu, Alberto Barrón-Cedeño, Rostislav Petrov, and Preslav Nakov. *Fine-Grained Analysis of Propaganda in News Articles*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019, Hong Kong, China, November 3-7, 2019.- For the **Emotion Dataset**, the citation is: > Laura Ana Maria Bostan and Roman Klinger. *An analysis of annotated corpora for emotion classification in text*. In Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pages 2104a2119, 2018.- For the **Daily Dialogue Dataset**, the citation is: > Yanran Li, Hui Su, Xiaoyu Shen, Wenjie Li, Ziqiang Cao, and Shuzi Niu. *Daily dialog: A manually labelled multi-turn dialogue dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.03957, 2017.- For the **Semeval-2019 Task 3 Dataset**, the citation is: > Ankush Chatterjee, Kedhar Nath Narahari, Meghana Joshi, and Puneet Agrawal. *SEMEval-2019 Task 3: Emotion Contextual Emotion Detection*. In Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pages 39a48, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited as found in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
