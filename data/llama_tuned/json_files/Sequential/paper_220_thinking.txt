To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Argumentative Link Prediction using Residual Networks and Multi-Objective Learning" by Andrea Galassi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a challenging dataset consisting of user-generated comments, which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges in argumentation mining and mention the use of a dataset for evaluation. In the **benchmark section**, they explicitly state that they evaluated their model against the **Cornell eRule-making Corpus (CDCP)**, which consists of 731 user comments from a eRule-making website, totaling approximately 4,700 propositions. This is a clear indication of the dataset being used.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide additional details about the CDCP dataset, including the number of documents and the types of propositions categorized. They also mention that the dataset is annotated with various argumentative structures, which reinforces its significance.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CDCP dataset. The citation is as follows:> Vlad Niculae, Joonsuk Park, and Claire Cardie. *Argument mining with structured SVMs and RNNs*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2017, Vancouver, Canada, July 30 - August 4, Volume 1: Long Papers, pages 985a995. Association for Computational Linguistics.Since the CDCP is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details.
