To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HIT-SCIR at MRP 2019: A Unified Pipeline for Meaning Representation Parsing via Efficient Training and Effective Encoding" by Wanxiang Che et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the CoNLL 2019 shared task and mentions the use of semantic graphbanks, which suggests that datasets related to these graphbanks may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors refer to various semantic graphbanks, but they do not specify any datasets. I will need to look for more detailed information in the experiments section.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their approach and mention the use of the **MRP dataset** for training and evaluation. They also refer to the **SDP, PSD, EDS, UCCA, and AMR frameworks**, which are associated with specific datasets. However, they do not provide specific dataset names in this section.I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the following datasets:- For the **MRP dataset**, the citation is: > Stephan Oepen, Omri Abend, Jan Hajic, Daniel Hershcovich, Marco Kuhlmann, Tim OaGorman, Ni-anwen Xue, and Milan Straka. *MRP 2019: Cross-framework Meaning Representation Parsing*. In CoNLL, 2019.- For the **SDP, PSD, EDS, UCCA, and AMR frameworks**, while the authors do not provide specific dataset names, they refer to the following works that describe the datasets associated with these frameworks:1. **SDP**: > Omri Abend and Ari Rappoport. *Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA)*. In ACL, 2013.2. **PSD**: > Omri Abend and Ari Rappoport. *The state of the Diederik P. Kingma and Jimmy Ba. *A method for stochastic optimization in neural networks*. In ICLR, 2015.3. **EDS**: > Jan Buys and Phil Blunsom. *Robust incremental neural semantic graph parsing*. In ACL, 2017.4. **UCCA**: > Daniel Hershcovich, Omri Abend, and Ari Rappoport. *A transition-based directed acyclic graph parser for UCCA*. In ACL, 2017.5. **AMR**: > Laura Banarescu, Claire Bonial, Shu Cai, Madalina Georgescu, Kira Griffl, Ulf Hermjakob, Kevin Knight, Philipp Koehn, Martha Palmer, and Nathan Schneider. *Abstract Meaning Representation for Semantic Banking*. In LAWID, 2013.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
