To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection of Adverse Drug Reaction mentions in tweets using ELMo" by Sarah Sarabadani, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a specific dataset for their experiments, which suggests that I should look for detailed descriptions in the methods section.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction discusses the use of ELMo embeddings and mentions the availability of tweets related to drug-related issues, but it does not specify a dataset name.In the **methods section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors describe the preprocessing steps and the models used but do not provide a specific dataset name. However, they mention that they were provided with **25,672 tweets** for task 1 and a subset of **2,367 tweets** for task 2. This indicates that these tweets are the datasets used in their experiments.I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors reference any additional datasets or provide further details about the tweets. The results mention the performance of the models on the evaluation data, which consists of **1,000 tweets**, but again, no specific dataset name is provided.Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset of tweets. The authors reference the FDA as the source of the tweets, but they do not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself. However, I can infer that the tweets are part of a publicly available dataset or a specific challenge, which may not have a formal citation.Since the paper does not provide a formal dataset name or citation, I will summarize the datasets as follows:1. **Dataset of Tweets**: This dataset consists of 25,672 tweets, including 2,374 positive tweets and 23,298 negative tweets, along with approximately 5,000 unlabeled tweets. The authors used a subset of 2,367 tweets for task 2, which includes 1,212 positive and 1,155 negative tweets. The evaluation data consists of 1,000 tweets.Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant details and citations where applicable. However, since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the tweets, I will note that the dataset is derived from publicly available sources related to the FDA and the SMM4H challenge.
