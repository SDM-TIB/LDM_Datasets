To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Syntactic and Semantic Information in Word Embeddings using Graph Convolutional Networks" by Shikhar Vashishth et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of word embeddings and mentions the **Wikipedia2 corpus** for training models, which indicates that this is a dataset used in their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methods. They explicitly state that they used the **Wikipedia2 corpus** for training their models, which is a significant dataset for their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the dataset, including its size and the preprocessing steps taken. They mention that the corpus consists of 57 million sentences, 1.1 billion tokens, and 1 billion syntactic dependencies, which confirms the dataset's relevance.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Wikipedia2 corpus**. The citation is as follows:> Wikipedia. *Wikipedia2 corpus*. Available at: https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/20180301/After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
