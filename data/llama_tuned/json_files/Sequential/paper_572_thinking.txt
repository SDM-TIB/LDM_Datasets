To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Source-Conditional ELMo-style Model for Machine Translation Quality Estimation" by Junpei Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **WMT 2019 sentence-level QE task**, which suggests that a dataset related to machine translation quality estimation is involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. They mention using **WMT-2019 QE dataset** for their experiments. This is a clear indication of a dataset relevant to their research.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. They specify that they used the **WMT-2019 QE dataset** for their experiments, which includes various parallel corpora for English to German and English to Russian translations. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their quality estimation task.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the WMT-2019 QE dataset. The citation is as follows:> Junpei Zhou, Zhisong Zhang, Zecong Hua. *Source-Conditional ELMo-style Model for Machine Translation Quality Estimation*. In Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT), Volume 3: Shared Task Papers (Day 2) pages 106a111, Florence, Italy, August 1-2, 2019.Since the paper does not provide additional datasets beyond the WMT-2019 QE dataset, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry with the necessary details, including the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
