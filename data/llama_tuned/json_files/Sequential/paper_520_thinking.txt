To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Role of Protected Class Word Lists in Bias Identification of Contextualized Word Representations" by Jo√£o Sedoc and Lyle Ungar, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of word lists for debiasing word embeddings, which suggests that datasets related to word lists might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **target word lists section**. Here, the authors mention using various word lists for debiasing, including lists of pronouns, gender-specific words, and racial names. This indicates that specific datasets or collections of words are being utilized, but I need to find their names and citations.In the **target word lists section**, the authors specify the following word lists:1. **Pronouns**: The authors refer to a list of pronouns used for debiasing, but they do not provide a specific dataset name.2. **Gender-specific words**: They mention a more comprehensive list of gender-specific words, including terms related to occupations, relationships, and other commonly used words. However, again, no specific dataset is named.3. **Racial names**: The authors refer to a list of racial names, but like the pronouns and gender-specific words, they do not provide a specific dataset name.Now, I will check the **references section** to find any citations that might correspond to the datasets or word lists mentioned. The references include various papers that discuss word embeddings and debiasing methods, but they do not provide specific dataset names or citations for the word lists mentioned in the paper. However, I can infer that the word lists are based on existing datasets or collections of words that are commonly used in NLP research. Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, I will note that the word lists are derived from general knowledge in the field of NLP and may not have formal citations.Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format, noting that while the paper discusses the use of word lists for debiasing, it does not provide specific dataset names or citations. This approach will ensure that I accurately capture the essence of the datasets mentioned in the paper while acknowledging the lack of formal citations for the word lists used.
