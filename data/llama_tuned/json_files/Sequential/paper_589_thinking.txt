To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Concordia NLG Surface Realizer at SRa19" by Farhood Farahnak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the model's purpose and the context of the Surface Realization Shared Task (SRa19), which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **dataset section** (section 3) where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the shallow track of the SRa19 task utilized training and development sets from the **Universal Dependency (UD) datasets**. The authors specify that these datasets were taken from the UD datasets, which indicates that I need to find the original sources of these datasets.In the **dataset section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for training and development, including the number of sentences and the languages involved. They mention that the datasets consist of four training sets (en ewt-ud-train, en gum-ud-train, en lines-ud-train, and en partut-ud-train) and provide a total of 19,976 sentences for training.Now, I will look for the full citations of the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the Universal Dependency datasets, but I need to find the original papers that describe these datasets. The relevant citation for the Universal Dependency datasets is:- For the **Universal Dependency (UD) datasets**, the citation is: > Marie-Catherine de Marneffe, Timothy Dozat, Natalia Silveira, Katri Haverinen, Filip Ginter, Joakim Nivre, and Christopher D. Manning. *Universal Stanford dependencies: A cross-linguistic typology*. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-2014), pages 4585a4592, Reykjavik, Iceland, 2014. European Languages Resources Association (ELRA).After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
