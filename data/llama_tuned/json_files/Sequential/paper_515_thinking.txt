To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fermi at SemEval-2019 Task 6: Identifying and Categorizing Offensive Language in Social Media using Sentence Embeddings" by Vijayasaradhi Indurthi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the OffensEval task, which suggests that datasets related to this task may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention that the dataset used for their experiments is derived from the OffensEval task, specifically referencing the dataset used in the task.In the **dataset section**, the authors explicitly state that the dataset consists of **14,100 posts** for the three sub-tasks: Offensive Language Detection, Categorization of Offensive Language, and Offensive Language Target Identification. They provide a breakdown of the dataset size and the types of labels associated with each sub-task, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OffensEval dataset. The relevant citation is:- For the OffensEval dataset, the citation is: > Marcos Zampieri, Shervin Malmasi, Preslav Nakov, Sara Rosenthal, Noura Farra, and Ritesh Kumar. *Predicting the Type and Target of Offensive Posts in Social Media*. In Proceedings of NAACL, 2019.Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset name but mentions the OffensEval task, I will use the citation above as the reference for the dataset used in the research.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the details extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citation for the OffensEval dataset.
