To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning for Hindi Text Classification: A Comparison" by Ramchandra Joshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of translated versions of English datasets for evaluating models on Hindi text classification tasks, indicating that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **datasets section** (section 3) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:1. **TREC question dataset**: This dataset is used for classifying question sentences into six types, with a total of 5,452 training samples and 500 testing samples.2. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank datasets (SST-1 and SST-2)**: SST-1 contains 8,544 training samples, 2,210 testing samples, and 1,101 validation samples. SST-2 has 6,920 training samples, 1,821 testing samples, and 872 validation samples. The authors note that the original English versions of these datasets were translated into Hindi using Google Translate.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **TREC question dataset**, the citation is: > TREC (TREC) datasets. Available at: https://trec.nist.gov/datasets.html- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank datasets (SST-1 and SST-2)**, the citation is: > Stanford Natural Language Processing Group. *The Stanford Sentiment Treebank*. 2013. Available at: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/sentiment/After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
