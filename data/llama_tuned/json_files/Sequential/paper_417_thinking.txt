To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Attentive Sentence-Pair Modeling via Distilled Sentence Embedding" by Oren Barkan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on five GLUE sentence-pair tasks, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks will be discussed.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 4.1), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention the following datasets:1. **MRPC (Dolan and Brockett, 2005)**: This dataset is used for semantic similarity tasks.2. **MNLI (Williams et al., 2018)**: This dataset is a natural language inference benchmark.3. **QQP**: This dataset is used for question answering tasks.4. **QNLI (Wang et al., 2018)**: This dataset is also used for question answering tasks.5. **STS-B (Cer et al., 2017)**: This dataset focuses on semantic textual similarity.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For **MRPC**, the citation is: > Dolan, W. B., & Brockett, C. (2005). Automatically constructing a corpus of sentential paraphrases. In IWP@IJCNLP.- For **MNLI**, the citation is: > Williams, A., Nangia, N., & Bowman, S. R. (2017). A broad coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.05426.- For **QQP**, the citation is: > Wang, A., Singh, A., Michael, J., Hill, F., Levy, O., & Bowman, S. R. (2018). GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.07461.- For **QNLI**, the citation is: > Wang, A., Singh, A., Michael, J., Hill, F., Levy, O., & Bowman, S. R. (2018). GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.07461.- For **STS-B**, the citation is: > Cer, D., Diab, M., Agirre, E., Lopez-Gazpio, I., & Lucia, S. (2017). SemEval-2017 task 1: Semantic textual similarity multilingual and crosslingual focused evaluation. In Proceedings of SemEval-2017, pages 1a14, Vancouver, Canada.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
