To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Labeled Parsing with Deep Inside-Outside Recursive Autoencoders" by Andrew Drozdov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of the **Wall Street Journal (WSJ) dataset** for evaluating the proposed method, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **WSJ-10 dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is specifically referenced in the context of unsupervised labeled constituency parsing.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the WSJ-10 dataset. The citation is as follows:> Andrew Drozdov, Pat Verga, Mohit Yadav, Mohit Iyyer, and Andrew McCallum. *Unsupervised latent tree induction with deep inside-outside recursive autoencoders*. In North American Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL), 2019.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
