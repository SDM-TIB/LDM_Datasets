To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Embedding from Subword-aware Language Models" by Jiangtong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method on various NLP tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **One Billion Word dataset** for training their models. This is a significant dataset for language modeling tasks, and I need to gather more details about it.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they trained their models on the **One Billion Word dataset**. They also mention using the **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus** for the textual entailment task. This is another important dataset for their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **One Billion Word dataset**, the citation is: > Ciprian Chelba, Tomas Mikolov, Mike Schuster, Qi Ge, Thorsten Brants, Philipp Koehn, and Tony Robinson. *One Billion Word Benchmark for Measuring Progress in Statistical Language Modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.3005, 2013.2. For the **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus**, the citation is: > Samuel R Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D Manning. *A Large Annotated Corpus for Learning Natural Language Inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2015).After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
