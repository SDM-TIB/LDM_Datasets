To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLP at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Multi-Encoder in Hierarchical Attention Networks for Contextual Emotion Detection" by Changjie Li and Yun Xing, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the task of contextual emotion detection in text, which suggests that datasets related to emotion detection may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments and evaluation section**. Here, the authors mention the datasets used for training and testing their model. They specify that they used 30160 conversations for training, 2755 for development, and 5509 for testing. This indicates that there is a dataset related to conversations, but I need to find the exact name and citation.In the **data preparation section**, the authors describe the preprocessing steps and mention that they created additional datasets through data augmentation. However, they do not provide a specific name for these datasets. Instead, they refer to the original training, cleaned training, and augmented training datasets, which are derived from the conversations. I will need to look for the original source of these datasets.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the SemEval-2019 Task 3, which is a competition focused on contextual emotion detection. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name in the references. Instead, they refer to the task itself, which may not have a dedicated dataset citation.Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will summarize the datasets as follows:1. **Original Training Dataset**: This dataset consists of 30160 conversations for training the model.2. **Cleaned Training Dataset**: A subset of the original training dataset, cleaned for use in the model.3. **Augmented Training Dataset**: An expanded version of the cleaned training dataset, created through data augmentation.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, noting that while the paper does not provide specific dataset names, it describes the datasets in detail. I will ensure to include the context of the task and the preprocessing steps taken, as these are crucial for understanding the datasets' purpose and relevance in the research.
