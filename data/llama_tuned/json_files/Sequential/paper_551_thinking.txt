To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STUFIIT at SemEval-2019 Task 5: Multilingual Hate Speech Detection on Twitter with MUSE and ELMo Embeddings" by Michal BojkovskA y and MatA uEs Pikuliak, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate multilingual learning for hate speech detection on Twitter, which suggests that datasets related to hate speech are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of hate speech detection and mention the dataset used for their experiments. They state that the provided dataset consists of collected messages from Twitter in English and Spanish, which is a clear indication of the datasets they are working with.In the **methodology section**, the authors provide more details about the dataset, including the number of messages and the proportion labeled as hate speech. They specify that the English dataset contains 10,000 messages with 42.1% labeled as hate speech, while the Spanish dataset contains 4969 messages with 41.5% labeled as hate speech. This information is crucial for describing the datasets.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the Task definition from Basile et al. (2019) for the dataset, which is a key source of information for the dataset's origin and details.The citation for the dataset is:> Valerio Basile, Cristina Bosco, Elisabetta Fersini, Deborah Nozza, Viviana Patti, Francisco Rangel, Paolo Rosso, and Manuela Sanguinetti. *Semeval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech in Twitter*. In Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), pages 1-10, 2019.Since the paper does not provide a specific name for the dataset, I will refer to it as the "Twitter Hate Speech Dataset" based on the context provided in the paper.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the details extracted, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
