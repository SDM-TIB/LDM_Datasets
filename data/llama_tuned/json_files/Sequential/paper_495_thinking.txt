To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining Contextualized Embeddings with Natural Language Definitions" by Ting-Yun Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the analysis of contextualized word embeddings and mentions the use of the **Oxford dictionary dataset**, which indicates that this is a key dataset for their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide additional context or mention any other datasets. The introduction does not provide specific names, but it reinforces the use of the Oxford dictionary dataset for their analysis.In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their approach and mention that they train and evaluate their model on the **Oxford dictionary dataset**. This confirms that this dataset is central to their research.I will also check the **experiments section** to see if they reference any other datasets. The authors describe their experiments and the performance metrics but do not introduce any additional datasets beyond the Oxford dictionary.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the Oxford dictionary dataset. The citation is as follows:> Ting-Yun Chang, Ta-Chung Chi, Shang-Chi Tsai, and Yun-Nung Chen. *xSense: Learning sense-separated sparse representations and textual definitions for explainable word sense networks*. arXiv preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03348, 2018.Since the paper primarily focuses on the Oxford dictionary dataset, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Oxford dictionary dataset, ensuring that I include all relevant details and the correct citation.
