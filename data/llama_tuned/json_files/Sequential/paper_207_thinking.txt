To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probing the phonetic and phonological knowledge of lexical tones in TTS models" by Jian Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of controlled stimuli for testing tonal coarticulation and tone sandhi in Mandarin, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention the **Chinese Standard Mandarin Speech Corpus (CSMSC)**, which is used for training and evaluating the TTS models. This is a significant dataset for the experiments conducted.In the **methods section**, the authors provide details about the CSMSC, stating that it contains 10,000 recorded sentences read by a female speaker, totaling 12 hours of natural speech with phoneme-level Textgrid annotations and text transcriptions. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CSMSC. The citation is as follows:> J. Shen, R. Pang, R. J. Weiss, M. Schuster, N. Jaitly, Z. Yang, Z. Chen, Y. Zhang, Y. Wang, R. Skerrv-Ryan, et al. *Natural TTS synthesis by conditioning WaveNet on mel spectrogram predictions*. In 2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 4779a4783, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8486418Since the paper primarily focuses on the CSMSC for its experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
