To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLaC Lab at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Contextual Emotion Detection Using a Combination of Neural Networks and SVM" by Elham Mohammadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper focuses on a dataset for contextual emotion detection, which suggests that a specific dataset is used.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors discuss the context of emotion detection and mention a dataset of 3-round dialogues, which is a strong indication that a dataset is involved.In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors describe their system's architecture and mention that they used a dataset consisting of 3-round dialogues. This indicates that the dataset is crucial for their experiments.I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional details about the dataset, such as its size or characteristics. However, the focus is primarily on the performance of their system rather than the dataset itself.In the **references section**, I will look for the full citation of the dataset. The authors reference the EmoContext task, which is associated with the dataset they used. The citation for this task is:- For the EmoContext task, the citation is: > Ankush Chatterjee, Umang Gupta, Manoj Kumar Chinnakotla, Radhakrishnan Srikanth, Michel Galley, and Puneet Agrawal. *Understanding Emotions in Text Using Deep Learning and Big Data*. Computers in Human Behavior, 93:309a317, 2019.Now, I will compile the dataset entry based on the information gathered. The dataset is described as consisting of 3-round dialogues, and the citation for the EmoContext task provides the necessary details for the dataset.The dataset entry will include the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured the information from the paper.
