To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural language understanding for task-oriented dialogue in the biomedical domain in a low resources context" by Antoine Neuraz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, data generation and augmentation, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a large EHR corpus for training a NLU model, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **data generation and augmentation section**. Here, the authors describe the creation of a training dataset using templates and terminologies. They mention that they collected a set of 178 questions annotated manually as a gold standard, which indicates a dataset used for training their model.In the **experiments section**, the authors refer to the use of a large EHR corpus for training and evaluation. They also mention that the test set consists of real-world data, which is crucial for understanding the context of the dataset used for evaluation.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the EHR corpus. The authors do not provide a specific dataset name in the references, but they mention a large EHR corpus used for training. However, they refer to a local hospital's clinical data warehouse, which is a significant dataset for the biomedical domain.The citation for the clinical data warehouse is:> Wang, Y., Liu, S., Afzal, N., Rastegar-Mojarad, M., Wang, L., Shen, F., Kingsbury, P., & Liu, H. (2018). A comparison of word embeddings for the biomedical natural language processing. *Journal of Biomedical Informatics*, 87, 12-20. doi: 10.1016/j.jbi.2018.09.008. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046418301825Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset name but refers to a large EHR corpus, I will summarize the findings as follows:1. **EHR Corpus**: A large dataset used for training the NLU model, consisting of clinical notes from a local hospital in France. The authors generated a training dataset using this corpus, along with a set of 178 questions annotated as a gold standard.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the relevant details and citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured the information from the paper.
