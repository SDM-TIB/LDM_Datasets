To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EXPLOITING UNSUPERVISED PRE-TRAINING AND AUTOMATED FEATURE ENGINEERING FOR LOW-RESOURCE HATE SPEECH DETECTION IN POLISH" by Renard Korzeniowski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the authors' contributions to the PolEval 2019 Task 6, which suggests that datasets related to hate speech detection may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods** sections, particularly looking for any specific datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors mention using a "huge unlabelled corpus" for training a Polish language model and a "smaller dataset" provided by the competition organizers for classification. This indicates that there are at least two datasets relevant to their work.In the **methods section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used:1. **PolEval 2018 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as the source of the smaller dataset for classification. The citation for this dataset is: > Ogrodniczuk, M., & Aukasz Kobyliński, A. (2018). Proceedings of the PolEval 2018 Workshop, Warsaw, Poland. Institute of Computer Science, Polish Academy of Sciences.2. **PolEval Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as the source of the huge unlabelled corpus for training the Polish language model. The citation for this dataset is: > Ogrodniczuk, M., & Aukasz Kobyliński, A. (2018). Proceedings of the PolEval 2018 Workshop, Warsaw, Poland. Institute of Computer Science, Polish Academy of Sciences.Now, I will check the **references section** to ensure I have the correct citations for both datasets. The citations are as follows:- For the **PolEval 2018 Dataset**, the citation is the same as mentioned above.- For the **PolEval Dataset**, the citation is also the same as mentioned above.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
