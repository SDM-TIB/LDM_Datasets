To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distilling Knowledge Learned in BERT for Text Generation" by Yen-Chun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of BERT for text generation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets for their experiments:1. **IWSLT14 German-English (De-En)**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks, containing 160k training samples. The authors specify that they follow the pre-processing steps outlined in Wu et al. (2019) for this dataset.2. **IWSLT15 English-Vietnamese (En-Vi)**: This dataset is also used for machine translation, with 113k training samples. The authors mention using the pre-processed dataset provided by Luong and Manning (2015).3. **WMT14 English-German (En-De)**: This dataset is utilized for machine translation, consisting of 4.5M training samples. The authors describe their pre-processing steps based on Vaswani et al. (2017) for this dataset.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For **IWSLT14 German-English**, the citation is: > Wu, F., Fan, A., Baevski, A., Dauphin, Y., & Auli, M. (2019). Pay less attention with lightweight and dynamic convolutions. In ICLR.- For **IWSLT15 English-Vietnamese**, the citation is: > Luong, M. T., & Manning, C. D. (2015). Stanford neural machine translation systems for spoken language domain. In IWSLT.- For **WMT14 English-German**, the citation is: > Vaswani, A., Shazeer, N., Parmar, N., Uszkoreit, J., Jones, L., Gomez, A. N., Kaiser, A., & Polosukhin, I. (2017). Attention is all you need. In NIPS.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
