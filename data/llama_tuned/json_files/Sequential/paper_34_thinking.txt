To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Distance Relationships without Time Travel: Boosting the Performance of a Sparse Predictive Autoencoder in Sequence Modeling" by Jeremy Gordon, David Rawlinson, and Subutai Ahmad, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of a predictive autoencoder for sequence modeling, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of language modeling.Next, I will focus on the **method section**, where the authors describe their model and the tasks they applied it to. They mention two specific datasets used for evaluation:1. **Stochastic Sequential MNIST (ssMNIST)**: This dataset is derived from the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits. The authors describe how they modified the MNIST dataset to create a partially observable sequence learning task.2. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: This dataset is a well-known resource for language modeling tasks. The authors state that they used the PTB dataset for their language modeling experiments.Now, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm the details of how these datasets were utilized. The authors provide specific configurations and results for both datasets, which reinforces their relevance in the study.In the **references section**, I will look for the full citations for these datasets:- For **MNIST**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/- For **Penn Treebank (PTB)**, the citation is: > Marcus, M., Kim, G., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., MacIntyre, R., Bies, A., Ferguson, M., Katz, K., and Schasberger, B. *The Penn Treebank: Annotating Predicate Argument Structure*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Human Language Technology, pages 114a119, 1994.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
