To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language Modeling Teaches You More Syntax than Translation Does: Lessons Learned Through Auxiliary Task Analysis" by Kelly W. Zhang and Samuel R. Bowman, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of deep LSTMs for language understanding and mentions training on datasets from WMT 2016, which indicates that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors explicitly state that they control for data domain by training on datasets from WMT 2016. This suggests that there is a specific dataset used for their experiments.In the **methodology**, the authors mention using the parallel En-De corpus, which is a well-known dataset in machine translation tasks. They also refer to augmenting this dataset with a large monolingual corpus from WMT, which adds another dataset to their analysis.I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide further details about the datasets used. However, the primary datasets identified are the parallel En-De corpus and the monolingual corpus from WMT.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **parallel En-De corpus**, the citation is: > Ondrej Bojar, Rajen Chatterjee, Christian Federmann, Yvette Graham, Barry Haddow, Matthias Huck, Antonio Jimeno Yepes, Philipp Koehn, Varvara Logacheva, Christof Monz, Matteo Negri, Aurelie Neveol, Mariana Neves, Martin Popel, Matt Post, Raphael Rubino, Carolina Scarton, Lucia Speccia, Marco Turchi, Karin Verspoor, and Marcos Zampieri. *Findings of the 2016 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT16)*. In Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 1-10, 2016.2. For the **monolingual corpus from WMT**, the citation is: > Ondrej Bojar, Rajen Chatterjee, Christian Federmann, Yvette Graham, Barry Haddow, Matthias Huck, Antonio Jimeno Yepes, Philipp Koehn, Varvara Logacheva, Christof Monz, Matteo Negri, Aurelie Neveol, Mariana Neves, Martin Popel, Matt Post, Raphael Rubino, Carolina Scarton, Lucia Speccia, Marco Turchi, Karin Verspoor, and Marcos Zampieri. *Findings of the 2016 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT16)*. In Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 1-10, 2016.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
