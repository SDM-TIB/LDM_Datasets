To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NL-FIIT at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Emotion Detection From Conversational Triplets Using Hierarchical Encoders" by Michal Farkas and Peter Lacko, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the EmoContext task, which suggests that a dataset is involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the EmoContext task. They describe it as consisting of conversational triplets, which indicates that the dataset is related to this task. However, they do not provide a specific name for the dataset in the introduction.In the **approach section**, the authors mention using the **Ekphrasis tool** for preprocessing the input data. This tool is likely used with a specific dataset, but again, they do not provide a dataset name. I will need to look further.In the **evaluation section**, the authors refer to the EmoContext task again, but they do not specify the dataset used for training or evaluation. They mention achieving a microF1 score, which indicates that the dataset is part of the EmoContext task, but again, no specific name is provided.I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited. The references include various papers related to sentiment analysis and emotion detection, but they do not specify a dataset used in this paper. The authors cite the EmoContext task, but it is not a dataset itself, rather a task.In conclusion, it appears that the paper does not explicitly mention a dataset by name. The EmoContext task is a task rather than a dataset, and the Ekphrasis tool is a tool for preprocessing data, not a dataset. Therefore, I will note that the paper does not provide specific datasets for extraction.
