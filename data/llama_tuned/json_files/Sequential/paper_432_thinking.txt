To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VATEX Video Captioning Task" by Ozan Caglayan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors are participating in a video captioning challenge, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **dataset section** (section 2) where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:1. **VATEX Dataset**: This dataset is described as providing 25,991 training, 3,000 validation, and 6,000 test videos, along with 10 English and 10 Chinese captions for each video. The authors also mention that the dataset includes spatio-temporal action features extracted from a pre-trained I3DConvNet.2. **I3D Dataset**: Although not explicitly named as a separate dataset in the paper, the authors reference the I3D action features used for video representation. This indicates that the I3D dataset is a foundational component of their work, even if it is not a standalone dataset.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **VATEX Dataset**, the citation is: > Xin Wang, Jiawei Wu, Junkun Chen, Lei Li, Yuan-Fang Wang, and William Yang Wang. *VATEX: A large-scale, high-quality multilingual dataset for video-and-language research*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.03493, 2019.- For the **I3D Dataset**, the citation is: > Jo√£o Carreira and Andrew Zisserman. *Quo vadis, action recognition? a new model and the kinetics dataset*. Proceedings of the 30th IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4724a4733, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
