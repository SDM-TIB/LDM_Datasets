To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-shot Intent Classification and Slot Filling" by Jason Krone et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors established a few-shot benchmark using three public IC/SF datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the datasets used for benchmarking, specifically naming them as **ATIS, SNIPS, and TOP**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are central to their research.In the **methods section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used. They describe **ATIS** as a well-known dataset for dialog systems, **SNIPS** as a benchmark for intent classification and slot filling, and **TOP** as a unique dataset for task-oriented dialog systems. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:1. For **ATIS**, the citation is: > Charles T. Hemphill, John J. Godfrey, and George R. Doddington. *The ATIS Spoken Language Systems Pilot Corpus*. In Speech and Natural Language: Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Hidden Valley, Pennsylvania, June 24-27, 1990.2. For **SNIPS**, the citation is: > Alice Coucke, Alaa Saade, Adrien Ball, Théodore Bluche, Alexandre Caulier, David Leroy, Clément Doumouro, Thibault Gisselbrecht, Francesco Caltagirone, Thibaut Lavril, Maël Primet, and Joseph Dureau. *Snips Voice Platform: An Embedded Spoken Language Understanding System for Private-by-Design Voice Interfaces*. CoRR, abs/1805.10190, 2018.3. For **TOP**, the citation is: > Anuj Goyal, Angeliki Metallinou, and Spyros Matsoukas. *Fast and Scalable Expansion of Natural Language Understanding Functionality for Intelligent Agents*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.01542, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
