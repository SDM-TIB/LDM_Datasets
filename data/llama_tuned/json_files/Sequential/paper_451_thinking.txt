To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NL-FIIT at IEST-2018: Emotion Recognition utilizing Neural Networks and Multi-level Preprocessing" by Samuel Pecar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the Shared Task on Implicit Emotion Recognition, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **evaluation sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the Shared Task on Implicit Emotion Recognition, which is a strong indication that a dataset is used for their experiments. I will look for specific details about the dataset in these sections.In the **evaluation section**, the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments: "The dataset for emotion recognition shared task consists of tweets where emotion word was removed. The dataset contains six different categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise. The train dataset contains approximately 150,000 tweets, and the test dataset contains more than 30,000 tweets." This provides a clear description of the dataset, including its purpose and the number of samples.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the Shared Task on Implicit Emotion Recognition, which is crucial for providing a complete citation for the dataset. The citation for the dataset is:> Roman Klinger, Orphée de Clercq, Saif M. Mohammad, and Alexandra Balahur. *IEST: WASSA-2018 Implicit Emotions Shared Task*. In Proceedings of the 9th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis, Brussels, Belgium, October 31, 2018. Association for Computational Linguistics.With this information, I can now summarize the dataset details:1. **Dataset Name**: Implicit Emotion Recognition Dataset - **Description**: A dataset consisting of tweets where emotion words have been removed, categorized into six emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise). - **Citation**: Roman Klinger, Orphée de Clercq, Saif M. Mohammad, and Alexandra Balahur. *IEST: WASSA-2018 Implicit Emotion Recognition*. In Proceedings of the 9th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis, Brussels, Belgium, October 31, 2018. Association for Computational Linguistics.Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the dataset name, description, and citation are clearly presented.
