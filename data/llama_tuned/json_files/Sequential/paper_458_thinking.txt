To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep contextualized word representations for detecting sarcasm and irony" by Suzana Ilić et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their model on **7 different datasets derived from 3 different data sources**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the following datasets:1. **Twitter Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the SemEval 2018 Task 3, Irony Detection in English Tweets. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of training, validation, and test samples.2. **Reddit Dataset**: The authors reference a dataset collected by Khodak et al. (2017) titled "SARC," which contains 600,000 sarcastic comments on Reddit. They specify the main subset used, which is SARC 2.0.3. **Sarcasm Corpus V1 (SC-V1)**: This dataset is a subset of the Internet Argument Corpus (IAC) and is used for sarcasm detection.4. **Sarcasm Corpus V2 (SC-V2)**: Another subset of the IAC, this dataset is also used for sarcasm detection.5. **SARC 2.0**: This dataset is a subset of the SARC dataset, specifically designed for sarcasm detection, and is referenced as part of the Reddit dataset.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:- For the **Twitter Dataset**, the citation is: > Cynthia Van Hee, Els Lefever, and Veronique Hoste. *SemEval-2018 Task 3: Irony Detection in English Tweets*. Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2018), pages 39a50, 2018.- For the **Reddit Dataset**, the citation is: > Mikhail Khodak, Nikunj Saunshi, and Kiran Vodrahalli. *A Large Self-Annotated Corpus for Sarcasm*. 2017.- For the **Sarcasm Corpus V1 (SC-V1)** and **Sarcasm Corpus V2 (SC-V2)**, the citation is: > Sheeren Oraby, Vrindavan Harrison, Lena Reed, Ernesto Hernandez, Ellen Riloff, and Marilyn Walker. *Creating and Characterizing a Diverse Corpus of Sarcasm in Dialogue*. Proceedings of the 17th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue, (September):31a41, 2016.- For the **SARC 2.0**, the citation is: > Ptáček aEcek, Ivan Habernal, and Jun Hong. *Sarcasm Detection on Czech and English Twitter*. Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers (COLING 2014), Citeseer, pages 213a223, 2014.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
