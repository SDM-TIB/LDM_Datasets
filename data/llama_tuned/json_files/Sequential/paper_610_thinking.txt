To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NSIT@NLP4IF-2019: Propaganda Detection from News Articles using Transfer Learning" by Kartik Aggarwal and Anubhav Sadana, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a dataset for propaganda detection, which indicates that a specific dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (specifically section 2.1, **Dataset**), where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of news articles in TXT format, with labels indicating whether the articles are propaganda or not. The dataset is divided into training and development sets, containing 16,965 examples, with 4,720 labeled as propaganda and 12,245 as non-propaganda.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is provided by the organizers of the NLP4IF workshop, it may not have a formal citation like a traditional dataset. Instead, I will note that the dataset is referenced as being provided by the organizers of the workshop.Now, I will compile the dataset information, including its name, description, and the citation for the workshop, into a structured format for clarity.In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:1. **Propaganda Detection Dataset**: This dataset consists of news articles labeled as either propaganda or non-propaganda, with a total of 16,965 examples in the training set and 4,720 labeled as propaganda and 12,245 as non-propaganda. The dataset is provided by the organizers of the NLP4IF workshop, and while it lacks a formal citation, it is referenced as part of the workshop's contribution.Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and its context within the paper before preparing the final output.
