To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SWAP at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Emotion detection in conversation through Tweets, CNN and LSTM deep neural networks" by Marco Polignano et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **EmoContext task at SemEval-2019**, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide a specific dataset name or mention any datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction discusses the EmoContext task but does not provide a dataset name.In the **methods section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors mention that the training set consists of **30k records annotated with three main emotions: Happy, Sad, Angry, and the other class that includes all other unannotated emotions**. This indicates that the dataset is structured around emotion classification, but I need to find the full citation.The authors also refer to the **Sentiment140 dataset** for creating word embeddings, which is crucial for their experiments. I will need to find the citation for this dataset.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:1. For the **EmoContext task**, the citation is: > Ankush Chatterjee, Kedhar Nath Narahari, Meghana Joshi, and Puneet Agrawal. *Semeval-2019 task 3: Emocontext: Contextual emotion detection*. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), pages 324a329, 2019.2. For the **Sentiment140 dataset**, the citation is: > Saif M Mohammad, Svetlana Kiritchenko, and Xiao-dan Zhu. *NRC-Canada: Building the state-of-the-art in sentiment analysis of tweets*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1308.6242, 2013.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
