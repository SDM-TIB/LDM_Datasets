To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Figure Eight at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Ensemble of Transfer Learning Methods for Contextual Emotion Detection" by Joan Xiao, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and task overview sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the task of contextual emotion detection, which suggests that datasets related to emotion detection may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **task overview section** where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the task is based on a dataset containing 3-turn conversations between two people, which is classified into four emotion categories (Happy, Sad, Angry, and Others). This indicates that the dataset is specific to their task and is likely to be the primary dataset used in their experiments.In the **task overview section**, the authors provide a table summarizing the distribution of the dataset across the four emotion classes, which includes the number of training, development, and test samples for each class. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and its relevance to the task.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the following datasets in their work:1. **SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets**: This dataset is used for inferring emotions from tweets. The citation is: > Saif M Mohammad, Felipe Bravo-Marquez, Mohammad Salameh, and Svetlana Kiritchenko. *SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets*. Technical report, 2018.2. **SemEval-2019 Task 3: Emocontext: Contextual emotion detection**: This dataset is specifically designed for contextual emotion detection in conversational text. The citation is: > Ankush Chatterjee, Kedhar Nath Narahari, Meghana Joshi, and Puneet Agrawal. *SemEval-2019 Task 3: Emocontext: Contextual emotion detection*. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), pages 220a224, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
