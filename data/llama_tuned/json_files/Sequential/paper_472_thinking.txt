To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer and seq2seq model for Paraphrase Generation" by Elozino Egonmwan and Yllias Chali, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets, which suggests that specific names will be provided later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **method section**, where the authors describe their framework and mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly state that they evaluated their model on two datasets: **QUORA** and **MSCOCO**. This is a clear indication of the datasets used in their research.In the **datasets section**, the authors provide more details about each dataset:1. **QUORA Dataset**: This dataset contains over 120k examples, with a split of 80k for training and 40k for testing. It consists of question pairs, which is relevant for paraphrase generation.2. **MSCOCO Dataset**: This dataset contains free-form texts that are human annotations of images. It is noted that the paraphrase pairs in MSCOCO contain more novel words and syntactic manipulations compared to the QUORA dataset, making it a more suitable dataset for paraphrase generation.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **QUORA Dataset**, the citation is: > Elozino Egonmwan and Yllias Chali. *Transformer and seq2seq model for Paraphrase Generation*. In Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Neural Generation and Translation (WNGT 2019), pages 249a255, 2019.- For the **MSCOCO Dataset**, the citation is: > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollAr, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740a755, 2014.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
