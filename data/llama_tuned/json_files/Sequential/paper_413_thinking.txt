To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Opinion Mining with Deep Contextualized Embeddings" by Wen-Bin Han and Noriko Kando, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses opinion mining and mentions the use of datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **datasets section**. In the introduction, the authors mention the importance of opinion mining and hint at the datasets used for their experiments. In the **datasets section**, they explicitly list the datasets used:1. **MPQA 1.2**: This dataset is used for opinion expression detection and includes two types of opinion expressions: direct subjective expressions (DSEs) and expressive subjective expressions (ESEs).2. **MOAT**: This dataset is also related to opinion expression and is organized by NTCIR. The authors mention that they used one tenth of this dataset for development and the rest for testing.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For **MPQA 1.2**, the citation is: > Ozan EIrsoy and Claire Cardie. *Opinion mining with deep recurrent neural networks*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 720a728, 2014.- For **MOAT**, the citation is: > Yohei Seki, David Kirk Evans, Lun-Wei Ku, Le Sun, Hsin-Hsi Chen, and Noriko Kando. *Overview of multilingual opinion analysis task at NTCIR-7*. Proceedings of The IEEE - PIEEE, 2008.Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
