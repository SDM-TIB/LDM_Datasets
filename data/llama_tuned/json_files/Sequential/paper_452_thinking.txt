To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CRNN: A Joint Neural Network for Redundancy Detection" by Xinyu Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors compare their framework against state-of-the-art text classification algorithms on four popular benchmarking corpora, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** (section 4.2) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:1. **Google-news**: A small portion of excerpts from the online platform giant Google, specifically the Google news channel.2. **Twenty-news-groups**: Originated from the publishers' newspaper twenty-news-groups, which is a collection of news articles.3. **Brown Corpus of Standard American English**: A standard corpus created by Francis and Kucera at Brown University, containing one million tokens of American English texts sampled from 15 different textual categories.4. **Question Classification**: A dataset created by Li and Roth, containing 50 classes of texts for question classification.I will also check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For **Google-news**, the citation is: > M. Karkali, F. Rousseau, A. Ntoulas, and M. Vazirgiannis. *Using temporal IDF for efficient novelty detection in text streams*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1401.1456, 2014.- For **Twenty-news-groups**, the citation is: > K. Lang. *Newsweeder: Learning to filter news*. In Proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference on Machine Learning, 1995, pp. 331a339.- For **Brown Corpus**, the citation is: > W. N. Francis and H. Kucera. *The Brown Corpus: A standard corpus of present-day edited American English*. Providence, RI: Department of Linguistics, Brown University [producer and distributor], 1979.- For **Question Classification**, the citation is: > X. Li and D. Roth. *Learning question classifiers*. In Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Computational Linguistics-Volume 1. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2002, pp. 1a7.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, into a structured format for further processing or review. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
