To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semeval-2018 Task 11: Deep Neural Network with Attention Method for Machine Comprehension Task" by Jiangnan Xia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a deep neural network model for machine comprehension and mentions the evaluation of the system on a shared task, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide specific names of datasets. The introduction references several datasets used in machine reading comprehension, including the **Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)** and the **Microsoft Machine Reading Comprehension Dataset (MS-MARCO)**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.I will then examine the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention that their system achieves 80.91% accuracy on the test data, which is based on the **test data from the shared task**. This implies that the datasets used for evaluation are part of the shared task, specifically the **Machine Comprehension using Commonsense Knowledge task**.Now, I will look at the **references section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:1. **Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)**: The citation is: > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.05250, 2016.2. **Microsoft Machine Reading Comprehension Dataset (MS-MARCO)**: The citation is: > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.09268, 2016.After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
