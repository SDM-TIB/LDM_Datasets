To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relating Simple Sentence Representations in Deep Neural Networks and the Brain" by Sharmistha Jat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used MEG brain recording data and a simple sentence corpus, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two primary datasets:1. **MEG Dataset**: This dataset is described as a non-Magnetoencephalography (MEG) invasive functional brain imaging technique that records magnetic fields produced by electrical currents in the brain. The authors specify that they used three different MEG datasets collected when subjects were shown simple sentences as stimuli. They provide a table summarizing the datasets, including the number of sentences and voice repetitions.2. **Simple Sentence Corpus (SSC)**: This dataset is a newly created corpus consisting of 256,145 sentences constructed from Wikipedia and NELL triples. The authors describe how they extracted sentences from Wikipedia and NELL triples to ensure a diverse set of sentences for their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **MEG Dataset**, the citation is: > Leila Wehbe, Ashish Vaswani, Kevin Knight, and Tom M. Mitchell. *Aligning context-based statistical models of language with brain activity during reading*. In EMNLP, pages 233a243, 2014.- For the **Simple Sentence Corpus (SSC)**, the citation is: > Partha Pratim Talukdar, Derry Wijaya, and Tom Mitchell. *Acquiring temporal constraints between relations*. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM), pages 992a1001, 2012.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
