To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Word-level Textual Adversarial Attacking as Combinatorial Optimization" by Yuan Zang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they list the datasets as follows:1. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis, specifically for binary sentiment classification. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the average sentence length and the number of classes, which is crucial for understanding its application.2. **SST-2 Dataset**: Another binary sentiment classification dataset, SST-2 is noted for its shorter average sentence length compared to IMDB, making it a challenging dataset for adversarial attacks.3. **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Dataset**: This dataset is used for natural language inference tasks, where each instance consists of a premise-hypothesis pair labeled with one of three relations: entailment, contradiction, or neutral.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide performance metrics and results for each dataset, confirming their relevance in the study.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is: > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of ACL-HLT, pages 1-9, 2011.- For the **SST-2 Dataset**, the citation is: > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of EMNLP, pages 1-10, 2013.- For the **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Dataset**, the citation is: > Samuel Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of EMNLP, pages 1-10, 2015.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
