To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training Deeper Neural Machine Translation Models with Transparent Attention" by Ankur Bapna et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the training of deep neural machine translation models, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of machine translation tasks.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and evaluation. They state that they trained their models on the **WMT14 English-German and WMT15 Czech-English datasets**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.In the **experimental setup**, the authors provide more details about the datasets:1. **WMT14 English-German Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluating the models. It is a standard benchmark for machine translation tasks.2. **WMT15 Czech-English Dataset**: Similar to the WMT14 dataset, this is another benchmark for machine translation tasks, specifically focusing on the Czech-English language pair.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **WMT14 English-German Dataset**, the citation is: > WMT 2014 English-German Translation System. *WMT 2014*.- For the **WMT15 Czech-English Dataset**, the citation is: > WMT 2015 Czech-English Translation System. *WMT 2015*After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations.
