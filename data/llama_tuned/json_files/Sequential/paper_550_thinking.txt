To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse Victory: A Large Scale Systematic Comparison of Count-Based and Prediction-Based Vectorizers for Text Classification" by Rupak Chakraborty et al., I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted a systematic comparison of various vectorization algorithms on a diverse collection of datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **datasets section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention that they collected and curated a total of **73 publicly available datasets** across various categories, including sentiment, emotion, reviews, medical, general classification, news, spam-fake-hate-ironic, and others. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the datasets, including their characteristics and the number of samples in each category.In the **datasets section**, the authors provide a table (Table 1) that summarizes the number of datasets in each category, along with the average number of tokens and sentences per dataset. This information is crucial for understanding the diversity and distribution of the datasets.I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. However, since the paper does not provide specific citations for each dataset, I will note that the datasets are publicly available and can be accessed through a provided link.Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered from the paper. The datasets include:1. **Sentiment**: Contains 16 datasets related to sentiment analysis.2. **Emotion**: Includes 7 datasets focused on emotion recognition.3. **Reviews**: Comprises 8 datasets for text classification tasks related to reviews.4. **News**: Features 8 datasets for news classification tasks.5. **General Classification**: Contains 17 datasets for general classification tasks.6. **Spam-Fake-Hate-Ironic**: Includes 10 datasets for detecting spam, fake news, and hate speech.7. **Medical**: Comprises 4 datasets related to medical text classification.8. **Other**: Includes 6 datasets for various other text classification tasks.After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details, including the number of samples and categories, as provided in the paper. Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
