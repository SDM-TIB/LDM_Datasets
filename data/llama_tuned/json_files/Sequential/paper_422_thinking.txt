To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer-based Model for Single Documents Neural Summarization" by Elozino Egonmwan and Yllias Chali, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on the **CNN/DailyMail dataset** and the **Newsroom dataset**, which suggests these are the datasets used for their experiments.Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors mention that they evaluate their models on the non-anonymized version of the **CNN/DM corpus** and the **Newsroom dataset**. This confirms the datasets used for their experiments.In the **experiments section**, I will gather more details about each dataset:1. **CNN/DM Dataset**: This dataset is used for extractive summarization tasks. It contains over 1.3 million news articles, which are summarized into 400-word summaries.2. **Newsroom Dataset**: This dataset is also used for extractive summarization and contains 1.3 million summaries with diverse extractive strategies.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **CNN/DM Dataset**, the citation is: > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend news articles*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 1693a1701, 2015.- For the **Newsroom Dataset**, the citation is: > Max Grusky, Mor Naaman, and Yoav Artzi. *Newsroom: A dataset of 1.3 million summaries with diverse extractive strategies*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 708a719, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
