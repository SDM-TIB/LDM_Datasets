To extract datasets from the research paper titled "In-domain Context-aware Token Embeddings Improve Biomedical Named Entity Recognition" by Golnar Sheikhshab et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a dataset for named entity recognition, which indicates that datasets are present.Next, I will focus on the **datasets section** (section 4) where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:1. **ELMo Training Set**: This dataset consists of a focused domain-specific subset of PubMed Central (PMC) documents, specifically focusing on biomedical papers. The authors describe how they collected 3960 full-text documents with a Medical Subject Heading (Mesh) term and ran Stanford NLP/CoreNLP tools for sentence splitting and tokenization.2. **BC2GM (BioCreative II Gene Mention Detection)**: This dataset is used for the BioCreative II Gene Mention detection shared task. It contains 15,000 training and 5,000 test sentences, all derived from PubMed abstracts, with gold annotations for gene mentions.3. **JNLPBA (Joint NLP, Bio entities, Recognition, and Annotation)**: This dataset is used for a shared task on biomedical entity detection. It includes a training set of 2,000 GENIA abstracts and a test set of 404 abstracts, annotated for various biomedical entities such as proteins, DNA, RNA, cell lines, and cell types.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For the **ELMo Training Set**, the citation is: > Matthew Peters, Mark Neumann, Mohit Iyyer, Matt Gardner, Christopher Clark, Kenton Lee, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *Deep contextualized word representations*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 2227a2237, 2018.- For the **BC2GM**, the citation is: > Larry Smith, Lorraine K Tanabe, Rie Johnson nee Ando, Cheng-Ju Kuo, I-Fang Chung, Chun-Nan Hsu, Yu-Shi Lin, Roman Klinger, Christoph M Friedrich, Kuzman Ganchev, et al. *Overview of BioCreative II Gene Mention Recognition*. Genome biology, 9(Suppl 2):1â€“19, 2008.- For the **JNLPBA**, the citation is: > Jin-Dong Kim, Tomoko Ohta, Yoshimasa Tsuruoka, Yuka Tateisi, and Nigel Collier. *Introduction to the Bio-entity Recognition Task at JNLPBA*. In Proceedings of the 2004 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), pages 70a75, 2004.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
