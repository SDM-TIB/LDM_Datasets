To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CX-ST-RNM at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Fusion of Recurrent Neural Networks Based on Contextualized and Static Word Representations for Contextual Emotion Detection" by Michal Perelkiewicz, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper focuses on the EmoContext task, which suggests that datasets related to this task will be discussed.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the EmoContext task and mentions that the datasets provided by the task organizers are unbalanced, which implies that specific datasets are involved.In the **methods section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used for preprocessing and training. The paper mentions the need to address unbalanced datasets, which suggests that the datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted. I will look for specific names of datasets in this section.In the **experiments section**, the paper describes the datasets used for validation and testing. It mentions that the training datasets are derived from the development dataset and the test dataset, indicating that these datasets are part of the EmoContext task.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the EmoContext datasets, but it does not provide specific dataset names or citations in the text. However, I can infer that the datasets are part of the SemEval 2019 competition, which is a well-known benchmark for emotion detection tasks. The citation for the EmoContext datasets is:> Ankush Chatterjee, Kedhar Nath Narahari, Meghana Joshi, and Puneet Agrawal. *Semeval-2019 task 3: Emocontext: Contextual emotion detection*. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2019.Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names, I will summarize the datasets based on the context provided:1. **EmoContext datasets**: These datasets are used for the EmoContext task, which involves classifying textual dialogues into sentiment classes. The datasets are unbalanced, with specific class distributions mentioned in the paper.Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the citation, into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
