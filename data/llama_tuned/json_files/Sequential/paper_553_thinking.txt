To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Sentiment of Polish Language Short Texts" by Aleksander Wawer and Julita Sobiczewska, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize various Polish language datasets for sentiment analysis, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data Sets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:1. **Polish Sentiment Treebank (TW)**: This dataset is described as a dependency treebank with sentiment annotations, specifically designed for studying compositional phenomena in sentiment analysis. It includes sentences from SkAadnica Treebank and product reviews.2. **Twitter Data**: This dataset consists of one thousand Polish language tweets manually labeled for sentiment analysis, covering a variety of topics and user types.3. **Movie Reviews**: This dataset contains one thousand manually collected movie reviews from a Polish website, with a focus on short texts and numeric ratings.4. **PolEval 2017**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the context of the PolEval 2017 campaign, which evaluates natural language processing tools for Polish. It is referenced in the context of the sentiment analysis tasks.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For **Polish Sentiment Treebank (TW)**, the citation is: > Radim ERehEuErek and Petr Sojka. *Software Framework for Topic Modelling with Large Corpora*. In Proceedings of the LREC 2010 Workshop on New Methods in Text Mining, pages 1-8, 2010.- For **Twitter Data**, the citation is: > Aleksander Wawer and Maciej Ogrodniczuk. *Results of the PolEval 2017 competition: Sentiment Analysis shared task*. In Proceedings of the 8th Language & Technology Conference: Human Language Technologies as a Challenge for Computer Science and Linguistics, pages 406a409, 2017.- For **Movie Reviews**, the citation is: > Bo Pang, Lillian Lee, and Shivakumar Vaithyanathan. *Thumbs up?: sentiment classification using machine learning techniques*. In Proceedings of the ACL-02 conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Volume 10, pages 79a86, 2002.- For **PolEval 2017**, the citation is: > Aleksander Wawer and Maciej Ogrodniczuk. *Results of the PolEval 2017 competition: Sentiment Analysis shared task*. In Proceedings of the 8th Language & Technology Conference: Human Language Technologies as a Challenge for Computer Science and Linguistics, pages 406a409, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
