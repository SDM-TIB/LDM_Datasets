To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Ensemble of Attention-based BiLSTM Models for Machine Comprehension" by Peng Ding and Xiaobing Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of GloVe and Word2Vec for word embeddings, which suggests that datasets related to these tools might be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the CNN/DailyMail dataset. This is a strong indication that a specific dataset is being referenced. I will look for more details about this dataset in the **experiments or results sections** to confirm its usage.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **CNN/DailyMail dataset** for their experiments. They describe the dataset as containing 9837 training questions, 1417 development questions, and 2797 test questions, which is crucial information for a dataset entry.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CNN/DailyMail dataset. The citation is as follows:> Chen, D., Bolton, J., & Manning, C. D. (2016). The CNN/DailyMail reading comprehension task. In Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), volume 1, pages 2358a2367.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and citation in a structured format for clarity and completeness. This will allow for easy reference and further analysis of the datasets used in the research.
