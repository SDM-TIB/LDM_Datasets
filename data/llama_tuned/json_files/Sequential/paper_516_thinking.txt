To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural Language Generation for Effective Knowledge Distillation" by Raphael Tang, Yao Lu, and Jimmy Lin, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the construction of an unlabeled transfer dataset for knowledge distillation, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for validation. Here, they list four datasets:1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank-2 (SST-2)**: A binary polarity dataset of single-sentence movie reviews.2. **Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA)**: A single-sentence grammaticality task with expertly annotated binary judgments.3. **Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B)**: Sentence pairs labeled with real-valued similarity between 1 and 5.4. **Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC)**: Sentence pairs with binary labels denoting semantic equivalence.I will then check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For **SST-2**, the citation is: > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A., & Potts, C. (2013). Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank. In Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 1-10).- For **CoLA**, the citation is: > Warstadt, A., Singh, A., & Bowman, S. R. (2018). Neural network acceptability judgments. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 1-10).- For **STS-B**, the citation is: > Cer, D., Diab, M., Agirre, E., Lopez-Gazpio, I., & Specia, L. (2017). SemEval-2017 task 1: Semantic textual similarity multilingual and crosslingual focused evaluation. In Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (pp. 1-10).- For **MRPC**, the citation is: > Dolan, W. B., & Brockett, C. (2005). Automatically constructing a corpus of sentential paraphrases. In Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Paraphrasing (pp. 1-10).After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
