To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BioFLAIR: Pretrained Pooled Contextualized Embeddings for Biomedical Sequence Labeling Tasks" by Shreyas Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the BioFLAIR model on various bio Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **method section**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention several benchmark corpora, including:1. **NCBI-disease**: A dataset for disease name recognition and concept normalization.2. **BC5CDR-disease**: A dataset for chemical disease relation extraction.3. **BC5DR**: A dataset for chemical drug relation extraction.4. **JNLPBA**: A dataset for bio-entity recognition.5. **Species-800**: A dataset for species identification in biomedical literature.6. **LINNAEUS**: A dataset for species name identification in biomedical literature.7. **NCBI**: A general biomedical dataset used for various NER tasks.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:- For **NCBI-disease**, the citation is: > DoAan, Rezarta Islamaj, Robert Leaman, and Zhiyong Lu. "NCBI disease corpus: a resource for disease name recognition and concept normalization." *Journal of biomedical informatics*, 47:1-10, 2014.- For **BC5CDR-disease**, the citation is: > Li, Jiao, et al. "BioCreative V CDR task corpus: a resource for chemical disease relation extraction." *Database*, 2016.- For **BC5DR**, the citation is: > Li, Jiao, et al. "BioCreative V CDR task corpus: a resource for chemical disease relation extraction." *Database*, 2016.- For **JNLPBA**, the citation is: > Kim, Jin-Dong, et al. "Introduction to the bio-entity recognition task at JNLPBA." *Proceedings of the international joint workshop on natural language processing in biomedicine and its applications*, 2004.- For **Species-800**, the citation is: > Pafilis, Evangelos, et al. "The SPECIES and ORGANISMS resources for fast and accurate identification of taxonomic names in text." *PLoS ONE*, 8(6): e65390, 2013.- For **LINNAEUS**, the citation is: > Gerner, Martin, Goran Nenadic, and Casey M. Bergman. "LINNAEUS: a species name identification system for biomedical literature." *BMC bioinformatics*, 11(1): 85, 2010.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
