To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Semantic Parsers from Denotations with Latent Structured Alignments and Abstract Programs" by Bailin Wang, Ivan Titov, and Mirella Lapata, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on two open-domain question answering datasets, which suggests that specific datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention two datasets:1. **WIKITABLEQUESTIONS**: This dataset contains 2,018 tables and 18,496 utterance-denotation pairs. It is described as challenging due to the variety of operations involved in the questions.2. **WIKISQL**: This dataset has 24,241 tables and 80,654 utterance-denotation pairs. It is noted for being logically simpler compared to WIKITABLEQUESTIONS, focusing on aggregation, column selection, and conditions.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **WIKITABLEQUESTIONS**, the citation is: > P. Pasupat and P. Liang. *Compositional semantic parsing on semi-structured tables*. In Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 1-11, 2015.- For **WIKISQL**, the citation is: > V. Zhong, C. Xiong, and R. Socher. *Seq2SQL: Generating structured queries from natural language using reinforcement learning*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-11, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
