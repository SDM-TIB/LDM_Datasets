To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Feasibility of Embedding Based Automatic Evaluation for Single Document Summarization" by Simeng Sun and Ani Nenkova, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of distributed representations for evaluating summarizers, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention using the **DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets** for benchmarking their methods. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide statistics and results for the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets, indicating that they are the primary datasets used for evaluation. They also mention the **Newsroom dataset** for a contemporary evaluation, which is another dataset relevant to their research.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For **DUC2001**, the citation is: > Lin, C.-Y., & Hovy, E. (2003). Automatic evaluation of summaries using n-gram co-occurrence statistics. In Proceedings of the 2003 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1-7.2. For **DUC2002**, the citation is: > Lin, C.-Y., & Hovy, E. (2003). Automatic evaluation of summaries using n-gram co-occurrence statistics. In Proceedings of the 2003 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1-7.3. For **Newsroom**, the citation is: > Grusky, M., Naaman, M., & Artzi, Y. (2018). Newsroom: A dataset of 1.3 million summaries with diverse extractive strategies. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 708a719.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
