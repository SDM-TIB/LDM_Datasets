To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Role Labeling with Pretrained Language Models for Known and Unknown Predicates" by Daniil Larionov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a Russian semantically annotated corpus, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the **FrameBank corpus** as a resource for supervised training. This indicates that FrameBank is a key dataset used in their experiments.In the **methods section**, the authors describe the preprocessing steps and the filtered dataset they created from FrameBank, which contains annotated text samples with predicates and their semantic roles. They mention that the filtered dataset includes 52,751 examples for 44 unique semantic roles, which is crucial information.I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used for evaluation. The authors refer to the **FrameBank corpus** again, confirming its role in their experiments.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the **FrameBank corpus**. The relevant citation is:- For **FrameBank**, the citation is: > Olga Lyashevskaya and Egor Kashkin. *FrameBank: a database of Russian lexical constructions*. In International Conference on Analysis of Images, Social Networks and Texts, pages 350a360, 2015.Since the paper primarily focuses on the **FrameBank corpus** for their experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset.After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for **FrameBank** in the required format, ensuring that the citation is accurate and complete.
