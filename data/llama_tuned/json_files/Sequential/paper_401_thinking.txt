To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent Variable Sentiment Grammars" by Liwen Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **Stanford Sentiment TreeBank (SST)**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. They state that they used the **Stanford Sentiment TreeBank (SST)** for their experiments, which is a well-known dataset in sentiment analysis.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used, confirming that the **Stanford Sentiment TreeBank (SST)** is the primary dataset utilized in their experiments. They describe the dataset's structure, including how it assigns integer sentiment polarities to constituent nodes in a phrase-structured tree.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Stanford Sentiment TreeBank (SST)**. The citation is as follows:> Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631a1642, 2013. Association for Computational Linguistics.With this information, I have identified the dataset and its citation. I will now compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research paper.
