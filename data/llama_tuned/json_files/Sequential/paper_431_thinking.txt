To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation of Stacked Embeddings for Bulgarian on the Downstream Tasks POS and NER" by Civa Marinova, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of stacked embeddings for Bulgarian NERC and POS tasks, indicating that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the author mentions the availability of manually annotated data from the **BulTreeBank (BTB) Project**. This is a strong indication that a specific dataset is being utilized.In the **experiments section**, the author provides detailed information about the **BulTreeBank (BTB) dataset**, which consists of 14,732 sentences annotated for named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context about its structure and usage.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **BulTreeBank (BTB) dataset**. The citation is as follows:> Kiril Simov, Kiril Simov, Petya Osenova, and Kiril Simov. *BTB-TR04: BulTreeBank morphosyntactic annotation of Bulgarian texts*. Technical report, Technical Report BTB-TR04, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 2004.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the **BulTreeBank (BTB) dataset**. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
