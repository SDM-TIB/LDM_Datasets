To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NLP@UNED at SMM4H 2019: Neural Networks Applied to Automatic Classification of Adverse Effects Mentions in Tweets" by Javier Cortes-Tejada et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the task and the system developed, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **dataset section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their research.In the **dataset section**, the authors mention a publicly available dataset for the task. They describe it as containing 24,606 tweets, with specific annotations for Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR). This indicates that the dataset is crucial for their experiments.Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors refer to the dataset as being publicly available, but they do not provide a specific citation in the text. However, I will note that the dataset is related to the SMM4H Shared Task, which is referenced in the introduction. The citation for the SMM4H Shared Task is:> Davy Weissenbacher, Abeed Sarker, Arjun Magge, Ashlynn Daughton, Karen O'Connor, Michael Paul, and Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez. *Overview of the fourth Social Media Mining for Health Applications (SMM4H) shared task at ACL 2019*. In Proceedings of the 2019 ACL Workshop SMM4H: The 4th Social Media Mining for Health Applications Workshop and Shared Task, pages 1-8, 2019.Since the dataset is publicly available and does not have a specific citation provided in the paper, I will summarize the dataset as follows:1. **Dataset Name**: Twitter Dataset for Adverse Drug Reactions - **Description**: A publicly available dataset containing 24,606 tweets, with annotations indicating the presence or absence of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR). - **Citation**: TwitterGloVe pre-trained word embeddings, as mentioned in the introduction, is used for training the model, but the dataset itself does not have a specific citation provided in the paper.Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the information I have gathered, ensuring to include the relevant details and citations where applicable. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research.
