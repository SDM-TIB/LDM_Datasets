To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Structural Probe for Finding Syntax in Word Representations" by John Hewitt and Christopher D. Manning, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of syntax trees in word representations, which suggests that datasets related to parsing or syntactic analysis may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using the **Penn Treebank** for obtaining word representations of sentences, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.In the **experiments section**, the authors specify that they use the **Penn Treebank** for training their structural probe. This confirms that the dataset is indeed utilized in their experiments.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Penn Treebank**. The citation is as follows:> Mitchell P. Marcus, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, and Beatrice Santorini. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313a330, 1993.Since the paper primarily focuses on the **Penn Treebank** for its word representations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is the **Penn Treebank**, and I will ensure to include its full citation in the output.
