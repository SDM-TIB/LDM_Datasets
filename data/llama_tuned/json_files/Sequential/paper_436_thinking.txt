To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DS at SemEval-2019 Task 9: From Suggestion Mining with neural networks to adversarial cross-domain classification" by Tobias Cabanski, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, data, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the task and may hint at the datasets used, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets.Next, I will focus on the **data section**, which typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets. In this paper, the author mentions two subtasks (A and B) and describes the datasets used for each:1. **Subtask A Dataset**: This dataset consists of 8,500 examples, with 6,415 labeled as non-suggestions and 2,085 labeled as suggestions. It includes a trial dataset with 592 examples, divided into 296 examples for each class. The domain of software suggestion forum posts is noted for its balanced data and specific vocabulary.2. **Subtask B Dataset**: This dataset contains 808 examples, with 404 examples for each class. It is noted that no labeled data is provided for supervised training, and additional unlabeled data is used for cross-domain classification. The author mentions using the hotel review dataset from Wachsmuth et al. (2014) for this task.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Subtask A Dataset**, the citation is: > Sapna Negi, Tobias Daudert, and Paul Buitelaar. *Semeval-2019 task 9: Suggestion mining from online reviews and forums*. In Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), pages 1192a1198, 2019.- For the **Subtask B Dataset**, the citation is: > Henning Wachsmuth, Martin Trenkmann, Benno Stein, Gregor Engels, and Tsvetomira Palakarska. *A review corpus for argumentation analysis*. In Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics, pages 115a127, Berlin Heidelberg New York, Springer, 2014.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
