To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Team Bertha von Suttner at SemEval-2019 Task 4: Hyperpartisan News Detection using ELMo Sentence Representation Convolutional Network" by Ye Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the task and may mention datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, so I will pay close attention to any specific datasets referenced.Next, I will focus on the **data section** (if present) or any subsections that detail the datasets. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets explicitly:1. **By-Publisher Corpus**: This dataset contains 750,000 articles that were automatically classified based on political bias. It is split into a training set of 600,000 articles and a validation set of 150,000 articles.2. **By-Article Corpus**: This dataset consists of 645 manually labeled articles. The authors note that the final evaluation was conducted on a dataset of 628 manually labeled articles.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **By-Publisher Corpus**, the citation is: > Martin Potthast, Johannes Kiesel, Kevin Reinartz, Janek Bevendorff, and Benno Stein. *A stylistic inquiry into hyperpartisan and fake news*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.05638, 2017.- For the **By-Article Corpus**, the citation is: > Martin Potthast, Johannes Kiesel, Kevin Reinartz, Janek Bevendorff, and Benno Stein. *A stylistic inquiry into hyperpartisan and fake news*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.05638, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
