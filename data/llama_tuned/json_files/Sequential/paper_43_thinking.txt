To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning for Causal Sentence Detection" by Manolis Kyriakakis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors focus on detecting causal sentences, which suggests that datasets related to this task will be discussed.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The authors mention the scarcity of causal instances in relation extraction datasets, which implies that they may use specific datasets for their experiments.In the **methods section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection on datasets. The authors mention several datasets used for their experiments, including:1. **SemEval-2010**: This dataset contains 10,674 samples, with 1,325 causal sentences. It is annotated with pairs of entities and their relationship types.2. **CausalTB**: This dataset consists of 2,470 sentences, with 244 causal sentences identified using C-SIGNAL and CLINK tags.3. **EventSL**: This dataset contains 4,107 sentences, with 77 causal sentences detected from the CAUSE and CAUSED BY attributes in the PLOT LINK tags.4. **BioCausal**: This is a biomedical causal sentence detection dataset developed by the authors, containing 13,342 sentences, with 7,562 causal sentences annotated by a single annotator.Finally, I will check the **references section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For **SemEval-2010**, the citation is: > Hendrickx, I., Kim, S. N., Kozareva, Z., Nakov, P., O'SAeghdha, D., PadA, S., Pennacchiotti, M., Romano, L., & Szpakowicz, S. (2009). *SemEval-2010 Task 8: Multi-way classification of semantic relations between pairs of nominals*.

(2014). *Annotating causality in the temporal-3 corpus*.

(2017). *The event storyline corpus: A new benchmark for causal and temporal relation extraction*. In Proceedings of the Events and Stories in the News Workshop, pages 77a86, Vancouver, Canada.- For **BioCausal**, the citation is: > Kyriakakis, M., Androutsopoulos, I., GinAes, J., & Saudabayev, A. (2023). *BioCausal: A biomedical causal sentence detection dataset*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Pages], [Location].After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
