To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection of Social Media Disclosures of Sexual Harassment" by Arijit Ghosh Chowdhurya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the creation of a labeled real-world dataset for identifying social media disclosures of sexual abuse, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **data section** (section 3) where the authors describe the dataset collection process. They mention that they collected anonymized data from Twitter and other microblogging sites, specifically focusing on content related to sexual harassment. This section provides details about the dataset's structure and the methods used for data collection and annotation.In this section, the authors specify that they collected 5,117 tweets, which were manually annotated by human annotators. They also mention that the dataset is publicly available, which is crucial for citation purposes.Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors refer to the dataset as the "Disclosure Language Model" dataset, but they do not provide a specific citation in the references. However, they mention that the dataset is publicly available, which may lead to a citation for the dataset's availability rather than the dataset itself.Since the dataset is publicly available, I will search for the citation in the references related to the dataset's creation or similar datasets. The authors reference other works that may provide context or a citation for the dataset, such as the "Reddit Domestic Abuse Dataset" and "Twitter Sentiment140 Dataset." However, they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset they created.Finally, I will summarize the findings:1. **Dataset Name**: Disclosure Language Model Dataset - This dataset consists of 5,117 tweets collected from Twitter and other microblogging sites, focusing on content related to sexual harassment. The dataset is publicly available for research purposes.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the relevant details and citations for any referenced datasets in the references. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
