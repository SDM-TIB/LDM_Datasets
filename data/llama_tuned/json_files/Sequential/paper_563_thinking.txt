To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lexical Substitution for Evaluating Compositional Distributional Models" by Maja Buljana and Sebastian PadA o, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the creation of a lexical substitution dataset for evaluating compositional distributional models, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the need for a dataset that strikes a balance between artificial and natural data for evaluating compositional distributional models. This suggests that they created a new dataset, which I will need to describe.In the **methods section**, the authors detail the construction of the **ANVAN-LS dataset**. They describe how they extracted phrases from the English CoInCo corpus, which consists of approximately 2,500 sentences from the news and fiction section of the MASC corpus. They also mention that the ANVAN-LS dataset includes 165 ANVAN phrases with an average of 4.4 target words for lexical substitution, totaling 732 target words for lexical substitution.Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the English CoInCo corpus, as it is the source of the ANVAN-LS dataset. The citation for the English CoInCo corpus is:- For **English CoInCo corpus**, the citation is: > Gerhard Kremer, Katrin Erk, Sebastian PadA o, and Stefan Thater. *What substitutes tell us: analysis of an all-wordsa lexical substitution corpus*. In Proceedings of EACL, pages 540a549, 2014. http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/korpora/ANVAN-LS.htmlSince the ANVAN-LS dataset is derived from the English CoInCo corpus, I will include this citation as well.After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both the English CoInCo corpus and the ANVAN-LS dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
