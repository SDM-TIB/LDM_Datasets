To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disney at IEST 2018: Predicting Emotions using an Ensemble" by Wojciech Witon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and task description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the WASSA 2018 shared task, which suggests that a dataset is involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **task description** and **emotion corpus** sections. Here, the authors mention the **WASSA 2018 shared task dataset**, which consists of around 188,000 tweets annotated with 6 emotion labels. This is a clear indication of a dataset used in their experiments.In the **emotion corpus** subsection, the authors provide details about the dataset, stating that it includes 188,000 tweets, with 14,150 for training, 14,900 for validation, and 14,828 for testing. They also mention that the dataset has a balanced distribution of examples for the six emotion labels.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WASSA 2018 shared task dataset. The relevant citation is:- For the **WASSA 2018 shared task dataset**, the citation is: > Roman Klinger, Orph√©e de Clercq, Saif M. Mohammad, and Alexandra Balahur. *IEST: WASSA-2018 implicit emotions shared task*. In Proceedings of the 9th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and citation in a structured format for further processing or review. This will include the dataset name as "WASSA 2018 shared task dataset" and provide a brief description based on the information provided in the paper.
