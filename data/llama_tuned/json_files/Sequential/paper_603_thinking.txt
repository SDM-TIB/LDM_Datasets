To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SemEval-2019 Task 5: A Stacked BiGRU Model Based on Capsule Network in Detection of Hate" by Yunxia Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data processing sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the task involves detecting hate speech on tweets, which suggests that datasets related to tweets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **data processing section** (section 2) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the following datasets:1. **Training Set**: Contains 9,000 tweets labeled as hate speech and 5,217 tweets labeled as non-hate speech.2. **Development Set**: Contains 1,000 tweets labeled as hate speech and 573 tweets labeled as non-hate speech.3. **Test Set**: Contains 2,971 tweets labeled as hate speech and 1,719 tweets labeled with non-hate speech labels.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following reference for the datasets:- For the **SemEval-2019 Task 5**, the citation is: > Valerio Basile, Cristina Bosco, Elisabetta Fersini, Deborah Nozza, Viviana Patti, Francisco Rangel, Paolo Rosso, and Manuela Sanguinetti. *SemEval-2019 Task 5: Multilingual Detection of Hate Speech Against Immigrants and Women in Twitter*. In Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), pages 535a539, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
