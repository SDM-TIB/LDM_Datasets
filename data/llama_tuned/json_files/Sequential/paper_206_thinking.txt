To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Semantic Role Labeling with Cross-View Training" by Rui Cai and Mirella Lapata, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of neural networks for semantic role labeling and mentions the use of benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **CoNLL-2009 benchmark dataset** for their experiments. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.I will also check the **related work section** to see if the authors reference any other datasets that might have been used in their experiments or comparisons. However, the primary dataset mentioned appears to be the CoNLL-2009 benchmark.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their model on the **CoNLL-2009 benchmark dataset**. This confirms its significance in their research.Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the CoNLL-2009 dataset. The citation is as follows:> Bj√∂rkman, Anders, and Bernd Bohnet. "A high-performance syntactic and semantic dependency parser." In Proceedings of the 48th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 33a36, Beijing, China, 2010.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CoNLL-2009 dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the CoNLL-2009 benchmark dataset, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
