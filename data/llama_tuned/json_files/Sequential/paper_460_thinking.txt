To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UNH at SemEval-2019 Task 12: Toponym Resolution in Scientific Papers" by Matthew Magnusson and Laura Dietz, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the task involves toponym resolution in scientific papers, which suggests that a dataset related to scientific texts is involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention a gold standard corpus for their task. They specify that this corpus is composed of 150 full-text journal articles from PubMedCentral (PMC), which is a strong indication of a dataset being used.In the **data section**, the authors provide detailed statistics about the gold standard corpus, confirming its relevance and size. They also mention that additional information can be found at Weissenbacher et al. (2017), which may provide further context or details about the dataset.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the gold standard corpus. The authors reference Weissenbacher et al. (2017) as the source for the corpus, which is crucial for proper citation.The citation for the gold standard corpus is:> Davy Weissenbacher, Abeed Sarker, Tasnia Tahsin, Matthew Scotch, and Graciela Gonzalez. *Extracting geographic locations from the literature for virus phylogeny using supervised and distant supervision methods*. AMIA Jt Summits Transl SciProc, 2017:114a122. 28815119Since the paper primarily focuses on the gold standard corpus for toponym resolution, I will summarize the dataset as follows:- **Gold Standard Corpus**: Composed of 150 full-text journal articles from PubMedCentral (PMC).The citation for this dataset is:> Davy Weissenbacher, Abeed Sarker, Tasnia Tahsin, Matthew Scotch, and Graciela Gonzalez. *Extracting geographic locations from the literature for virus phylogeny using supervised and distant supervision methods*. AMIA Jt Summits Transl SciProc, 2017:114a122. 28815119After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
