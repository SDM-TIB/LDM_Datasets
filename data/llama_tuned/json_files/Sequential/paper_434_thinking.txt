To extract datasets from the research paper titled "YUN-HPCC at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Multi-Step Ensemble Neural Network for Sentiment Analysis in Textual Conversation" by Dawei Li, Jin Wang, and Xuejie Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of deep learning for emotion detection in Twitter conversations, which suggests that datasets related to sentiment analysis may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets used for their experiments. The introduction highlights the challenges of sentiment detection in Twitter and mentions the use of a multi-step ensemble strategy, but it does not specify datasets.In the **experiments section**, I will look for any detailed descriptions of datasets. The authors mention that datasets were provided by SemEval 2019 Task 3, which is a strong indication that a specific dataset is being used. They describe the datasets as consisting of training and development sets, but they do not provide specific names or details about the datasets.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SemEval 2019 Task 3 dataset. The relevant citation is:- For **SemEval 2019 Task 3**, the citation is: > Ankush Chatterjee, Kedhar Nath Narahari, Meghana Joshi, and Puneet Agrawal. *Semeval-2019 task 3: Emocontext: Contextual emotion detection in text*. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), pages 360a364, 2019.Since the paper does not provide specific names for the training and development sets, I will summarize the information as follows:1. **EmoContext Dataset**: This dataset is used for contextual emotion detection in text, consisting of training and development sets with 30,160 and 2,755 samples, respectively. The dataset includes three emotion classes (happy, sad, and angry) and an "others" category.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
