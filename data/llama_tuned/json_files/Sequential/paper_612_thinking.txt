To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Sentence Representations for Propaganda Detection: From Handcrafted Features to Word Embeddings" by AndrA e Ferreira Cruz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the task of sentence-level propaganda detection and mentions a training dataset, which indicates that a dataset is present.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors describe the task and the need for a balanced dataset due to class imbalance. They mention that the provided train dataset consists of 350 articles, which is a significant detail.I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **results** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the provided train dataset in detail, stating that it includes 4,720 sentences, with 4,720 labeled as propaganda and 12,245 labeled as non-propaganda. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset in the text, but they mention that the dataset is part of the NLP4IF shared task. I will look for the NLP4IF shared task citation to provide the necessary context and attribution.The citation for the NLP4IF shared task is:> Giovanni Da San Martino, Seunghak Yu, Alberto BarrA n-CedeEno, Rostislav Petrov, and Preslav Nakov. *Fine-grained analysis of propaganda in news articles*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019, EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019, Hong Kong, China, pages 1-10, 2019.Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset name but refers to the NLP4IF shared task, I will summarize the dataset as follows:- **Propaganda Detection Dataset**: This dataset consists of 350 articles, with 4,720 sentences labeled as propaganda and 12,245 labeled as non-propaganda. The dataset is used for training models to detect propaganda in text.Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and citation from the paper.
