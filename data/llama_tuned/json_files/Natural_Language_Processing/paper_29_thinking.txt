To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Context Enhanced Multi-Domain Dialogue System for Multi-domain Task Completion" by Jingyuan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a dialogue system for multi-domain task completion, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, particularly in the context of dialogue systems.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction discusses the challenges of multi-domain dialogue systems and mentions the need for datasets, but I need to look for specific names.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention the **MultiWOZ dataset** as the primary dataset used for developing their dialogue system. They describe it as a large-scale multi-domain dialogue dataset containing 10,438 dialogues across seven domains related to traveling. This is a clear indication that this dataset is central to their research.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MultiWOZ dataset. The citation is as follows:> Budzianowski, P., Wen, T.-H., Tseng, B.-H., Casanueva, I., Ultes, S., Ramadan, O., & GaEsiA c, M. (2018). Multiwoz-a large-scale multi-domain wizard-of-oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.00278.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details.
