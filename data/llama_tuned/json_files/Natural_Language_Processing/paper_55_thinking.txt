To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BERT for Evidence Retrieval and Claim Verification" by Amir Soleimani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors focus on the FEVER dataset for evidence retrieval and claim verification, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their research.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for more details about the datasets used. The introduction mentions the FEVER dataset as a benchmark for evidence-based claim verification, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their work.I will then look into the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe their approach to the FEVER task. They mention using the FEVER dataset to classify claims and extract evidence sentences, which confirms its importance in their experiments.In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their model on the FEVER dataset, reinforcing its role in their research. This section provides additional context about how the dataset is utilized in their experiments.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the FEVER dataset. The relevant citation is:- For the **FEVER dataset**, the citation is: > James Thorne, Andreas Vlachos, Christos Christodoulopoulos, and Arpit Mittal. *FEVER: A large-scale dataset for fact extraction and verification*. CoRR, abs/1803.05355, 2018.Since the paper primarily focuses on the FEVER dataset, I will compile the information about this dataset, including its description and citation, into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and its citation from the paper.
