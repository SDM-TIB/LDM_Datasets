To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Simple but Effective Method to Incorporate Multi-turn Context with BERT for Conversational Machine Comprehension" by Yasuhito Ohsugi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets, which suggests that I should look for specific names and details in these sections.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to gather more context about the datasets. The authors mention two datasets, **QuAC** and **CoQA**, which are crucial for understanding their contributions to the conversational machine comprehension task. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and any relevant characteristics.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they used **QuAC** and **CoQA** for their evaluations. This confirms that these datasets are central to their research and provides additional context about how they were utilized.In the **references section**, I will look for the full citations of the datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:1. **QuAC**: > Eunsol Choi, He He, Mohit Iyyer, Mark Yatskar, Wen-tau Yih, Yejin Choi, Percy Liang, and Luke Zettle-moyer. *QuAC: Question answering in context*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2174a2184, 2018.2. **CoQA**: > Siva Reddy, Danqi Chen, and Christopher D. Manning. *CoQA: A conversational question answering challenge*. CoRR, abs/1808.07042, 2018.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for proper attribution.
