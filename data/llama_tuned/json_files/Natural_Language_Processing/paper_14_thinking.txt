To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting BERT for End-to-End Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis" by Xin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two review datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they state that they conducted experiments on two review datasets originating from SemEval, specifically referencing the following datasets:1. **LAPTOP**: This dataset is used for the aspect-level sentiment classification task.2. **REST**: Another dataset used for the same purpose, also from SemEval.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide statistics about these datasets, including the number of training and development samples, which confirms their relevance for the study.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **LAPTOP**, the citation is: > Pontiki, M., Galanis, D., Papageorgiou, H., Androutsopoulos, I., Manandhar, S., AL-Smadi, M., Al-Ayyoub, M., Zhao, Y., Qin, B., De Clercq, O., Hoste, V., Apidianaki, M., Tannier, X., Loukachevitch, N., Kotelnikov, E., Bel, N., Jimenez-Zafra, S., and Eryi, G. (2016). *SemEval-2016 task 5: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In SemEval, pages 19a30.- For **REST**, the citation is: > Pontiki, M., Galanis, D., Pavlopoulos, J., Androutsopoulos, I., Papageorgiou, H., Manandhar, S., and AL-Smadi, M. (2015). *SemEval-2015 task 12: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In SemEval, pages 486a495.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
