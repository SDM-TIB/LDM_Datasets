To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Machine Translation with Byte-Level Subwords" by Changhan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of byte-level subwords for machine translation, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **experimental settings section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using three bilingual corpora and one multilingual dataset:1. **English-German (En-De)**: The authors reference the WMT 2014 dataset for this bilingual corpus.2. **Japanese-English (Ja-En)**: They describe using a combination of datasets, specifically mentioning KFTT2, TED3, and JESC for this bilingual corpus.3. **Sinhala-English (Si-En)**: The authors state that they utilize the FLoRes dataset for this bilingual corpus.4. **Many-to-English (X-En)**: They mention using the TED Talks corpus, which includes parallel data for 59 languages, with a specific mention of sampling 22,000 examples from the development set for validation.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For **WMT 2014**, the citation is: > Sennrich, R., Haddow, B., and Birch, A. *Neural machine translation of rare words with subword units*. In Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1-10, 2015.- For **KFTT2**, the citation is: > Neubig, G. *KFTT2: A large-scale Japanese-English parallel corpus*. Available at: http://www.phontron.com/kftt.- For **TED3**, the citation is: > Cettolo, M., Girardi, C., and Federico, M. *WIT3: Web inventory of transcribed and translated talks*. In Proceedings of the Conference of the European Association for Machine Translation, pages 261a268, 2012.- For **JESC**, the citation is: > Pryzant, R., Chung, Y., Jurafsky, D., and Britz, D. *JESC: Japanese-English Subtitle Corpus*. ArXiv e-prints, 2017.- For **FLoRes**, the citation is: > Guzm√°n, F., Chen, P.-J., Ott, M., Pino, J., Lample, G., Koehn, P., Chaudhary, V., and Ranzato, M. *Two new evaluation datasets for low-resource machine translation: Nepali-English and Sinhala-English*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1-10, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
