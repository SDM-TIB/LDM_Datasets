To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Eicient Attention Mechanism for Visual Dialog that can Handle All the Interactions between Multiple Inputs" by Van-Quang Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **VisDial datasets**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their evaluation.Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they used the **VisDial v1.0 dataset** for their experiments, which consists of dialogues with question-answer pairs and captions. This is a clear indication of the dataset's name and purpose.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the VisDial dataset. The citation is as follows:> Das, A., Kottur, S., Gupta, K., Singh, A., Yadav, D., Moura, J.M., Parikh, D., Batra, D. *Visual dialog*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 326a335, 2017.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:1. **VisDial v1.0 Dataset**: This dataset is used for visual dialog tasks, containing dialogues with question-answer pairs and captions. It consists of 123,287 images, 2,064 validation images, and 8,000 test images, with each image having 10 question-answer pairs along with a caption. The dataset includes dense annotations for candidate answers, which is crucial for evaluating visual dialog systems.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation from the paper.
