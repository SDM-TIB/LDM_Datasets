To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MULTIQA: An Empirical Investigation of Generalization and Transfer in Reading Comprehension" by Alon Talmor and Jonathan Berant, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of models on multiple reading comprehension datasets, indicating that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **datasets section** (section 2) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention a total of 10 datasets, which I will enumerate:1. **SQUAD**: A dataset containing 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text.2. **NEWSQA**: A dataset that includes CNN articles and questions generated from them.3. **SEARCHQA**: A dataset that consists of trivia questions and web snippets as contexts.4. **TRIVIAQA**: A dataset that includes trivia questions crawled from the web, with various sources for contexts.5. **HOTPOTQA**: A dataset that requires multi-hop reasoning over Wikipedia paragraphs.6. **CQ**: A dataset that consists of questions generated from Google web queries.7. **CWQ**: A dataset that involves crowd-sourced workers answering questions based on formal queries against Freebase.8. **COMQA**: A dataset that includes real user questions from the WikiAnswers community.9. **DROP**: A dataset that focuses on quantitative reasoning over Wikipedia paragraphs.10. **WIKIHOP**: A dataset that uses entity-relation pairs from Freebase as questions in natural Wikipedia paragraphs.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.The citations I will extract are as follows:- For **SQUAD**, the citation is: > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-10.- For **NEWSQA**, the citation is: > Trischler, A., Wang, T., Yuan, X., Harris, J., Sordoni, A., Bachman, P., & Suleman, K.

W., Salakhutdinov, R., & Manning, C. D. (2018). HotpotQA: A dataset for diverse, explainable multi-hop question answering. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-10.- For **CQ**, the citation is: > Bao, J., Duan, N., Yan, Z., Zhou, M., & Zhao, T. (2016). Constraint-based question answering with knowledge graph.

In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-10.- For **COMQA**, the citation is: > Abujabal, A., Roy, R. S., Yahya, M., & Weikum, G. (2018). COMQA: A community-sourced dataset for complex factoid question answering with paraphrase clusters. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-10.- For **DROP**, the citation is: > Dua, D., Wang, Y., Dasigi, P., Stanovsky, G., Singh, S., & Gardner, M.

Conqueror: Structuring datasets for multi-hop reading comprehension across documents. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-10.With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
