To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Captioning through Image Transformer" by Sen He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of a novel image captioning model and mentions performance on specific datasets, indicating that datasets are likely included.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention the **MSCOCO image captioning dataset** and the **Visual Genome dataset**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their experiments.I will also check the **related work section** to see if there are any additional datasets referenced. The authors mention the **Visual Genome dataset** again, which is used for training their model, and they also reference the **MSCOCO dataset** in the context of their experiments.Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **MSCOCO dataset**, the citation is: > Chen, X., Fang, H., Lin, T.Y., Vedantam, R., Gupta, S., DollÃ¡r, P., & Zitnick, C.L. *Microsoft coco captions: Data collection and evaluation server*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00325, 2015.2. For the **Visual Genome dataset**, the citation is: > Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Kalantidis, Y., Li, L.J., Shamma, D.A., et al. *Visual genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(3): 32a732, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
