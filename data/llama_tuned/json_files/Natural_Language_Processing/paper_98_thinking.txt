To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning in Biomedical Named Entity Recognition: An Evaluation of BERT in the PharmaCoNER task" by Cong Sun and Zhihao Yang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **PharmaCoNER corpus**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their research.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to gather more context about the dataset. The authors mention that the **PharmaCoNER corpus** is a task for recognizing chemical and protein entities from Spanish biomedical texts, which confirms its significance in their evaluation.In the **methods section**, the authors provide details about the **PharmaCoNER corpus**, stating that it has been randomly sampled into three subsets: training, development, and test sets. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and its application in their experiments.I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors mention any other datasets used for comparison or evaluation. However, it appears that the **PharmaCoNER corpus** is the primary dataset utilized in their experiments.Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the **PharmaCoNER corpus**. The citation is as follows:> Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre, Montserrat Marimon, Ander Intxaurrondo, Obdulia Rabal, Marta Villegas, and Martin Krallinger. *PharmaCoNER: Pharmacological substances, compounds and proteins named in Spanish biomedical texts*. In Proceedings of the BioNLP Open Shared Tasks (BioNLP-OST), 2019.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **PharmaCoNER corpus**. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
