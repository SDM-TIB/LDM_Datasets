To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CRAM: Clued Recurrent Attention Model" by Minki Chung and Sungzoon Choa, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed model and its evaluation on two computer vision tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for their experiments. The introduction mentions the use of a CNN-DecNN for saliency detection, which indicates that a dataset is being utilized.I will then examine the **experiments section** (specifically section V) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:1. **MSRA10k Dataset**: This dataset is described as the largest publicly available saliency detection dataset, containing 10,000 annotated saliency images. It is used for training the CNN-DecNN model.2. **Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset**: This dataset is a real-world image dataset for object recognition, containing 73,257 training digits and 26,032 testing digits, all sized at 32x32 in RGB color scale. The authors mention that this dataset is used for the inpainting task.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For the **MSRA10k Dataset**, the citation is: > M.-M. Cheng, N. J. Mitra, X. Huang, P. H. Torr, and S.-M. Hu. *Global contrast based salient region detection*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 37(3):569a582, 2015.- For the **Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset**, the citation is: > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
