To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The MLLP-UPV Spanish-Portuguese and Portuguese-Spanish Machine Translation Systems for WMT19 Similar Language Translation Task" by Pau Baquero-Arnal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the WMT 2019 Shared Task, which suggests that datasets related to machine translation are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods** sections, particularly looking for specific datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors mention using various corpora for their machine translation systems, which indicates that datasets are crucial for their experiments.In the **methods section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets. The authors specify that they used the following corpora for training their systems:1. **JCR**: This dataset is used for the Portuguese-Spanish translation task.2. **Europarl**: Another dataset used for the Portuguese-Spanish translation task.3. **News-Commentary**: This dataset is utilized for the Portuguese-Spanish translation task.4. **Wikititles**: This dataset is also used for the Portuguese-Spanish translation task.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **JCR**, the citation is: > Pau Baquero-Arnal, Javier Iranzo-Sanchez, Jorge Civera, and Alfons Juan. *The MLLP-UPV Spanish-Portuguese and Portuguese-Spanish Machine Translation Systems for WMT19 Similar Language Translation Task*. In Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT19), pages 179a184, 2019.- For **Europarl**, the citation is: > Pau Baquero-Arnal, Javier Iranzo-Sanchez, Jorge Civera, and Alfons Juan. *The MLLP-UPV Spanish-Portuguese and Portuguese-Spanish Machine Translation Systems for WMT19 Similar Language Translation Task*. In Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT19), pages 179a184, 2019.- For **News-Commentary**, the citation is: > Pau Baquero-Arnal, Javier Iranzo-Sanchez, Jorge Civera, and Alfons Juan. *The MLLP-UPV Spanish-Portuguese and Portuguese-Spanish Machine Translation Systems for WMT19 Similar Language Translation Task*. In Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT19), pages 179a184, 2019.- For **Wikititles**, the citation is: > Pau Baquero-Arnal, Javier Iranzo-Sanchez, Jorge Civera, and Alfons Juan. *The MLLP-UPV Spanish-Portuguese and Portuguese-Spanish Machine Translation Systems for WMT19 Similar Language Translation Task*. In Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT19), pages 179a184, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
