To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Patent Landscaping Model Using the Transformer and Graph Embedding" by Seokkyu Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a model for patent landscaping and mention the use of benchmark datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges in patent landscaping and mention the need for benchmark datasets. They also refer to the use of four benchmark datasets for comparing related research studies, which is a strong indication that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.In the **methods section**, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention that they built datasets based on the Korea Intellectual Property Strategy Agency (KISTA) patent trends reports and that they constructed datasets for four technologies listed in Table 1. This indicates that the datasets are derived from KISTA reports, which is a crucial detail for citation purposes.Now, I will look for the **datasets section** or any relevant subsections that provide specific details about the datasets. The authors mention that they built datasets for four technologies: MPUART, MWDFS, MRRG, and GOCS. They provide a summary of the datasets in Table 1, which includes the number of patents and valid patents for each dataset. This information is essential for a comprehensive description.In the **datasets section**, the authors provide a detailed description of each dataset, including the number of patents, valid patents, and the number of CPCs in the valid patent set. This section will likely contain the full citations for the datasets, which is important for proper attribution.After identifying the datasets and their characteristics, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The authors mention that the datasets are based on the KISTA patent trends reports, which are published by the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO). I will look for the citation related to the KISTA reports, as this will be the source of the datasets.The full citation for the KISTA patent trends reports is:> Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO). *Patent trends reports*. Available at: https://www.kipo.go.kr/Next, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as identified. This will include the datasets mentioned in the paper, such as MPUART, MWDFS, MRRG, and GOCS, along with their descriptions and citations.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all relevant information is included, including full citations for each dataset.
