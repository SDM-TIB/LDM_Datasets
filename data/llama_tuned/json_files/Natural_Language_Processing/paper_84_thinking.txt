To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Local Neighboring Structure for Robust 3D Shape Representation" by Zhongpai Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two datasets, which suggests that specific names will be provided.Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they state that they evaluate their model on two datasets: **COMA** and **DFAUST**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for the research.I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **COMA**, the citation is: > Ranjan, A., Bolkart, T., Sanyal, S., & Black, M. J. (2018). Generating 3D Faces using Convolutional Mesh Autoencoders. In The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).- For **DFAUST**, the citation is: > Bogo, F., Romero, J., Loper, M., & Black, M. J. (2017). FAUST: Dataset and evaluation for 3D mesh registration. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations accurately.
