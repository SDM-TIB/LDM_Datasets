To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-tuning BERT for Joint Entity and Relation Extraction in Chinese Medical Text" by Kui Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental studies sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **coronary angiography texts collected from Shuguang Hospital**, which suggests that this is a dataset used in their research.Next, I will focus on the **experimental studies section** where the authors provide details about the dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of **coronary angiography reports**, which includes five types of entities (Body Part, Degree, Quantity, Location, and No Relation) and six types of relations (Negative, Modifier, Position, Percentage, and No Relation). This section provides a clear description of the dataset's structure and content.In the **dataset and evaluation metrics section**, the authors confirm that the dataset is used for their experiments, specifically for the tasks of named entity recognition (NER) and relation classification (RC). They also mention that 85% of the "No Relation" entities were discarded for balance purposes, which is important for understanding the dataset's context.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference their own work, but they do not provide a separate citation for the dataset. However, they do mention that the dataset is collected from **Shuguang Hospital**, which is a key piece of information for citation purposes.The citation for the dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, but I can infer that it is related to the hospital's medical reports. Therefore, I will create a citation based on the context provided in the paper.Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the relevant details, ensuring to include the full citation as accurately as possible. The dataset entry will include the name of the dataset, a brief description, and the citation, which will be formatted correctly for future reference.
