To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Insertion-Deletion Transformer" by Laura Ruisa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the Insertion-Deletion Transformer on synthetic translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention two synthetic translation tasks:1. **Alphabetic Sequence Shifting**: This task involves generating sequences by shifting alphabetic characters. The authors describe the process of generating examples for training and evaluating the model.2. **Caesaras Cipher**: This task involves encrypting sequences using the Caesar cipher method. Similar to the first task, they detail the process of generating examples for training and evaluation.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these tasks are synthetic and not publicly available datasets, I will note that the paper does not provide specific dataset citations. Instead, I will summarize the datasets as follows:- For **Alphabetic Sequence Shifting**, the dataset consists of generated sequences based on shifting alphabetic characters, but no specific citation is provided.- For **Caesaras Cipher**, the dataset consists of encrypted sequences generated using the Caesar cipher method, again without a specific citation.Since these datasets are synthetic and not publicly available, I will not be able to provide full citations. Instead, I will summarize the datasets as follows:1. **Alphabetic Sequence Shifting**: A synthetic dataset generated for training and evaluating the Insertion-Deletion Transformer.2. **Caesaras Cipher**: A synthetic dataset generated for training and evaluating the Insertion-Deletion Transformer.Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I clearly indicate that these datasets are synthetic and do not have formal citations.
