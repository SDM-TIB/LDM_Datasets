To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attentional Speech Recognition Models Misbehave on Out-of-Domain Utterances" by Phillip Keung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the problem of echographic transcription and mentions the use of the **LibriSpeech corpus** and the **British National Corpus (BNC)**, indicating that these are the datasets used in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, they explicitly state that their ASR models were trained on the **960h LibriSpeech corpus**, which is a well-known dataset for automatic speech recognition. They also mention collecting out-of-domain recordings from the **British National Corpus (BNC)**, which contains spontaneous conversations from UK English speakers.In the **results section**, the authors confirm the use of these datasets for their experiments, reinforcing their relevance. Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **LibriSpeech corpus**, the citation is: > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5328-5333, 2015.2. For the **British National Corpus (BNC)**, the citation is: > John Coleman, Ladan Baghai-Ravary, John Pybus, and Sergio Grau. *Audio BNC: the audio edition of the spoken British National Corpus*. Phonetics Laboratory, University of Oxford, 2012.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
