To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Warm-up and Self-Training: Training Strategies of NICT-2 NMT System at WAT-2019" by Kenji Imamura and Eiichiro Sumita, I will follow a systematic approach.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the NICT-2 NMT system and its performance, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the NICT-2 system and its training strategies but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they participated in three tasks: ASPEC.en-ja, ASPEC.ja-en, and TDDC.ja-en. This indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find their names and details.In the **experiments section**, the authors state that the ASPEC tasks use the **Asian Scientific Paper Excerpt Corpus (ASPEC)** and the **Timely Disclosure Documents Corpus (TDDC)**. This is a clear indication of the datasets used.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:1. For **Asian Scientific Paper Excerpt Corpus (ASPEC)**, the citation is: > Toshiaki Nakazawa, Chenchen Ding, Raj Dabre, Hideya Mino, Isao Goto, Win Pa Pa, Nobushige Doi, Yusuke Oda, Anoop Kunchukuttan, Shantipriya Parida, Ondrej Bojar, and Sadao Kurohashi. *ASPEC: In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016)*, pages 2204a2208, Portorož, Slovenia, 2016.2. For **Timely Disclosure Documents Corpus (TDDC)**, the citation is: > Toshiaki Nakazawa, Manabu Yaguchi, Kiyotaka Uchi-moto, Masao Utiyama, Eiichiro Sumita, Sadao Kurohashi, and Hitoshi Isahara. *ASPEC: In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016)*, pages 2204a2208, Portorož, Slovenia, 2016.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
