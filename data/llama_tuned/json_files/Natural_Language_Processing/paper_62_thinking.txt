To extract datasets from the research paper titled "YNU NLP at SemEval-2019 Task 5: Attention and Capsule Ensemble for Identifying Hate Speech" by Bin Wang and Haiyan Ding, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data and system description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the task, but I need to look for specific datasets used for training and evaluation.Next, I will focus on the **data and system description section**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention the official training dataset for the task, which consists of 9000 tweets for training, 1000 tweets for development, and 2971 tweets for testing. They also specify the labels associated with these datasets, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.In the **data description subsection**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:1. **Official Training Dataset**: This dataset contains 9000 tweets for training, with labels indicating hate speech (HS), aggressive behavior (TR), and target classification (AG). The labels are imbalanced, with 5,217 labels of 0 (non-hate speech) and 3,783 labels of 1 (hate speech).2. **Development Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1000 tweets for development, used to evaluate the model's performance before the final test.3. **Final Test Dataset**: This dataset contains 2971 tweets for testing, used to assess the model's performance on unseen data.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the datasets. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the datasets, as they are derived from the official SemEval 2019 Task 5 dataset. Therefore, I will cite the task itself as the source of the datasets:- For the **SemEval 2019 Task 5**, the citation is: > Valerio Basile, Cristina Bosco, Elisabetta Fersini, Deborah Nozza, Viviana Patti, Francisco Rangel, Paolo Rosso, and Manuela Sanguinetti. *Semeval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in Twitter*. In Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), pages 529a534, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the SemEval 2019 Task 5, as it serves as the source of the datasets used in the research.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
