To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HateMonitors: Language Agnostic Abuse Detection in Social Media" by Punyajoy Saha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a machine learning model for hate speech and offensive content detection, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **dataset section** (section 3) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three languages: Hindi, English, and German, and describe the datasets for each language.In this section, the authors provide statistics about the datasets, including the number of training and test samples for each language and subtask. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the **HASOC 2019** dataset, which is a shared task for hate speech and offensive content identification in Indo-European Languages. The citation for this dataset is:> Mandl, T., Modha, S., Patel, D., Dave, M., Mandlia, C., Patel, A. *Overview of the HASOC track at FIRE 2019: Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification in Indo-European Languages*. In Proceedings of the 11th annual meeting of the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (December 2019).Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names for Hindi and English, I will note that they refer to the **HASOC 2019** dataset for both languages, as it is the primary dataset used in their experiments.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the **HASOC 2019** dataset, as it is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
