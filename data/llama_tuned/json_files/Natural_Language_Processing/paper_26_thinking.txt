To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Perspective Inferrer: Reasoning Sentences Relationship from Holistic Perspective" by Zhen Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed Multi-Perspective Inferrer (MPI) model and mentions experiments on two datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4.1), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two datasets:1. **SNLI Dataset**: This dataset consists of 570k sentence pairs, with the premise data sourced from the Flickr30k corpus and the hypothesis data manually composed. The training, development, and test datasets consist of 549,367/9,842/9,824 pairs of sentence pairs.2. **MultiNLI Dataset**: This dataset contains 433k sentence pairs across nine genres, with a focus on in-domain and cross-domain development/test sets. The authors specify that they use the official training/development sets for model selection and test on Kaggle.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:- For the **SNLI Dataset**, the citation is: > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In EMNLP, 2015.- For the **MultiNLI Dataset**, the citation is: > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel R. Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. In NAACL-HLT, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
