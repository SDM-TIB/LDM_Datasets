To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enriching the Transformer with Linguistic Factors for Low-Resource Machine Translation" by Jordi Armengol-Estap et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental framework sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of linguistic factors in machine translation, which suggests that datasets related to translation tasks may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental framework section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention two specific datasets:1. **IWSLT14**: This dataset is used for the German-to-English translation task, specifically for low-resource machine translation. The authors state that the training set contains about 160,000 sentences.2. **FLoRes**: This dataset is used for the English-to-Nepali translation task, which is also considered extremely low-resource. The authors note that it includes 564,000 parallel sentences.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **IWSLT14**, the citation is: > Mauro Cettolo, Jan Niehues, Sebastian Stüker, Luisa Bentivogli, and Marcello Federico. *Report on the 11th IWSLT evaluation campaign*. In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, Hanoi, Vietnam, page 57, 2014.- For **FLoRes**, the citation is: > Francisco Guzmán, Peng-Jen Chen, Myle Ott, Juan Pino, Guillaume Lample, Philipp Koehn, Vishrav Chaudhary, and Marco Aurelio Ranzato. *Two new evaluation datasets for low-resource machine translation: Nepali-English and Sinhala-English*. CoRR, abs/1902.01382, 2019.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
