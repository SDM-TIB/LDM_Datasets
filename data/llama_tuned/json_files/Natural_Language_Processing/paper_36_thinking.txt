To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta Answering for Machine Reading" by Benjamin Borschinger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the framework for meta answering and mentions the **Natural Questions dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to gather more context about the datasets. The authors reference the **Natural Questions dataset** again, confirming its significance in their research. They also mention that this dataset embeds real users' information-seeking needs in a realistic information retrieval context, which provides a clear indication of its purpose.In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they use the **Natural Questions dataset** for their evaluations. This reinforces the dataset's role in their experiments.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Natural Questions dataset**. The citation is as follows:> Tom Kwiatkowski, Jennimaria Palomaki, Olivia Redfield, Michael Collins, Ankur Parikh, Chris Alberti, Danielle Epstein, Illia Polosukhin, Matthew Kelcey, Jacob Devlin, Kenton Lee, Kristina N. Toutanova, Lion Jones, Ming-Wei Chang, Andrew Dai, Jakob Uszkoreit, Quoc Le, and Slav Petrov. *Natural Questions: A Benchmark for Question Answering Research*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 10:1-40, 2019.With this information, I have identified the dataset used in the paper and its citation. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
