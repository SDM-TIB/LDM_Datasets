To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning for Causal Sentence Detection" by Manolis Kyriakakis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors focus on detecting causal sentences, which suggests that datasets related to this task will be discussed.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors mention the scarcity of causal instances in relation extraction datasets, which implies that they may reference specific datasets used for their experiments.In the **methods section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors mention several datasets, including:1. **SemEval-2010**: This dataset contains 10,674 samples, with 1,325 causal sentences. It is annotated with pairs of entities and their relationship types.2. **CausalTB**: This dataset consists of 2,470 sentences, with 244 causal sentences identified using C-SIGNAL and CLINK tags.3. **EventSL**: This dataset contains 4,107 sentences, with 77 causal sentences detected from the CAUSE and CAUSED BY attributes in the PLOT LINK tags.4. **BioCausal**: This is a new biomedical causal sentence detection dataset developed by the authors, containing 13,342 sentences, with 7,562 causal sentences annotated by a single annotator.Finally, I will check the **references section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:- For **SemEval-2010**, the citation is: > Iris Hendrickx, Su Nam Kim, Zornitsa Kozareva, Preslav Nakov, Diarmuid A O SA eaghdha, Sebastian PadA o, Marco Pennacchiotti, Lorenza Romano, and Stan Szpakowicz. *SemEval-2010 Task 8: Multi-way classification of semantic relations between pairs of nominals*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Semantic Evaluations: Recent Achievements and Future Directions, pages 94a99, Boulder, Colorado, 2009.- For **CausalTB**, the citation is: > Paramita Mirza, Rachele Sprugnoli, Sara Tonelli, and Manuela Speranza. *Annotating causality in the temporal-3 corpus*. In Proceedings of the EACL Workshop on Computational Approaches to Causality in Language (CAtoCL), pages 10a19, 2014.- For **EventSL**, the citation is: > Tommaso Caselli and Piek Vossen. *The event storyline corpus: A new benchmark for causal and temporal relation extraction*. In Proceedings of the Events and Stories in the News Workshop, pages 77a86, Vancouver, Canada, 2017.- For **BioCausal**, the citation is: > Manolis Kyriakakis, Ion Androutsopoulos, Joan GinA es i AmetllA e1, Artur Saudabayev. *Transfer Learning for Causal Sentence Detection*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year], [Pages].After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
