To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural language understanding for task-oriented dialogue in the biomedical domain in a low resources context" by Antoine Neuraz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, data generation and augmentation, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of generated training data and mentions a large EHR corpus, which suggests that a dataset is involved.Next, I will focus on the **data generation and augmentation section**. Here, the authors describe the creation of a training dataset using templates and terminologies. They mention that they collected a set of 178 questions annotated manually as a gold standard, which indicates a dataset used for their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors refer to the generated training dataset and the real-world test data. They also mention using a large EHR corpus for incorporating latent knowledge, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:1. For the **EHR corpus**, the citation is: > Wang, Y., Liu, S., Afzal, N., Rastegar-Mojarad, M., Wang, L., Shen, F., Kingsbury, P., & Liu, H. (2018). A comparison of word embeddings for the biomedical natural language processing. *Journal of Biomedical Informatics*, 87, 12-20. doi: 10.1016/j.jbi.2018.09.008. URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046418301825. For the **Paraphrase Database (PPDB)**, the citation is: > Ganitkevitch, J., Van Durme, B., & Callison-Burch, C. (2013). Ppdb: The paraphrase database. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 758a764.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
