To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HLT@SUDA at SemEval 2019 Task 1: UCCA Graph Parsing as Constituent Tree Parsing" by Wei Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a semantic graph parsing approach and mentions the use of datasets for training and evaluation, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe their approach and mention specific datasets used for training and testing their models. They refer to the **English-Wiki data** and **English-20K data** for training, as well as the **German-20K data** and **French-20K data** for evaluation. This is a clear indication of the datasets being utilized in their experiments.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used. They mention that the datasets are provided by the shared task organizer, which suggests that they are publicly available datasets.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:- For the **English-Wiki data**, the citation is: > Daniel Hershcovich, Omri Abend, and Ari Rappoport. *Semeval 2019 task 1: Cross-lingual semantic parsing with UCCA*. arXiv:1903.02953, 2019.- For the **English-20K data**, the citation is: > Daniel Hershcovich, Omri Abend, and Ari Rappoport. *Semeval 2019 task 1: Cross-lingual semantic parsing with UCCA*. arXiv:1903.02953, 2019.- For the **German-20K data**, the citation is: > Daniel Hershcovich, Omri Abend, and Ari Rappoport. *Semeval 2019 task 1: Cross-lingual semantic parsing with UCCA*. arXiv:1903.02953, 2019.- For the **French-20K data**, the citation is: > Daniel Hershcovich, Omri Abend, and Ari Rappoport. *Semeval 2019 task 1: Cross-lingual semantic parsing with UCCA*. arXiv:1903.02953, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
