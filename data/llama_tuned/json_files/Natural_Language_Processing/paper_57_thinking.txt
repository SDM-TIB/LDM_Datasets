To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empirical Evaluation of Sequence-to-Sequence Models for Word Discovery in Low-resource Settings" by Marcely Zanon Boito et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of sequence-to-sequence models for word discovery in low-resource settings, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **experimental settings section** (section 2.2), where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two parallel speech corpora:1. **English-French (EN-FR) Corpus**: This corpus is a 33,192 sentence multilingual extension from Librispeech, with English audiobooks automatically aligned to French translations.2. **Mboshi-French (MB-FR) Corpus**: This corpus is a 5,130 sentence corpus from the language documentation process of Mboshi (Bantu C25), an endangered language spoken in Congo-Brazzaville.In the **references section**, I will look for the full citations for these datasets:- For the **English-French (EN-FR) Corpus**, the citation is: > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audiobooks*. In 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2015), pages 5206a5210, 2015. Available: https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178964- For the **Mboshi-French (MB-FR) Corpus**, the citation is: > P. Godard, M. Zanon Boito, L. Ondel, A. Berard, F. Yvon, A. Villavicencio, and L. Besacier. *Unsupervised word segmentation from speech with attention*. In Interspeech, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
