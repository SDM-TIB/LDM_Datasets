To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT" by Omar Khattab and Matei Zaharia, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on two recent passage search datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** (section 4.1) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:1. **MS MARCO Ranking**: This dataset is a collection of 8.8 million passages from Web pages, gathered from Bing's results to 1 million real-world queries. Each query is associated with sparse relevance judgments of one or a few documents marked as relevant. The authors mention that they use the official development and evaluation sets, which contain roughly 7k queries, and also provide additional validation data.2. **TREC CAR**: This dataset is a synthetic dataset based on Wikipedia, consisting of approximately 29 million passages. The authors specify that they use the first four folds for training and the fifth for validation, resulting in roughly 3 million queries generated by concatenating the title of a Wikipedia page with the heading of one of its sections.The authors also mention that they use the first four folds for training and the fifth for validation, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **MS MARCO**, the citation is: > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A Human-Generated Machine Reading Comprehension Dataset*. 2016.- For **TREC CAR**, the citation is: > Laura Dietz, Manisha Verma, Filip Radlinski, and Nick Craswell. *TREC CAR: A Synthetic Dataset for Complex Answer Retrieval*. In TREC, 2017.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
