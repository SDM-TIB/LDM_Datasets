To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Positional Embedding for Neural Machine Translation" by Kehai Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of recurrent positional embeddings in neural machine translation, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of translation tasks.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that their methods were evaluated on the **WMT14 English-to-German (EN-DE) and NIST Chinese-to-English (ZH-EN) translation tasks**. This indicates that these tasks are based on specific datasets.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used:1. **WMT14 EN-DE Training Set**: This dataset includes 4.43 million bilingual sentence pairs from the WMT14 corpora, with the newstest2013 and newstest2014 data sets used as the development and test sets, respectively.2. **NIST ZH-EN Training Set**: This dataset consists of 1.28 million bilingual sentence pairs from the LDC corpora, specifically using the NIST06 and NIST02/NIST03/NIST04 datasets as the development and test sets, respectively.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **WMT14 EN-DE Training Set**, the citation is: > Sennrich, R., Haddow, B., & Birch, A. (2016). Neural machine translation of rare words with subword units. In Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1715a1725, Berlin, Germany.- For the **NIST ZH-En Training Set**, the citation is: > Chen, K., Wang, R., Utiyama, M., & Sumita, E. I. (2018). Neural machine translation with reordering embeddings. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1787a1799, Florence, Italy.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
