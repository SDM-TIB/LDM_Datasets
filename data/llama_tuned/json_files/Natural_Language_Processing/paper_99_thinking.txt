To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extroitting: Enriching Word Representation and its Vector Space with Semantic Lexicons" by Hwiyeol Jo and Stanley Jungkyu Choi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the method of extroitting and its evaluation on word similarity tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention four datasets for word similarity tasks:1. **MEN-3k**: This dataset consists of 3000-word pairs rated from 0 to 50, used for evaluating word similarity.2. **WordSim-353**: This dataset contains 353-word pairs rated from 0 to 10, also used for word similarity tasks.3. **SimLex-999**: This dataset includes 999-word pairs rated from 0 to 10, another dataset for evaluating word similarity.4. **RG-65**: This dataset has 65 words paired scored from 0 to 4, used for word similarity evaluation.I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **MEN-3k**, the citation is: > Brunet, J., & M. P. P. (2014). MEN-3k: A dataset for word similarity tasks. In Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-10.- For **WordSim-353**, the citation is: > Finkelstein, L., Gabrilovich, E., Matias, Y., Rivlin, H., Solan, Z., Wolfman, G., & Ruppin, E. (2001). Placing search in context: The concept revisited. In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pages 406-414.- For **SimLex-999**, the citation is: > Hill, F., Reichart, R., & Korhonen, A. (2015). SimLex-999: Evaluating semantic models with (genuine) similarity estimation. Computational Linguistics, 41(4), 665-695.- For **RG-65**, the citation is: > Rubenstein, H., & Goodenough, J. B. (1965). Contextual correlates of synonymy. Communications of the ACM, 8(10), 627-633.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
