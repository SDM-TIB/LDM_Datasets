To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Domain Adaptation with BERT-based Domain Classification and Data Selection" by Xiaofei Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their framework on four large public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled **4.1 Datasets**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:1. **SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference Corpus)**: This dataset contains 570k human-written English sentence pairs for natural language inference tasks.2. **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: A crowd-sourced collection of 433k sentence pairs annotated with textual entailment information, covering various genres.3. **QNLI (Question-Answering Natural Language Inference)**: A dataset derived from the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), containing question-paragraph pairs for natural language inference tasks.4. **Quora Question Pairs (QQP)**: A collection of question pairs from the Quora community, used for paraphrase detection.After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:- For **SNLI**, the citation is: > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-10, 2015.- For **MNLI**, the citation is: > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel R. Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1112-1122, 2017.- For **QNLI**, the citation is: > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-10, 2016.- For **Quora Question Pairs (QQP)**, the citation is: > Zhen Wang, Amapreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel R. Bowman. *GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-10, 2018.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
