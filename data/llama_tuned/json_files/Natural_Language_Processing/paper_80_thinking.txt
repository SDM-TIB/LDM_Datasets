To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Machine Translation with Dependency-Aware Self-Attention" by Emanuele Bugliarello and Naoaki Okazaki, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of various translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention several datasets, including:1. **News Commentary v11 (NC11)**: This dataset is used for simulating low-resource translation tasks.2. **WMT16 English-Deutsch (En-De)**: A standard dataset for machine translation tasks.3. **WMT17 English-Deutsch (En-De)**: Another standard dataset for machine translation.4. **WMT18 English-Turkish (En-Tr)**: A low-resource dataset for machine translation.5. **WAT English-Japanese (En-Ja)**: A dataset used for evaluating the proposed method on long sentences and in low-resource scenarios.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:- For **News Commentary v11 (NC11)**, the citation is: > Joost Bastings, Ivan Titov, Wilker Aziz, Diego Marcheggiani, and Khalil Simaan. *Graph Convolutional Encoders for Syntax-aware Neural Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Machine Translation Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1957a1967, 2017.- For **WMT16 English-Deutsch (En-De)**, the citation is: > WMT16. *WMT16 English-Deutsch Translation Task*. 2016.- For **WMT17 English-Deutsch (En-De)**, the citation is: > WMT17. *WMT17 English-Deutsch Translation Task*. 2017.- For **WMT18 English-Turkish (En-Tr)**, the citation is: > WMT18. *WMT18 English-Turkish Translation Task*. 2018.- For **WAT English-Japanese (En-Ja)**, the citation is: > WAT. *WAT English-Japanese Translation Task*. 2018.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
