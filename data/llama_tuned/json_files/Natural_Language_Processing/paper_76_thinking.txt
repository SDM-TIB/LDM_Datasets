To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scheduled Sampling for Transformers" by Tsvetomila Mihaylova and AndrA e F. T. Martins, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of scheduled sampling in Transformer models, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using the **IWSLT 2017 GermanaEnglish dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their work.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the IWSLT 2017 dataset. The citation is as follows:> Mauro Cettolo, Marcello Federico, Luisa Bentivogli, Niehues Jan, StA uker Sebastian, Sudoh Katsuitho, Yoshino Koichiro, and Federmann Christian. *Overview of the IWSLT 2017 evaluation campaign*. In International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, pages 2a14, 2017.Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset name and its citation from the paper.
