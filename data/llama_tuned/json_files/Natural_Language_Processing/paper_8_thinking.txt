To extract datasets from the research paper titled "XQA: A Cross-lingual Open-domain Question Answering Dataset" by Jiahua Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a novel dataset for cross-lingual OpenQA, which suggests that a specific dataset is being introduced.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the need for cross-lingual OpenQA and mention the dataset they created. They refer to it as the **XQA dataset**, which consists of a training set in English and development and test sets in eight other languages. This is a clear indication that this dataset is central to their research.In the **methodology section**, the authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of question-answer pairs and the languages involved. They mention that the training set contains 56,279 English question-answer pairs, while the development and test sets contain 17,358 and 16,973 question-answer pairs, respectively. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the XQA dataset. The authors mention that the dataset is publicly available at a specific GitHub repository, which is a common practice for datasets. The citation for the XQA dataset is:> Jiahua Liu, Yankai Lin, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun. *XQA: A Cross-lingual Open-domain Question Answering Dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.11515, 2020.Since the XQA dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the XQA dataset, ensuring that it includes all relevant details such as the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
