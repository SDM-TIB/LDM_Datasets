To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Alternative Weighting Schemes for ELMo Embeddings" by Nils Reimers and Iryna Gurevych, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of different weighting schemes for ELMo embeddings, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they list several datasets, including:1. **ACE Entities/Events**: This dataset consists of 599 annotated documents from six different domains, used for event detection or entity detection.2. **POS**: The authors use part-of-speech tags from Universal Dependencies v. 1.3 for English, specifically focusing on the first 500 sentences for training.3. **Chunking**: The CoNLL 2000 shared task dataset is referenced for chunking tasks.4. **NER**: The CoNLL 2003 shared task dataset is used for named entity recognition.5. **GENIA NER**: This dataset is annotated for bio-entity recognition, consisting of 2000 abstracts for training and 404 for testing.6. **WNUT16**: This dataset is a shared task on named entity recognition over Twitter, containing 2,394 annotated tweets for training, 1,000 for development, and 3,856 for testing.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For **ACE Entities/Events**, the citation is: > Christopher Walker, Stephanie Strassel, Julie Medero, and Kazuaki Maeda. *ACE 2005 Multilingual Training Corpus*. LDC Catalog No.: LDC2006T06.- For **POS**, the citation is: > Universal Dependencies v. 1.3. Available at: https://github.com/hunkim/universal-dep.- For **Chunking**, the citation is: > CoNLL 2000 shared task dataset. Available at: https://www.conll-sjol.com/corpora/corpora.php?lang=en.- For **NER**, the citation is: > CoNLL 2003 shared task dataset. Available at: https://www.conll-sjol.com/corpora/corpora.php?lang=en.- For **GENIA NER**, the citation is: > Jin-Dong Kim, Tomoko Ohta, Yoshimasa Tsuruoka, Yuka Tateisi, and Nigel Collier. *Introduction to the bio-entity recognition task at JNLPBA*. In Proceedings of the 2004 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), pages 70–75, 2004. http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-1213.- For **WNUT16**, the citation is: > Benjamin Strauss, Bethany Toma, Alan Ritter, Marie-Catherine de Marneffe, and Wei Xu. *Results of the WNUT16 Named Entity Recognition SharedTask*. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text (WNUT), pages 138–144, 2016. The COLING 2016 Organizing Committee.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
