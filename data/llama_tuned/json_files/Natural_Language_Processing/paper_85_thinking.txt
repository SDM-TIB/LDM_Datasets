To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention is Not Only a Weight: Analyzing Transformers with Vector Norms" by Goro Kobayashi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the analysis of attention mechanisms in Transformers, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of BERT and NMT systems.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their analyses. In this paper, I will look for specific datasets related to the experiments conducted, such as the BERT dataset and any other datasets mentioned in the context of NMT systems.In the **experiments section**, I find that the authors used the **Europarl v7 corpus** for their NMT experiments and the **BERT-base dataset** for their analysis of BERT. I will also check the **references section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **Europarl v7 corpus**, the citation is: > David J. Whitehead, et al. *Europarl v7: A Large-Scale Parallel Corpus for Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (NAACL-HLT), pages 1-8, 2016.2. For the **BERT-base dataset**, the citation is: > Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova. *BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (NAACL-HLT), pages 4171-4186, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
