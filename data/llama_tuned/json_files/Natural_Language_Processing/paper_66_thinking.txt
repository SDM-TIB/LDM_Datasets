To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Generalized Framework of Sequence Generation with Application to Undirected Sequence Models" by Elman Mansimov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed framework to undirected sequence models, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of machine translation.Next, I will focus on the **experimental settings section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using a translation-variant of BERT for machine translation tasks, specifically referencing the **WMTa14 English-German translation dataset**. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, as it consists of 4.5 million parallel sentence pairs.I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the WMTa14 dataset. The citation is as follows:> Lample, G., & Conneau, A. (2019). Cross-lingual language model pretraining. arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.07291.Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the WMTa14 dataset.Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the WMTa14 dataset, ensuring that it is clear and ready for any further processing or review.
