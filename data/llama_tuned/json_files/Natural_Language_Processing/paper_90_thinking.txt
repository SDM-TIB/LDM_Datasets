To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transforming Delete, Retrieve, Generate Approach for Controlled TextStyle Transfer" by Akhilesh Sudhakar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using several datasets for their style transfer tasks. The datasets listed are:1. **YELP**: This dataset consists of reviews of businesses on Yelp, with each review labeled as having either positive or negative sentiment.2. **AMAZON**: This dataset contains product reviews on Amazon, also labeled for sentiment.3. **CAPTIONS**: This dataset includes image captions, where each caption is labeled as factual, romantic, or humorous.4. **POLITICAL**: This dataset consists of top-level comments on Facebook posts from members of the United States Senate and House, labeled by political affiliation.5. **GENDER**: This dataset contains reviews of food businesses on Yelp, labeled by gender.After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:- For **YELP**, the citation is: > Li, J., Jia, R., He, H., & Liang, P. (2018). Delete, retrieve, generate: a simple approach to sentiment and style transfer. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1865a1874, New Orleans, Louisiana.- For **AMAZON**, the citation is: > Li, J., Jia, R., He, H., & Liang, P. (2018). Delete, retrieve, generate: a simple approach to sentiment and style transfer. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1865a1874, New Orleans, Louisiana.- For **CAPTIONS**, the citation is: > Li, J., Jia, R., He, H., & Liang, P. (2018). Delete, retrieve, generate: a simple approach to sentiment and style transfer. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1865a1874, New Orleans, Louisiana.- For **POLITICAL**, the citation is: > Prabhumoye, S., Tsvetkov, Y., Salakhutdinov, R. S., & Black, A. W. (2018). Transfer through back-translation. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1865a1874, New Orleans, Louisiana.- For **GENDER**, the citation is: > Reddy, S., & Knight, K. (2016). Obfuscating gender in social media writing. In Proceedings of the First Workshop on NLP and Computational Social Science, pages 17a26, Austin, Texas.After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
