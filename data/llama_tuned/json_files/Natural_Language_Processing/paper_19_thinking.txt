To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KU AI at MEDIQA 2019: Domain-specific Pre-training and Transfer Learning for Medical NLI" by Mil Cengiz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **MedNLI dataset** for their experiments, which is a strong starting point.Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional datasets that may be referenced. The authors mention using **MultiNLI** and **SNLI** datasets to improve their model's performance, which suggests these datasets are also relevant.In the **methods section**, I will look for specific details about how these datasets were utilized. The authors describe the **MedNLI dataset** as being created from clinical notes and limited in size, which is crucial for understanding its context. They also mention using **MultiNLI** and **SNLI** for transfer learning, confirming their importance in the experiments.Now, I will check the **references section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:1. For **MedNLI**, the citation is: > Alexey Romanov and Chaitanya Shivade. *Lessons from natural language inference in the clinical domain*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1586a1596, 2018.2. For **MultiNLI**, the citation is: > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), 2018.3. For **SNLI**, the citation is: > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2015.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
