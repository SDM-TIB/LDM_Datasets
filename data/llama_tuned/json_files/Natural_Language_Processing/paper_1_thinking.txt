To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PAWS-X: A Cross-lingual Adversarial Dataset for Paraphrase Identification" by Yinfei Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a new dataset, PAWS-X, which suggests that this is a primary dataset of interest.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to gather more context about the dataset. The authors mention that PAWS-X is an extension of the original PAWS dataset, which consists of challenging paraphrase identification pairs from Wikipedia and Quora. This indicates that PAWS-X is a derived dataset from PAWS.I will then examine the **methodology section** to see if the authors provide additional details about the dataset, such as the number of pairs, languages included, and any specific characteristics of the dataset. The authors describe PAWS-X as containing 23,659 human translated evaluation pairs in six languages: French, Spanish, German, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.Now, I will look for the **references section** to find the full citation for the original PAWS dataset. The authors reference the original PAWS dataset in the introduction, which is crucial for providing a complete citation.The citation for the original PAWS dataset is:> Yuan Zhang, Jason Baldridge, and Luheng He. *PAWS: Paraphrase Adversaries from Word Scrambling*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 1298a1308, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019.After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified:1. **PAWS**: The original dataset used as a basis for PAWS-X, consisting of challenging paraphrase identification pairs from Wikipedia and Quora.2. **PAWS-X**: The new dataset created by the authors, containing 23,659 human translated evaluation pairs in six languages: French, Spanish, German, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
