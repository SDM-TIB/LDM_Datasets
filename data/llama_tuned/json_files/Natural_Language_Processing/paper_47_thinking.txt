To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Token-Level Ensemble Distillation for Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion" by Hao Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **CMU-Dict dataset and an internal English dataset**, which suggests that these are the datasets used.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets. Here, they explicitly mention:1. **CMU-Dict 0.7b**: This dataset is described as publicly available and is used for evaluating the proposed method. The authors provide details about the split for training, validation, and testing, which is crucial for understanding its structure.2. **Internal English Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 184,243 training words, 10,837 validation words, and 21,678 test words. They also mention the sizes of the grapheme and phoneme vocabularies, which is important for understanding the dataset's characteristics.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **CMU-Dict 0.7b**, the citation is: > B. Milde, C. Schmidt, and J. KÃ¶hler. *Multitask sequence-to-sequence models for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion*. In INTERSPEECH, 2017, pp. 2536a2540.- For the **Internal English Dataset**, since it is not a publicly available dataset, I will note that it is an internal dataset created by the authors of this paper, and I will document it as such. Since it does not have a formal citation, I will indicate that it is an original dataset created by the authors.Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the CMU-Dict dataset and provide a description of the internal dataset as described in the paper. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
