To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Microsoft Translator at WMT 2019: Towards Large-Scale Document-Level Neural Machine Translation" by Marcin Junczys-Dowmunt, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the Microsoft Translator's submissions to the WMT19 news translation shared task, which suggests that datasets related to translation tasks may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the use of large-scale data created via data-filtration and noisy back-translation, which indicates that datasets related to translation data are likely used. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation, including:1. **Europarl**: A dataset used for document-level machine translation, specifically for the WMT19 shared task.2. **Rapid**: Another dataset used for document-level machine translation, also part of the WMT19 shared task.3. **News-Commentary**: A dataset used for document-level machine translation, included in the WMT19 shared task.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **Europarl**, the citation is: > Ondˇej Bojar, Christian Federmann, Mark Fishel, Yvette Graham, Barry Haddow, Matthias Huck, Philipp Koehn, Christof Monz, Mathias Müller, and Matt Post. *Findings of the 2019 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT19)*. In Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Machine Translation, Volume 2: Shared Task Papers, pages 1-12, 2019.- For **Rapid**, the citation is: > Ondˇej Bojar, Christian Federmann, Mark Fishel, Yvette Graham, Barry Haddow, Matthias Huck, Philipp Koehn, Christof Monz, Mathias Müller, and Matt Post. *Findings of the 2019 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT19)*. In Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Machine Translation, Volume 2: Shared Task Papers, pages 1-12, 2019.- For **News-Commentary**, the citation is: > Ondˇej Bojar, Christian Federmann, Mark Fishel, Yvette Graham, Barry Haddow, Matthias Huck, Philipp Koehn, Christof Monz, Mathias Müller, and Matt Post. *Findings of the 2019 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT19)*. In Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Machine Translation, Volume 2: Shared Task Papers, pages 1-12, 2019.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
