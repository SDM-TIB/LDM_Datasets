To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving the Performance of Online Neural Transducer Models" by Tara N. Sainath et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental details sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses improvements to the Neural Transducer model, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experimental details section** where datasets are typically described.In the **experimental details section**, the authors mention that their experiments are conducted on a **12,500 hour Voice Search task**. This indicates that the dataset is related to speech recognition and is used for training and evaluation of their models.Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset, such as its source, size, and any preprocessing steps. The authors state that the dataset consists of **15 million English utterances** and that it is created by artificially corrupting clean utterances to simulate real-world conditions. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and purpose.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the Voice Search dataset, as it appears to be a custom dataset created for the study. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is derived from Google's voice search traffic, but I will need to provide a citation for the source of the data, which is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the Voice Search dataset, I will summarize the dataset as follows:- **Voice Search Dataset**: A custom dataset consisting of 15 million English utterances, created by artificially corrupting clean utterances to simulate real-world conditions, derived from Google's voice search traffic.Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and its context within the paper.
