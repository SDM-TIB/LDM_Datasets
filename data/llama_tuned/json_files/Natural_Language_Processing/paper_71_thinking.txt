To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Train, Sort, Explain: Learning to Diagnose Translation Models" by Robert Schwarzenberg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of translation models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, particularly in the context of machine translation.Next, I will focus on the **datasets section** (section 4) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to the **WMT14 data setup** and the **WMT18 training data**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.In the **datasets section**, the authors provide details about the datasets:1. **WMT14 Data Setup**: This dataset is used for training and evaluating machine translation models. It is a benchmark dataset for machine translation tasks.2. **WMT18 Training Data**: This dataset is used for training the neural text classifier in the proposed approach. It includes human and machine translations alongside their sources, totaling 1 million training samples.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **WMT14**, the citation is: > Ondrej Bojar, Christian Buck, Christian Federmann, Barry Haddow, Philipp Koehn, Johannes Leveling, Christof Monz, Pavel Pecina, Matt Post, Herve Saint-Amand, Radu Soricut, Lucia Specia, and AleEs Tamchyna. *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 12a58, Baltimore, Maryland, USA, 2014.- For **WMT18**, the citation is: > Ondrej Bojar, Christian Federmann, Mark Fishel, Yvette Graham, Barry Haddow, Matthias Huck, Philipp Koehn, and Christof Monz. *Findings of the 2018 conference on machine translation*. In Proceedings of the Third Conference on Machine Translation, Volume 2: Shared Task Papers, pages 272a307, Belgium, Brussels, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
