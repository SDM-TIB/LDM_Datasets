To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TENER: Adapting Transformer Encoder for Named Entity Recognition" by Hang Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on six NER datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention six NER datasets:1. **CoNLL2003**: This is a well-known English NER dataset that contains four different named entities: PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, and MISC.2. **OntoNotes 5.0**: This dataset is derived from various domains, including telephone conversations and news articles, and includes eleven entity names and seven value types.3. **OntoNotes 4.0**: This dataset is used for Chinese NER and is derived from news articles.4. **MSRA**: This dataset is specifically designed for Chinese NER and contains a large number of training examples.5. **Weibo NER**: This dataset is built from text data from Chinese social media and includes four types of entities.6. **Resume NER**: This dataset is annotated for Chinese NER and contains various entity types.Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:- For **CoNLL2003**, the citation is: > Erik F. Tjong Kim Sang and Fien De Meulder. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the 2003 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 142a147, 2003.- For **OntoNotes 5.0**, the citation is: > Chuanhai Dong, Jiajun Zhang, Chengqing Zong, Masanori Hattori, and Hui Di. *Character-based LSTM-CRF with radical-level features for Chinese named entity recognition*. In NLPCC, pages 239a250, 2016.- For **OntoNotes 4.0**, the citation is: > Ralph Weischedel. *OntoNotes release 4.0*. LDC, 2011.- For **MSRA**, the citation is: > Gina-Anne Levow. *The third international Chinese language processing bakeoff: Word segmentation and named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the Fifth Workshop on Chinese Language Processing, SIGHAN@COLING/ACL 2006, Sydney, Australia, July 22-23, 2006, pages 108a117.- For **Weibo NER**, the citation is: > Nanyun Peng and Mark Dredze. *Named entity recognition for Chinese social media with jointly trained embeddings*. In EMNLP, pages 548a554, 2015.- For **Resume NER**, the citation is: > Yue Zhang, Qi Liu, and Linfeng Song. *Sentence In ACL (1)*. In ACL, pages 317a327, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
