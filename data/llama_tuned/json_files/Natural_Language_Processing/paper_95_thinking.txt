To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enriching Word Vectors with Subword Information" by Piotr Bojanowski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of word representations on various languages, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 4.2) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets for evaluating their word representations across different languages. The datasets include:1. **WS353 Dataset**: This dataset is used for word similarity tasks.2. **GUR65 Dataset**: Used for evaluating word similarity in German.3. **GUR350 Dataset**: Another dataset for word similarity in German.4. **ZG222 Dataset**: Also used for word similarity in German.5. **RW Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating word similarity in English.6. **RG65 Dataset**: Used for evaluating word similarity in French.7. **HJ Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating word similarity in Russian.Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **WS353 Dataset**, the citation is: > Lev Finkelstein, Evgeniy Gabrilovich, Yossi Matias, Ehud Rivlin, Zach Solan, Gadi Wolfman, and Eytan Ruppin. *Placing search in context: The concept revisited*. In Proceedings of the 2001 World Wide Web Conference (WWW), pages 1-10, 2001.- For **GUR65 Dataset**, the citation is: > Iryna Gurevych. *Using the structure of a conceptual network in computing semantic relatedness*. In Proceedings of the 2005 International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP), pages 1-8, 2005.- For **GUR350 Dataset**, the citation is: > Iryna Gurevych. *Using the structure of a conceptual network in computing semantic relatedness*. In Proceedings of the 2005 International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP), pages 1-8, 2005.- For **ZG222 Dataset**, the citation is: > Iryna Gurevych. *Using the structure of a conceptual network in computing semantic relatedness*. In Proceedings of the 2005 International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP), pages 1-8, 2005.- For **RW Dataset**, the citation is: > Minh-Thang Luong, Richard Socher, and Christopher D. Manning. *Better word representations with recursive neural networks for morphology*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (CoNLL), pages 1-10, 2013.- For **RG65 Dataset**, the citation is: > Colette Joubarne and Diana Inkpen. *Comparison of semantic similarity for different languages using the Google n-gram corpus and second-order co-occurrence measures*. In Proceedings of the 2011 Canadian Conference on Artificial Intelligence (CCAI), pages 1-8, 2011.- For **HJ Dataset**, the citation is: > Alexander Panchenko, Dmitry Ustalov, Nikolay Arefyev, Denis Paperno, Natalia Konstantinova, Natalia Loukachevitch, and Chris Biemann. *Man and machine judgments for Russian semantic relatedness*. In Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pages 1-10, 2016.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
