To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distantly-Supervised Neural Relation Extraction with Side Information using BERT" by Johny Moreira et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they refer to the **Google Distant Supervision (GDS)** and **Riedel datasets**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the GDS dataset as an extension of the Google relation extraction corpus with additional instances from entity pairs, and the Riedel dataset was developed by aligning Freebase relations with the New York Times (NYT) corpus. This information is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of each dataset.Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:1. For the **Google Distant Supervision (GDS)**, the citation is: > S. Jat, S. Khandelwal, and P. Talukdar. *Improving Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction using Word and Entity Based Attention*. http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.069872. For the **Riedel dataset**, the citation is: > S. Riedel, L. Yao, and A. McCallum. *Modeling Relations and Their Mentions without Labeled Text*. Proceedings of the 2010 European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases: Part III, pp. 148a163.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
