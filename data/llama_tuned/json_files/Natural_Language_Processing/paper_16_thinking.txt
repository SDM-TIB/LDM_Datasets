To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Second Conversational Intelligence Challenge (ConvAI2)" by Emily Dinan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the ConvAI2 competition and mentions the use of a dataset called **Persona-Chat**, which indicates that this is a key dataset for the research.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methodology sections** to gather more details about the datasets. In the introduction, the authors describe the Persona-Chat dataset, which consists of conversations between crowdworkers who were randomly paired and asked to act as a given persona. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.In the **methodology section**, the authors provide additional details about the Persona-Chat dataset, including its structure and the number of examples. They also mention that the ConvAI2 dataset is based on the Persona-Chat dataset, which confirms its significance in their research.Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Persona-Chat dataset. The citation is as follows:> Saizheng Zhang, Emily Dinan, Jack Urbanek, Arthur Szlam, Douwe Kiela, and Jason Weston. *Personalizing dialogue agents: I have a dog, do you have pets too?*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.07243, 2018.Since the ConvAI2 dataset is based on Persona-Chat, I will also include this citation as it is relevant to the ConvAI2 dataset:- For **Persona-Chat**, the citation is the same as above:> Saizheng Zhang, Emily Dinan, Jack Urbanek, Arthur Szlam, Douwe Kiela, and Jason Weston. *Personalizing dialogue agents: I have a dog, do you have pets too?*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.07243, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets as they are crucial for proper attribution and reference in future work. This systematic approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper.
