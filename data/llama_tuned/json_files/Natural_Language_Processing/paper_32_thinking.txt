To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Morphology-Aware Word-Segmentation in Dialectal Arabic Adaptation of Neural Machine Translation" by Ahmed Y. Tawfik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of parallel corpora for machine translation, which suggests that datasets related to Arabic dialects may be involved.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the scarcity of parallel corpora for dialectal Arabic and the need for using Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) resources. This indicates that datasets related to Arabic dialects are likely referenced later in the paper.In the **methods section**, the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention several datasets, including:1. **LDC-ArabicTreebank (LDC2010T08, LDC2010T13, and LDC2011T09)**: These datasets are used for training the unified dialectal Arabic segmenter.2. **LDC2016T02, LDC2016T18, and LDC2018T23**: These datasets are also part of the training data for the dialectal segmenter, specifically for the Egyptian, Levantine, and Gulf Arabic dialects.3. **Crowd sourced translations for Levantine and Egyptian (LDC2012T09)**: This dataset is used for training the machine translation models for these dialects.4. **BOLT Egyptian Arabic parallel discussion forums data (LDC2019T01)**: This dataset is another resource for training the machine translation models for Egyptian Arabic.5. **Qatari Arabic Corpus**: This dataset includes English translations for several hours of Qatari TV broadcast conversations, which is utilized for training the machine translation models for the Gulf Arabic dialect.Next, I will check the **references section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:1. For **LDC-ArabicTreebank**, the citation is: > Younes Samih, Mohamed Eldesouki, Mohammed Atia, Kareem Darwish, Ahmed Abdelali, Hamdy Mubarak, and Laura Kallmeyer. *Learning from relatives: unified dialectal Arabic segmentation*. In Proceedings of the 21st Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL2017), pages 432a441, 2017.2. For **LDC2016T02, LDC2016T18, and LDC2018T23**, the citation is: > Younes Samih, Mohamed Eldesouki, Mohammed Atia, Kareem Darwish, Ahmed Abdelali, Hamdy Mubarak, and Laura Kallmeyer. *Learning from relatives: unified dialectal Arabic segmentation*. In Proceedings of the 21st Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL2017), pages 432a441, 2017.3. For **LDC2012T09**, the citation is: > Rabih Zbib, Erika Malchiodi, Jacob Devlin, David Stallard, Spyros Matsoukas, Richard Schwartz, John Makhoul, Omar F. Zaidan, and Chris Callison-Burch. *Machine translation of Arabic dialects*. In Proceedings of the 2012 conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 49a59, 2012.4. For **LDC2019T01**, the citation is: > Rabih Zbib, Erika Malchiodi, Jacob Devlin, David Stallard, Spyros Matsoukas, Richard Schwartz, John Makhoul, Omar F. Zaidan, and Chris Callison-Burch. *Machine translation of Arabic dialects*. In Proceedings of the 2012 conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 49a59, 2012.5. For **Qatari Arabic Corpus**, the citation is: > Robert Parker, David Graff, Ke Chen, Junbo Kong, and Kazuaki Maeda. *Arabic gigaword*. 2009.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
