To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reverse, Retrieve, and Rank for Sarcasm Generation with Commonsense Knowledge" by Tuhin Chakrabarty et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets accurately.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of unsupervised approaches for sarcasm generation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved, particularly in the context of evaluation.Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention two datasets:1. **Multi-Genre NLI Dataset**: This dataset is used for training a model for natural language inference tasks. It is a broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference.2. **Sarcasm Dataset**: The authors also reference a dataset of 4,762 pairs of speakers' sarcastic messages and hearers' interpretations, collected through a crowdsourcing experiment. This dataset is crucial for evaluating their sarcasm generation model.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For the **Multi-Genre NLI Dataset**, the citation is: > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1-10, 2018.- For the **Sarcasm Dataset**, the citation is: > Debanjan Ghosh, Alexander R Fabbri, and Smaranda Muresan. *Sarcasm analysis using conversation context*. Computational Linguistics, 44(4):755a792, 2018.After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
