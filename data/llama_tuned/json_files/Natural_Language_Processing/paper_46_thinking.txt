To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards a better understanding of VectorQuantized Autoencoders" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of VQ-VAE on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for image generation tasks and the **WMT English-German translation task** for machine translation. This is a good starting point for dataset extraction.In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets used:1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset is commonly used for image classification tasks. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.2. **WMT English-German Translation Task**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks, specifically for training and evaluating translation models. It includes a large corpus of text data for English to German translation.I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is: > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.- For **WMT English-German Translation Task**, the citation is: > Aukasz Kaiser, Aurko Roy, Ashish Vaswani, Niki Pamar, Samy Bengio, Jakob Uszkoreit, and Noam Shazeer. *Fast decoding in sequence models using discrete latent variables*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.03382, 2018.Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
