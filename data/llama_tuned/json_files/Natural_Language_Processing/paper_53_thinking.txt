To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cost-Sensitive BERT for Generalisable Sentence Classification with Imbalanced Data" by Harish Tayyar Madabushi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their methods on the **Propaganda Techniques Corpus (PTC)**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their research.Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methods sections** to gather more details about the dataset. In the introduction, the authors mention the PTC dataset in the context of propaganda detection, confirming its significance in their experiments.In the **methods section**, they provide a detailed description of the PTC dataset, including the number of news articles, sentences, and the specific tasks they used it for (sentence-level classification and fragment-level classification). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and application.I will also check the **dataset description** subsection to confirm the details provided about the PTC dataset, such as the number of training, development, and test sets, as well as the labeling process. This will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the dataset.Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the PTC dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:- For the **Propaganda Techniques Corpus (PTC)**, the citation is: > Giovanni Da San Martino, Seunghak Yu, Alberto Barrón-Cedeño, Rostislav Petrov, and Preslav Nakov. *Fine-grained analysis of propaganda in news articles*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019), pages 1-10, Hong Kong, China, November 3-7, 2019.After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry for the PTC into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
