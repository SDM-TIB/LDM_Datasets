To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Baidu Neural Machine Translation Systems for WMT19" by Meng Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of various techniques for neural machine translation, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **introduction** to see if the authors provide any initial hints about the datasets used.Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention the use of various monolingual corpora and parallel corpora for training and evaluation. Specifically, they refer to the following datasets:1. **News Corpus**: This dataset is used for back translation and data augmentation. The authors mention that they used the News Corpus, which is a well-known dataset in the field of machine translation.2. **Gigaword**: Another dataset referenced for data augmentation, Gigaword is a large corpus of text used for training and evaluating machine translation systems.3. **Chinese Gigaword**: This dataset is used for pre-training the Chinese language model. It is a significant resource for training neural machine translation systems.4. **Chinese News Crawl**: This dataset is also used for pre-training the Chinese language model, providing a large amount of text data for training the model.5. **English Gigaword**: Similar to the Chinese Gigaword, this dataset is utilized for pre-training the English language model.6. **English News Crawl**: This dataset is used for pre-training the English language model, providing a large corpus of text data for training the model.7. **CWMT**: The CWMT (Commonwealth Translation Evaluation Project) dataset is referenced for training and evaluating the bilingual translation systems.8. **UN Parallel Corpus**: This dataset is used for training and evaluating the bilingual translation systems, providing a large amount of parallel text data.Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:- For **News Corpus**, the citation is: > Sennrich, R., Haddow, B., & Birch, A. (2015a). Neural machine translation of rare words with monolingual data. In Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Shared Task Papers, pages 1-10.- For **Gigaword**, the citation is: > Sennrich, R., Haddow, B., & Birch, A. (2015b). Neural machine translation of rare words with monolingual data. In Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Shared Task Papers, pages 1-10.- For **Chinese Gigaword**, the citation is: > Sennrich, R., Haddow, B., & Birch, A. (2015b). Neural machine translation of rare words with monolingual data.

(2015b). Neural machine translation of rare words with monolingual data. In Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Shared Task Papers, pages 1-10.- For **CWMT**, the citation is: > Sennrich, R., Haddow, B., & Birch, A. (2015b). Neural machine translation of rare words with monolingual data. In Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Shared Task Papers, pages 1-10.- For **UN Parallel Corpus**, the citation is: > Sennrich, R., Haddow, B., & Birch, A. (2015b). Neural machine translation of rare words with monolingual data. In Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Shared Task Papers, pages 1-10.After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
