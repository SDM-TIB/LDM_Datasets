To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PoWER-BERT: Accelerating BERT Inference via Progressive Word-vector Elimination" by Saurabh Goyal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of the PoWER-BERT method and mentions experiments on the GLUE benchmark, which suggests that datasets are involved.Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on a wide spectrum of classification/regression tasks from the **GLUE benchmark**. This indicates that the GLUE benchmark is a key dataset for their experiments.I will also check the **datasets table** (Table 1) provided in the paper, which lists the datasets used for evaluation, including their task types and statistics. The datasets mentioned are:1. **GLUE**: A multi-task benchmark for natural language understanding.2. **SST-2**: A sentiment classification dataset.3. **MNLI**: A natural language inference dataset.4. **MNLI-M**: A multi-task dataset for natural language inference.5. **MNLI-MM**: A multi-task dataset for natural language inference.6. **QNLI**: A question-answering dataset.7. **QQP**: A question-answering dataset.8. **MRPC**: A multi-task dataset for natural language inference.9. **STS-B**: A sentence similarity dataset.10. **IMDB**: A sentiment analysis dataset.11. **RACE**: A reading comprehension dataset.Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:- For **GLUE**, the citation is: > Alex Wang, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel R. Bowman. *GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding*. In ICLR, 2019.- For **SST-2**, the citation is: > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.05250, 2016.- For **MNLI**, the citation is: > Alex Wang, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel R. Bowman. *GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding*. In ICLR, 2019.- For **MNLI-M**, the citation is: > Alex Wang, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel R. Bowman. *GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding*.

Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In ACL, 2011.- For **RACE**, the citation is: > Guokun Lai, Qizhe Xie, Hanxiao Liu, Yiming Yang, and Eduard Hovy. *RACE: A benchmark and analysis platform for reading comprehension*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.04683, 2017.After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
