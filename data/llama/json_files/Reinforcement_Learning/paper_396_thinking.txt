To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator" by Alexey Dosovitskiy, German Ros, Felipe Codevilla, Antonio López, and Vladlen Koltun, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the development and evaluation of autonomous driving systems, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing simulation platforms and the need for open-source and customizable urban driving simulators. They hint at the use of digital assets and open-source code.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CARLA dataset**: A large dataset of urban environments, including urban layouts, buildings, vehicles, pedestrians, and street signs.
2. **Urban layouts**: A dataset of urban layouts, including roads, sidewalks, and buildings.
3. **Vehicle models**: A dataset of vehicle models, including cars and trucks.
4. **Pedestrian models**: A dataset of pedestrian models, including walking and running pedestrians.
5. **Street signs**: A dataset of street signs, including traffic lights, stop signs, and yield signs.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the autonomous driving systems.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CARLA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dosovitskiy, A., Ros, G., Codevilla, F., López, A., & Koltun, V. (2017). CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.04612.

- For **Urban layouts**, the citation is:
  > Not mentioned.

- For **Vehicle models**, the citation is:
  > Not mentioned.

- For **Pedestrian models**, the citation is:
  > Not mentioned.

- For **Street signs**, the citation is:
  > Not mentioned.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
