To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Faster Deep Q-learning using Neural Episodic Control" by Daichi Nishio and Satoshi Yamane, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of deep reinforcement learning and the importance of efficient sampling from experience replay. They hint at the evaluation of different algorithms on various tasks, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Pong**: A classic Atari game.
2. **Replay Buffer**: A buffer used to store experiences for reinforcement learning.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their proposed algorithm, NEC2DQN.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Pong**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Replay Buffer**, the citation is:
  > Not found

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
