To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advances in Experience Replay" by Hima Tammineedi, Tracy Wan, and Neil Xu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of experience replay techniques on various OpenAI gym environments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of experience replay in reinforcement learning and mention the use of OpenAI gym environments.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CartPole-v0**: A classic control problem where the goal is to balance a pole on top of a cart.
2. **MountainCar-v0**: A one dimensional track between two mountains where the goal is to drive up the mountain to the right.
3. **LunarLander-v2**: A two dimensional environment featuring a landing pad at (x,y)=(0,0) where the goal is to move from the top of the screen to the landing pad without crashing.
4. **Pendulum-v0**: A two dimensional environment featuring a frictionless pendulum where the goal is to keep the pendulum standing.
5. **Acrobot-v1**: A multi-joint robot arm control problem where the goal is to move the arm from a random initial position to a target position.
6. **Continuous Lunar Lander**: A two dimensional environment featuring a landing pad at (x,y)=(0,0) where the goal is to move from the top of the screen to the landing pad without crashing, with continuous action space.
7. **Continuous Mountain Car**: A one dimensional track between two mountains where the goal is to drive up the mountain to the right, with continuous action space.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of experience replay techniques.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CartPole-v0**, the citation is:
  > Not specified

- For **MountainCar-v0**, the citation is:
  > Not specified

- For **LunarLander-v2**, the citation is:
  > Not specified

- For **Pendulum-v0**, the citation is:
  > Not specified

- For **Acrobot-v1**, the citation is:
  > Not specified

- For **Continuous Lunar Lander**, the citation is:
  > Not specified

- For **Continuous Mountain Car**, the citation is:
  > Not specified

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
