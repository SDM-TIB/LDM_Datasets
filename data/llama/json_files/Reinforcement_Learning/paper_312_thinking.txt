To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving NP-Hard Problems on Graphs with Extended AlphaGo Zero" by Kenshin Abe, Zijian Xu, Issei Sato, Masashi Sugiyama, and others, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of reinforcement learning frameworks for NP-hard problems on graphs, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of solving combinatorial optimization problems on graphs and the potential of machine learning approaches. They mention the use of reinforcement learning and graph neural networks, but do not specify any particular datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Erdős-Rényi (ER) graphs**: These are random graphs with a specified number of nodes and edge probability.
2. **Barabási-Albert (BA) graphs**: These are scale-free graphs with a specified number of nodes and edge probability.
3. **Watts-Strogatz (WS) graphs**: These are small-world graphs with a specified number of nodes and edge probability.
4. **Sparse regular graphs**: These are graphs with a specified number of nodes and edge probability, where all nodes have the same degree.
5. **Citation networks**: These are networks of citations between papers.
6. **Web graphs**: These are networks of web pages linked to each other.
7. **Bio graphs**: These are networks of biological entities such as genes, proteins, and metabolites.
8. **Road map graphs**: These are networks of roads and intersections.
9. **DIMACS instances**: These are instances of NP-hard problems on graphs.
10. **JNLPBA corpus**: This is a corpus of annotated text data for named entity recognition.
11. **CHEMDNER corpus**: This is a corpus of annotated text data for chemical entities.
12. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: This is a corpus of annotated text data for gene mention recognition.
13. **Network Repository**: This is a repository of various networks, including citation networks, web graphs, bio graphs, and road map graphs.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
