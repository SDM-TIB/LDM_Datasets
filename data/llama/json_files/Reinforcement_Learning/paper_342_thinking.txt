To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PARAMETER SPACE NOISE FOR EXPLORATION" by Matthias Plappert et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of DQN, DDPG, and TRPO on high-dimensional discrete action environments and continuous control tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional RL methods and the importance of exploration, which hints at the use of datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: A benchmark for discrete action environments.
2. **OpenAI Gym**: A collection of continuous control environments.
3. **rllab**: A library for reinforcement learning, including sparse reward environments.
4. **Chain environment**: A simple environment for testing exploratory behavior.
5. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: A dataset for gene recognition tasks.
6. **JNLPBA corpus**: A corpus annotating proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
7. **CHEMDNER corpus**: A dataset focused on annotating drugs and chemicals.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ALE**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare et al. (2013)
- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman et al. (2016)
- For **rllab**, the citation is:
  > Duan et al. (2016)
- For **Chain environment**, the citation is:
  > Osband et al. (2016a)
- For **BC2GM**, the citation is:
  > Smith et al. (2008)
- For **JNLPBA**, the citation is:
  > Kim et al. (2004)
- For **CHEMDNER**, the citation is:
  > Krallinger et al. (2015)
