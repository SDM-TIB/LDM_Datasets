To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decoupling Exploration and Exploitation in Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms" by CA edric Colas, Olivier Sigaud, and Pierre-Yves Oudeyer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of two benchmarks: Continuous Mountain Car (CMC) and Half-Cheetah (HC) environments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of standard deep reinforcement learning algorithms like DDPG and the importance of exploration in continuous action domains.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two benchmarks:

1. **Continuous Mountain Car (CMC)**: A small size (2D state, 1D action) control benchmark with interesting deceptive reward properties.
2. **Half-Cheetah (HC)**: A larger (17D state, 6D action) benchmark where DDPG was recently the state-of-the-art.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CMC**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, Greg, Cheung, Vicki, Pettersson, Ludwig, Schneier, Jonas, Schulman, John, Tang, Jie, and Zaremba, Wojciech. Openai gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

- For **HC**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, Greg, Cheung, Vicki, Pettersson, Ludwig, Schneier, Jonas, Schulman, John, Tang, Jie, and Zaremba, Wojciech. Openai gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
