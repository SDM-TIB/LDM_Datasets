To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SUPERVISED POLICY UPDATE FOR DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING" by Quan Vuong, Yiming Zhang, and Keith Ross, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of policy gradient methods and the importance of sample eficiency in deep reinforcement learning. They hint at the evaluation of different algorithms on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Mujoco**: A physics engine for model-based control.
2. **Atari**: A collection of classic arcade games.
3. **OpenAI Gym**: A platform for general agents to learn from raw pixels and rewards.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their SPU algorithm, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Mujoco**, the citation is:
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control*. 2012. URL https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6386109/authors.

- For **Atari**, the citation is:
  > Volodymyr Mnih, Koray Kavukcuoglu, David Silver, Andrei A. Rusu, Joel Veness, Marc G. Belle-mare, Alex Graves, Martin Riedmiller, Andreas K. Fidjeland, Georg Ostrovski, Stig Petersen, Charles Beattie, Amir Sadik, Ioannis Antonoglou, Helen King, Dharshan Kumaran, Daan Wierstra, Shane Legg, and Demis Hassabis. *Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning*. Nature, 518, 2015. URL http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature14236.

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *Openai gym*. CoRR, abs/1606.01540, 2016. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
