To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vulnerability of Deep Reinforcement Learning to Policy Induction Attacks" by Vahid Behzadan and Arslan Munir, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the application of DQN in critical systems, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the applications of RL techniques and the limitations of hand-crafted representations of sensory input, which hints at the use of datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Atari 2600 game dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the DQN model.
2. **Pong game dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the DQN model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Atari 2600 game dataset**, the citation is:
  > V. Mnih, K. Kavukcuoglu, D. Silver, A. Graves, I. Antonoglou, D. Wierstra, and M. Riedmiller, *Playing atari with deep reinforcement learning*, arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.5602, 2013.

- For **Pong game dataset**, the citation is:
  > V. Mnih, K. Kavukcuoglu, D. Silver, A. A. Rusu, J. Veness, M. G. Bellemare, A. Graves, M. Riedmiller, A. K. Fidjeland, G. Ostrovski, et al., *Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning*, Nature, vol. 518, no. 7540, pp. 529-533, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
