    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAMPLE EFFICIENT ACTOR-CRITIC WITH EXPERIENCE REPLAY" by Ziyu Wang, Victor Bapst, Nicolas Heess, Volodymyr Mnih, Remi Munos, Koray Kavukcuoglu, and Nando de Freitas, I will follow a systematic approach.

    First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the Atari domain, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

    In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of deep Q-learning and the importance of sample efficiency, which hints at the use of datasets for evaluation.

    Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

    1. **Atari 57 games**: A dataset of 57 Atari games used for evaluation of the actor-critic method.
    2. **Cartpole**: A classic control problem used for evaluation of the actor-critic method.
    3. **Walker2D**: A 9-DoF planar walker used for evaluation of the actor-critic method.
    4. **Humanoid**: A 27-DoF humanoid robot used for evaluation of the actor-critic method.
    5. **Reacher3**: A 3-DoF planar robotic arm used for evaluation of the actor-critic method.
    6. **Cheetah**: A 9-DoF cheetah-like body used for evaluation of the actor-critic method.
    7. **Fish**: A 13-DoF ish-like body used for evaluation of the actor-critic method.

    In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their method, which reinforces their relevance.

    Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

    - For **Atari 57 games**, the citation is:
      > Brockman et al. (2016) presents a large collection of Atari games.

    - For **Cartpole**, the citation is:
      > Sutton et al. (2000) presents a classic control problem.

    - For **Walker2D**, the citation is:
      > Schulman et al. (2015a) presents a 9-DoF planar walker.

    - For **Humanoid**, the citation is:
      > Todorov et al. (2012) presents a 27-DoF humanoid robot.

    - For **Reacher3**, the citation is:
      > WawrzyA nski (2009) presents a 3-DoF planar robotic arm.

    - For **Cheetah**, the citation is:
      > Heess et al. (2015) presents a 9-DoF cheetah-like body.

    - For **Fish**, the citation is:
      > Levine et al. (2015) presents a 13-DoF ish-like body.

    After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
