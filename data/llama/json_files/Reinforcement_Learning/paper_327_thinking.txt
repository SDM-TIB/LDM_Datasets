To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Semantic Alignment for Improved Image Captions" by Pierre Dognina, Igor Melnyka, Youssef Mroueh, Jerret Ross, and Tom Sercua, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of models for image captioning, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional image captioning models and the importance of semantic alignment between images and captions. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset**: A large-scale dataset for image captioning.
2. **MS-COCO (Microsoft COCO) dataset**: A subset of the COCO dataset.
3. **SBU (Stanford University) dataset**: A dataset for image captioning.
4. **OOC (Out of Context) dataset**: A diagnostic dataset for evaluating the generalization of image captioning models.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T. Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S. J., Bourdev, L. D., Girshick, R. B., Hays, J.,... & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft COCO: common objects in context. European Conference on Computer Vision.
- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T. Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S. J., Bourdev, L. D., Girshick, R. B., Hays, J.,... & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft COCO: common objects in context. European Conference on Computer Vision.
- For **SBU**, the citation is:
  > Ordonez, V., Kulkarni, G., & Berg, T. L. (2011). Im2text: Describing images using 1 million captioned photographs. NIPS.
- For **OOC**, the citation is:
  > Jinchoi, M., Torralba, A., & Willsky, A. S. (2012). Context models and out-of-context objects. NIPS.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
