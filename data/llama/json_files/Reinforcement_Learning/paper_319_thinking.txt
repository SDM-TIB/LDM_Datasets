To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Prioritized Experience Replay" by Dan Horgan, John Quan, David Budden, Gabriel Barth-Maron, Matteo Hessel, Hado van Hasselt, David Silver, and Gabriel Barth-Maron, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of standard reinforcement learning algorithms and the importance of data generation and selection. They hint at the evaluation of different algorithms on various tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: A benchmark for reinforcement learning.
2. **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**: A reinforcement learning algorithm.
3. **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)**: A reinforcement learning algorithm.
4. **Atari games**: A set of classic arcade games.
5. **Continuous control tasks**: A set of tasks for continuous control, including:
	* Humanoid
	* Manipulator
	* Walking
	* Running
6. **MuJoCo physics simulator**: A simulator for continuous control tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their algorithms, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ALE**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare et al. (2013) - Arcade Learning Environment: An evaluation platform for general agents.

- For **DQN**, the citation is:
  > Mnih et al. (2015) - Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning.

- For **DDPG**, the citation is:
  > Lillicrap et al. (2016) - Continuous control with deep reinforcement learning.

- For **Atari games**, the citation is:
  > Mnih et al. (2015) - Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning.

- For **Continuous control tasks**, the citation is:
  > Tassa et al. (2018) - DeepMind Control Suite.

- For **MuJoCo physics simulator**, the citation is:
  > Todorov et al. (2012) - Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
