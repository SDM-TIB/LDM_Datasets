To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AlphaStar: An Evolutionary Computation Perspective" by Kai Arulkumaran, Antoine Cully, and Julian Togelius, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the AlphaStar system, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of various datasets for training and evaluation of the AlphaStar system, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named datasets:

1. **StarCraft II dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the AlphaStar system.
2. **Nash distribution dataset**: This dataset is used to represent the set of complementary, least exploitable strategies in the game of StarCraft II.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **StarCraft II dataset**, the citation is:
  > Oriol Vinyals, Igor Babuschkin, Junyoung Chung, Michael Mathieu, Max Jaderberg, et al. *AlphaStar: Mastering the Real-Time Strategy Game StarCraft II*. https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/

- For **Nash distribution dataset**, the citation is:
  > David Balduzzi, Karl Tuyls, Julien Perolat, and Thore Graepel. 2018. Re-evaluating evaluation. In NeurIPS.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
