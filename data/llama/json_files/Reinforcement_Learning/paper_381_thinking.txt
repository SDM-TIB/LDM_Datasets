To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Adversarial Tree Search for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, Brandon Yang, Weitang Liu, Zachary C. Lipton, and Animashree Anandkumar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of Atari games and the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) as testbeds, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the design of deep generative models for RL environments and propose a sample eficient and robust method to learn the model of Atari environments. They mention the use of Atari games in Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) as the testbed.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: This dataset is used for Atari games.
2. **OpenAI Gym**: This dataset is used for general agents.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ALE**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. J. Artif. Intell. Res.(JAIR).

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., and Zaremba, W. (2016). Openai gym.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
