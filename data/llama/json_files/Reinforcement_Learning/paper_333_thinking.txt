To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classifying Options for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Kai Arulkumaran, Nat Dilokthanakul, Murray Shanahan, and Anil Anthony Bharath, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of different datasets for reinforcement learning tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of various reinforcement learning algorithms, including deep Q-networks (DQN), and mention the need for datasets to evaluate these algorithms.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Catch**: A game of catch where the task can be broken down into reward-independent subtasks.
2. **Atari games**: A set of classic Atari games used for training and evaluation of reinforcement learning algorithms.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their proposed algorithm.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Catch**, the citation is:
  > Volodymyr Mnih, Nicolas Heess, AlexGraves, et al. Recurrent models of visual attention. In Ad-vances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages2204a2212, 2014.

- For **Atari games**, the citation is:
  > Not explicitly mentioned, but the authors mention the use of Atari games in the introduction.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
