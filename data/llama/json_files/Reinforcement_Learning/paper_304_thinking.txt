To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feedback Transformers" by Angela Fan, David Grangier, and Michael Auli, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the Feedback Transformer on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of the Transformer architecture and propose the Feedback Transformer as a solution. They mention that the Feedback Transformer can be used for language modeling, machine translation, and reinforcement learning tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Char-PTB**: A character-level language modeling dataset.
2. **Enwik8**: A character-level language modeling dataset.
3. **WikiText-103**: A text classification dataset.
4. **IWSLT De-En**: A machine translation dataset.
5. **WMT En-De**: A machine translation dataset.
6. **Corridor**: A reinforcement learning dataset.
7. **Copy and Reverse**: An algorithmic task dataset.
8. **Counting**: An algorithmic task dataset.
9. **Random Walk**: An algorithmic task dataset.
10. **Maze Navigation**: A reinforcement learning dataset.
11. **Water Maze**: A reinforcement learning dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of the Feedback Transformer, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
