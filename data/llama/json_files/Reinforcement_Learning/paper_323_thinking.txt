To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Exploration through Bayesian Deep Q-Networks" by Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, Animashree Anandkumar, we will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of exploration-exploitation trade-off in high-dimensional environments, which implies the use of datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Atari games**: A collection of classic arcade games, which are used for evaluation of the proposed Bayesian Deep Q-Network (BDQN) algorithm.
2. **OpenAIGym**: A platform for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms, which provides a set of pre-defined environments, including Atari games.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Atari games**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. J. Artif. Intell. Res.(JAIR).

- For **OpenAIGym**, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., and Zaremba, W. (2016). Openai gym.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
