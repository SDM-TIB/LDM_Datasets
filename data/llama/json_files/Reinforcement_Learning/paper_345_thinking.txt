To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MOVI: A Model-Free Approach to Dynamic Fleet Management" by Takuma Oda and Carlee Joe-Wong, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of dispatch policies, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of model-based approaches and the importance of model-free approaches for dynamic fleet management. They hint at the use of a large-scale realistic simulator based on 15.6 million taxi trip records.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission trip records**: This dataset is used for training and testing the MOVI simulator.
2. **Open Street Map road network data**: This dataset is used to construct a directed graph modeling the road network in the service area.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission trip records**, the citation is:
  > New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip-record-data.shtml

- For **Open Street Map road network data**, the citation is:
  > OpenStreetMap https://www.openstreetmap.org

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
