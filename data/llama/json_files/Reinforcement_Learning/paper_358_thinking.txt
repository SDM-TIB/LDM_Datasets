To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimized Computation OfioadingPerformance in Virtual Edge ComputingSystems via Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Xianfu Chen, Honggang Zhang, Celimuge Wu, Shiwen Mao, Yusheng Ji, and Mehdi Bennis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization of computation ofioading performance in virtual edge computing systems, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional computation ofioading policies and the importance of using deep reinforcement learning for optimization. They hint at the use of datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Task queue state**: The authors mention that the task queue state is a key factor in computation ofioading performance.
2. **Energy queue state**: The authors mention that the energy queue state is also a key factor in computation ofioading performance.
3. **Channel qualities**: The authors mention that the channel qualities between the MU and the BSs are a key factor in computation ofioading performance.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their proposed deep reinforcement learning algorithm.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Task queue state**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Energy queue state**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Channel qualities**, the citation is:
  > Not found

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
