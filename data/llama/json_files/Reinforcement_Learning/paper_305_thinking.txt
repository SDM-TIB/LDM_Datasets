To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer-based Acoustic Modeling for Hybrid Speech Recognition" by Yongqiang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the Librispeech benchmark and the internal dataset used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and the potential of transformer-based models for hybrid speech recognition.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Librispeech**: A widely used benchmark for speech recognition.
2. **Internal dataset**: A larger dataset used for evaluation, but its name is not specified.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Librispeech**, the citation is:
  > Panayotov, V., Chen, G., Povey, D., & Khudanpur, S. (2015). Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books. In Proceedings of Interspeech (pp. 5206-5210).

- For the **internal dataset**, the citation is:
  > The authors mention that they used their own internal dataset, but do not provide a specific citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
