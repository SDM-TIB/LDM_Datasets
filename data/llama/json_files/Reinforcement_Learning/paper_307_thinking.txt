To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving QSAT problems with neural MCTSRuiyang Xu and Karl Lieberherr" I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the QSAT problem and the use of neural MCTS algorithm, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the QSAT problem and its relation to QSAT games. They mention that QSAT problems can be encoded as graphs and that a graph neural network (GNN) can be used to embed the QSAT problems into the neural MCTS framework.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **QSAT problems**: The authors mention that QSAT problems can be encoded as graphs and that a graph neural network (GNN) can be used to embed the QSAT problems into the neural MCTS framework.
2. **QSAT games**: The authors mention that QSAT games can be used to evaluate the performance of the neural MCTS algorithm.
3. **QSAT graphs**: The authors mention that QSAT graphs can be used to encode QSAT problems and that a GNN can be used to embed these graphs into the neural MCTS framework.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **QSAT problems**, there is no specific citation mentioned in the paper.
- For **QSAT games**, there is no specific citation mentioned in the paper.
- For **QSAT graphs**, there is no specific citation mentioned in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
