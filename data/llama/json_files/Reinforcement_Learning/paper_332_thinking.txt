To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Matteo Hessel et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the Rainbow algorithm on the Atari 2600 benchmark, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the improvements to the DQN algorithm and the need for a comprehensive evaluation of the combined algorithm. They hint at the use of various datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Atari 2600 benchmark**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the Rainbow algorithm.
2. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the Rainbow algorithm.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the Rainbow algorithm.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Atari 2600 benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare et al. (2013) The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents.

- For **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare et al. (2013) The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
