To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning based QoS/QoE-aware Service Function Chaining in Software-Driven 5G Slices" by Xi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the 5G domain, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of SDN and NFV and the importance of QoS/QoE-aware service function chaining. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **LLDP**: A protocol used for topology discovery in SDN networks.
2. **QoS over LLDP**: A scheme for collecting QoS information alongside topology discovery.
3. **Floodlight controller and OVS**: Software-defined networking platforms used for testing the QoS over LLDP scheme.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LLDP**, the citation is:
  > Cisco. LLDP-MED and Cisco Discovery Protocol. CiscoWhite Papers. 2006;:1a12.

- For **QoS over LLDP**, the citation is:
  > Xi Chen et al. QoS over LLDP Scheme for Software-Driven 5G Slices. IEEE Communications Magazine. 2019;57(10):142a149.

- For **Floodlight controller and OVS**, the citation is:
  > Pfai Ben, Pettit Justin, Koponen Teemu, et al. The design and implementation of open vSwitch. In: 12th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI), vol. 40: :117a130; 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
