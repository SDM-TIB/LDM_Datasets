To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COUNTERFACTUAL EXPLANATIONS WITHOUT OPENING THE BLACK BOX: AUTOMATED DECISIONS AND THE GDPR" by Sandra Wachter, Brent Mittelstadt, and Chris Russell, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the LSAT dataset and the Pima Diabetes Database.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the existence of a right to explanation in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its merits and disadvantages. They also mention the LSAT dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **LSAT dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting students' first-year average grade on the basis of their race, grade-point average prior to law school, and law school entrance exam scores.
2. **Pima Diabetes Database**: This dataset is used for predicting whether women of Pima heritage are at risk of diabetes.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LSAT dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Darrell Bock & Marcus Lieberman, Fitting a Response Model for n Dichotomously Scored Items, 35 PSYCHOMETRIKA 179, 187a96 (1970).

- For **Pima Diabetes Database**, the citation is:
  > Jack W. Smith et al., Using the ADAP Learning Algorithm to Forecast the Onset of Diabetes Mellitus, PROC. ANN. SYMP. ON COMPUT. APPLICATION MED. CARE 261, 261a62 (1988).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
