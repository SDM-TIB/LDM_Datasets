To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Run with Actor-Critic Ensemble" by Zhewei Huang, Shuchang Zhou, BoEr Zhuang, and Xinyu Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the competition of Learning to Run and the use of a critic network to select actions.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the problem of dooming actions in the Learning to Run competition and the need for a method to avoid these actions.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Learning to Run competition dataset**: This dataset is used for the Learning to Run competition.
2. **Replay buffer**: This dataset is used for storing experiences and selecting actions.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their method.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Learning to Run competition dataset**, the citation is:
  > https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/nips-2017-learning-to-run/leaderboards

- For **Replay buffer**, the citation is:
  > Not mentioned

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
