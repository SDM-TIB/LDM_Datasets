    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "THE REACTOR:A FAST AND SAMPLE-EFFICIENT ACTOR-CRITICAGENT FOR REINFORCEMENT LEARNING" by Audrunas Gruslys, Will Dabney, Mohammad Gheshlaghi Azar, Bilal Piot, Marc G. Bellemare, and RAmi Munos, I will follow a systematic approach.

    First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

    In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing reinforcement learning algorithms and the importance of sample- and time-eficient agents. They hint at the evaluation of these agents on various Atari games.

    Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following Atari games:

    1. **Atari 2600 benchmarks**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the proposed Reactor agent.
    2. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the proposed Reactor agent.

    In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

    Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

    - For **Atari 2600 benchmarks**, the citation is:
      > Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. J. Artif. Intell. Res.(JAIR), 47:253a279, 2013.

    - For **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, the citation is:
      > Marc G Bellemare, Will Dabney, and RAmi Munos. A distributional perspective on reinforcement learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.06887, 2017.

    After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
