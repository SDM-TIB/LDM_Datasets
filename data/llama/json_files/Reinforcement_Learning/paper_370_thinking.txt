To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Episodic Backward Update" by Su Young Lee, Sungik Choi, and Sae-Young Chung, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of deep reinforcement learning algorithms and the importance of sample efficiency. They hint at the evaluation of these algorithms on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **2D MNIST Maze Environment**: This dataset is used for maze navigation tasks.
2. **49 Games of Atari 2600 Domain**: This dataset is used for Atari game playing tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their algorithms, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **2D MNIST Maze Environment**, the citation is:
  > The authors mention the use of the MNIST dataset for state representation.

- For **49 Games of Atari 2600 Domain**, the citation is:
  > The authors mention the use of the Arcade Learning Environment for Atari game playing tasks.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
