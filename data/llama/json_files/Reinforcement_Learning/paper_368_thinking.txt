To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GL.sc[3v81130.2071:viXraSigmoid-Weighted Linear Units for Neural Network FunctionApproximation in Reinforcement Learning" by Stefan Elfwinga, Eiji Uchibe, and Kenji Doya, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of stochastic SZ-Tetris and Tetris with a small 10A10 board, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of neural networks for function approximation in reinforcement learning and mention the Atari 2600 domain.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SZ-Tetris**: A simplified but difficult version of Tetris.
2. **Tetris**: A classic puzzle game.
3. **Atari 2600 games**: A collection of games for the Atari 2600 console.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SZ-Tetris**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.
- For **Tetris**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.
- For **Atari 2600 games**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
