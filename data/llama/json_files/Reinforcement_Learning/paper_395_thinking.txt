To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging the Gap Between Value and Policy Based Reinforcement Learning" by Oir Nachum, Mohammad Norouzi, and Dale Schuurmans, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of value and policy based reinforcement learning and the importance of combining these approaches. They hint at the evaluation of these methods on various tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Synthetic Tree**: A simple synthetic environment.
2. **Copy**: A task where the agent must copy a sequence of characters.
3. **DuplicatedInput**: A task where the agent must deduplicate a sequence of characters.
4. **RepeatCopy**: A task where the agent must copy a sequence of characters, then reverse it, and finally forward it again.
5. **Reverse**: A task where the agent must copy a sequence of characters in reverse order.
6. **ReversedAddition**: A task where the agent must observe two ternary numbers in little-endian order via a 2 A n grid and output their sum.
7. **ReversedAddition3**: A task where the agent must observe three ternary numbers in little-endian order via a 3 A n grid and output their sum.
8. **Hard ReversedAddition**: A task where the agent must observe two ternary numbers in little-endian order via a 2 A n grid and output their sum, without using curriculum.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the proposed algorithms.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Synthetic Tree**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Copy**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **DuplicatedInput**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **RepeatCopy**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Reverse**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **ReversedAddition**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **ReversedAddition3**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Hard ReversedAddition**, the citation is:
  > Not found

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
