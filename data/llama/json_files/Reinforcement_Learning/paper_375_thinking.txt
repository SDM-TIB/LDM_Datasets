To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kronecker-factored approximation of the natural gradient" by J. Ba, R. Grosse, and J. Martens, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The introduction mentions the Kronecker-factored approximation to the natural gradient, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **methods section**, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **OpenAI Gym**: A platform for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.
2. **MuJoCo**: A physics engine for model-based control.
3. **Atari games**: A set of classic arcade games.
4. **Image observations**: A set of images used as input to the model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their method.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **OpenAI Gym**, the citation is:
  > G. Brockman, V. Cheung, L. Pettersson, J. Schneider, J. Schulman, J. Tang, and W. Zaremba. OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

- For **MuJoCo**, the citation is:
  > E. Todorov, T. Erez, and Y. Tassa. MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control. IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2012.

- For **Atari games**, the citation is:
  > M. G. Bellemare, Y. Naddaf, J. Veness, and M. Bowling. The arcade learning environment: A benchmark for general agents. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253–279, 2013.

- For **Image observations**, the citation is:
  > D. Silver, A. Huang, C. J. Maddison, A. Guez, L. Sifre, G. Van Den Driessche, J. Schrittwieser, I. Antonoglou, V. Panneershelvam, M. Lanctot, S. Dieleman, D. Grewe, J. Nham, N. Kalchbrenner, I. Sutskever, T. Lillicrap, M. Leach, K. Kavukcuoglu, T. Graepel, and D. Hassabis. Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search. Nature, 529(7587):484–489, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
