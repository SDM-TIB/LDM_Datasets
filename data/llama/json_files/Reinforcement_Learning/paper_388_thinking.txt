To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pretraining Deep Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning AlgorithmsWith Expert Demonstrations" by Xiaoqin Zhang, Huimin Ma, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of reinforcement learning algorithms and the importance of expert demonstrations. They hint at the evaluation of these algorithms on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **MuJoCo physics engine**: This dataset is used for continuous control problems.
2. **Atari games**: This dataset is used for discrete control problems.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their algorithms, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MuJoCo physics engine**, the citation is:
  > Todorov et al. (2012) Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control.

- For **Atari games**, the citation is:
  > Silver et al. (2016) Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
