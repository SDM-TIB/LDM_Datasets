To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LEARNING TO SEARCH FOR FAST MAXIMUM COMMON SUBGRAPH DETECTION" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of models for the Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) detection task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of state-of-the-art MCS solvers and the importance of learning to search for MCS detection. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **NCI109**: A collection of small-sized chemical compounds.
2. **ROAD**: A road network of California.
3. **DBEN**: A dataset originally used in a work on cross-lingual entity alignment.
4. **DBZH**: A dataset originally used in a work on cross-lingual entity alignment.
5. **DBPD**: A dataset originally used in a work on cross-lingual entity alignment.
6. **ENRO**: An email communication network.
7. **COPR**: An Amazon computer product network.
8. **CIRC**: A graph pair where each graph is a circuit diagram.
9. **HPPI**: A human protein-protein interaction network.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **NCI109**, the citation is:
  > Wale et al. (2008)

- For **ROAD**, the citation is:
  > Leskovec et al. (2009)

- For **DBEN**, the citation is:
  > Sun et al. (2017)

- For **DBZH**, the citation is:
  > Sun et al. (2017)

- For **DBPD**, the citation is:
  > Sun et al. (2017)

- For **ENRO**, the citation is:
  > Klimt & Yang (2004)

- For **COPR**, the citation is:
  > Shchur et al. (2018)

- For **CIRC**, the citation is:
  > Not mentioned

- For **HPPI**, the citation is:
  > Agrawal et al. (2018)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
