To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IMPALA: Scalable Distributed Deep-RL with Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architectures" by Lasse Espeholt et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of DMLab-30 and Atari-57 datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of training a single agent on many tasks at once and introduce the IMPALA algorithm.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **DMLab-30**: A set of 30 diverse cognitive tasks in the 3D DeepMind Lab environment.
2. **Atari-57**: A set of 57 Atari games in the Arcade Learning Environment.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DMLab-30**, the citation is:
  > Beattie et al., 2016

- For **Atari-57**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare et al., 2013a

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
