    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural Gradient Deep Q-Learning" by Ethan Knight, I will follow a systematic approach.

    First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the comparison of original deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm to its natural-gradient counterpart, NGDQN, on a collection of classic control domains.

    In the **methods section**, the authors mention the following datasets:

    1. **CartPole-v0**: A classic control task where the agent balances a pole on a controllable sliding cart on a friction-less rail for 200 timesteps.
    2. **CartPole-v1**: A more challenging environment where the agent balances a pole on a cart for 500 timesteps rather than 200.
    3. **Acrobot-v1**: An environment where the agent is given rewards for swinging a double-jointed pendulum up from a stationary position.
    4. **LunarLander-v2**: An environment where the agent attempts to land a lander on a particular location on a simulated 2D world.

    In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and evaluation of NGDQN.

    Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

    - For **CartPole-v0**, the citation is:
      > Brockman et al. (2016) OpenAI Gym <https://gym.openai.com/>

    - For **CartPole-v1**, the citation is:
      > Brockman et al. (2016) OpenAI Gym <https://gym.openai.com/>

    - For **Acrobot-v1**, the citation is:
      > Brockman et al. (2016) OpenAI Gym <https://gym.openai.com/>

    - For **LunarLander-v2**, the citation is:
      > Brockman et al. (2016) OpenAI Gym <https://gym.openai.com/>

    After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
