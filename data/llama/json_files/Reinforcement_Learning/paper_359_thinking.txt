To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting Noise Robustness of Acoustic Model via Deep Adversarial Training" by Bin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the CHiME-4 corpus and the WSJ0 set, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional speech enhancement approaches and the importance of boosting noise robustness of acoustic models. They hint at the evaluation of their proposed method on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CHiME-4 corpus**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method.
2. **WSJ0 set**: This dataset is used for training the acoustic model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CHiME-4 corpus**, the citation is:
  > Vincent, E., Watanabe, S., Nugraha, A. A., Barker, J., & Marxer, R. (2016). An analysis of environment, microphone, and data simulation mismatches in robust speech recognition. Computer Speech and Language, 36, 247–262. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csl.2016.04.002

- For **WSJ0 set**, the citation is:
  > Paul, D. B., & Baker, J. R. (1992). The design and implementation of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus. Proceedings of the 31st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 75–78.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
