To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Episodic Memory Deep Q-Networks" by Zichuan Lin, Tianqi Zhao, Guangwen Yang, and Lintao Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of deep reinforcement learning algorithms and the importance of episodic memory-based approaches. They hint at the evaluation of these methods on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: A dataset of 57 Atari 2600 games.
2. **Episodic Control (EC)**: A dataset used for evaluation of episodic control methods.
3. **Dueling Networks (DQN)**: A dataset used for evaluation of dueling networks.
4. **Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)**: A dataset used for evaluation of prioritized experience replay.
5. **Double-DQN (DDQN)**: A dataset used for evaluation of double-DQN.
6. **Monte-Carlo Deep Q-Networks (MCDQN)**: A dataset used for evaluation of MCDQN.
7. **Episodic Memory Deep Q-Networks (EMDQN)**: The proposed dataset used for evaluation of EMDQN.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their method, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ALE**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare et al. (2013) Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents.

- For **EC**, the citation is:
  > Blundell et al. (2016) Model-free episodic control.

- For **DQN**, the citation is:
  > Mnih et al. (2015) Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning.

- For **PER**, the citation is:
  > Schaul et al. (2016) Prioritized experience replay.

- For **DDQN**, the citation is:
  > Van Hasselt et al. (2016) Double Q-learning.

- For **MCDQN**, the citation is:
  > Wang et al. (2016) Dueling network architectures for deep reinforcement learning.

- For **EMDQN**, the citation is:
  > This paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
