To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Genetic Algorithms Are a Competitive Alternative for Training Deep Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning" by Felipe Petroski, Such Vashisht Madhavan, Edoardo Conti, Joel Lehman, Kenneth O. Stanley, Jeff Clune, and Uber AI Labs, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the training of deep neural networks for reinforcement learning tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning algorithms and the potential of genetic algorithms for deep neural networks. They hint at the evaluation of these algorithms on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Atari games**: A set of 13 Atari games used for evaluation.
2. **Image Hard Maze**: A new version of the Image Hard Maze domain, which is a deceptive Atari-scale game.
3. **Humanoid Locomotion**: A challenging continuous control benchmark for humanoid locomotion.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the genetic algorithm.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Atari games**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare M. G., Naddaf Y., Veness J., and Bowling M. The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. J. Artif. Intell. Res. (JAIR), 2013.

- For **Image Hard Maze**, the citation is:
  > Lehman J. and Stanley K. O. Abandoning objectives: Evolution through the search for novelty alone. Evolutionary Computation, 2011a.

- For **Humanoid Locomotion**, the citation is:
  > Brockman G., Cheung V., Pettersson L., Schneider J., Schulman J., Tang J., and Zaremba W. OpenAI gym, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
