To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implementing the Deep Q-Network" by Melrose Roderick, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the implementation of the Deep Q-Network and the use of the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) for training.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of replicating results for complex systems and the limitations of the original Deep Q-Network paper.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: A framework for interacting with Atari games.
2. **Atari 2600 video games**: A collection of classic video games used for training and evaluation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and evaluation of the Deep Q-Network.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ALE**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47, 253-279.

- For **Atari 2600 video games**, the citation is:
  > Mnih, V., Kavukcuoglu, K., Silver, D., Rusu, A. A., Veness, J., Antonoglou, I.,... & Hassabis, D. (2015). Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning. Nature, 518(7540), 529-533.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
