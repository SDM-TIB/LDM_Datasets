To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Addressing Function Approximation Error in Actor-Critic Methods" by Scott Fujimoto, Herke van Hoof, and David Meger, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of OpenAI gym tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of value-based reinforcement learning methods and the importance of addressing function approximation errors. They hint at the use of various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the use of OpenAI gym tasks, but no specific datasets are mentioned.

In the **results section**, the authors evaluate their method on the suite of OpenAI gym tasks, which suggests that these tasks are the datasets being used.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For OpenAI gym tasks, the citation is:
  > Brockman et al. (2016) OpenAI Gym, https://gym.openai.com/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
