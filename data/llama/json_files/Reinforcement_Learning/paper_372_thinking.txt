To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sample efficient deep reinforcement learning for dialogue systems with large action spaces" by Gellert Weisz, PaweA Budzianowski, Student Member, IEEE, Pei-Hao Su, Student Member, IEEE, and Milica GaEsiA c, Member, IEEE, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms for dialogue systems, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of policy optimization in dialogue systems with large action spaces. They hint at the evaluation of different algorithms on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the Cambridge Restaurants domain and the CamInfo domain.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the Cambridge Restaurants domain, the dataset is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For the CamInfo domain, the authors mention the following datasets:
  > The CamInfo dataset is a multi-domain dialogue system dataset that includes 4 A 28 = 1024 informactions and 3A3+2 = 11 other actions, making up 1035 actions in total.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
