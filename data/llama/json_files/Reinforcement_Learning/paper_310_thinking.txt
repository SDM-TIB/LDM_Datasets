To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable Attention based GraphConvolutional Network for Disease prediction" by Anees Kazi, Soroush Farghadani, and Nassir Navab, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of two publicly available datasets, Tadpole and UKBB, for disease prediction tasks.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of interpretability in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and highlight the limitations of existing methods.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Tadpole**: A dataset used for Alzheimer's disease prediction.
2. **UKBB**: A dataset used for gender and age prediction tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Tadpole**, the citation is:
  > Marinescu, R., Oxtoby, N., Young, A., Bron, E., Toga, A., Weiner, M., Barkhof, F., Fox, N., Klein, S. *Tadpole challenge: Prediction of longitudinal evolution in Alzheimer's disease*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.03909 (2018)

- For **UKBB**, the citation is:
  > Miller, K.L., Alfaro-Almagro, F., Bangerter, N.K., Thomas, D.L., Yacoub, E., Xu, J., Bartsch, A.J., Jbabdi, S., Sotiropoulos, S.N., Andersson, J.L., et al. *Multimodal population brain imaging in the UK Biobank prospective epidemiological study*. Nature neuroscience 19(11), 1523 (2016)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
