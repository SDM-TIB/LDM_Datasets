To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Distributional DDPG" by Gabriel Barth-Maron et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various datasets for training and testing the D4PG algorithm.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of reinforcement learning for continuous control tasks and mention the MuJoCo physics simulator, which is used to simulate various robotic environments.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and testing. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MuJoCo physics simulator**: A collection of simulated robotic environments, including the Acrobot, Cartpole, Cheetah, Finger, Fish, Hopper, Humanoid, Manipulator, Pendulum, Reacher, Swimmer, and Walker.
2. **MuJoCo hand model**: A simulated hand model used for manipulation tasks.
3. **Parkour domains**: A set of tasks designed to test the D4PG algorithm's ability to learn dexterous manipulation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and testing the D4PG algorithm.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MuJoCo physics simulator**, the citation is:
  > Todorov et al. (2012) MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control.
  > Todorov et al. (2012) Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control.
- For **MuJoCo hand model**, the citation is:
  > Kumar & Todorov (2015) MuJoCo HAPTIX: A virtual reality system for hand manipulation.
- For **Parkour domains**, the citation is:
  > Heess et al. (2017) Emergence of locomotion behaviors in rich environments.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
