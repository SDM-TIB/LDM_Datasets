To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for MixedCooperative-Competitive Environments" by Ryan Lowea, McGill University, OpenAI, Yi Wua, UC Berkeley, Aviv Tamar, UC Berkeley, and Jean Harb, McGill University, OpenAI, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of multi-agent reinforcement learning methods for mixed cooperative-competitive environments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the difficulty of traditional algorithms in multi-agent domains and propose a new approach using actor-critic methods.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **ViXraMulti-Agent Actor-Critic dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the proposed multi-agent actor-critic algorithm.
2. **GL.sc dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the proposed algorithm.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ViXraMulti-Agent Actor-Critic dataset**, the citation is not found in the paper.
- For **GL.sc dataset**, the citation is not found in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
