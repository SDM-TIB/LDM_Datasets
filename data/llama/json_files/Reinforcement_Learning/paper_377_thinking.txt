To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Formulation of Deep Reinforcement Learning Architecture Toward Autonomous Driving for On-Ramp Merge" by Pin Wang and Ching-Yao Chan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the autonomous driving problem, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing models and the importance of incorporating long-term objectives and interactions with other vehicles. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **TORCS**: A racing simulator dataset used for training and testing autonomous driving models.
2. **Racer**: A browser-based car simulator dataset used for training and testing autonomous driving models.
3. **US Interstate Highway I-80**: A real-world dataset used for training and testing autonomous driving models.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **TORCS**, the citation is:
  > Sallab, A., Abdou, M., Perot, E., Yogamani, S. End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning for Lane Keeping Assist. 30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, Barcelona, Spain, 2016.

- For **Racer**, the citation is:
  > Sallab, A., Abdou, M., Perot, E., Yogamani, S. End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning for Lane Keeping Assist. 30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, Barcelona, Spain, 2016.

- For **US Interstate Highway I-80**, the citation is:
  > Shalev-Shwartz, S., Shammah, S., Shashua, A.. Safe, Multi-Agent, Driving. Autonomous Learning for Reinforcement arXiv:1610.03295v1.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
