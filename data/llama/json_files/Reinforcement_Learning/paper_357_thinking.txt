To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Policy Inference Q-Network for Multi-Agent Systems" by Zhang-Wei Honga, Shih-Yang Sua, Tzu-Yun Shanna, Yi-Hsiang Changa, Chun-Yi Lea, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the multi-agent domain, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous models and the importance of modeling agents with varying strategies. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Soccer game environment**: This dataset is used for training and testing the proposed models.
2. **Experience replay memory**: This dataset is used for training the models.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Soccer game environment**, the citation is:
  > Zhang-Wei Honga, Shih-Yang Sua, Tzu-Yun Shanna, Yi-Hsiang Changa, Chun-Yi Lea. *A Deep Policy Inference Q-Network for Multi-Agent Systems*. In Proc. of the 17th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2018), Stockholm, Sweden, July 10a15, 2018, IFAAMAS, 9 pages.

- For **Experience replay memory**, the citation is:
  > Same as above.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
