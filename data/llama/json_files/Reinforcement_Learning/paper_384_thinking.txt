    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Noisy Networks for Exploration" by Meire Fortunato, Mohammad Gheshlaghi Azar, Azara Bilal, Piot, Jacob Menick, Matteo Hessel, Ian Osband, Alex Graves, Volodymyr Mnih, and Remi Munos, I will follow a systematic approach.

    First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of reinforcement learning agents, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

    In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of exploration methods in reinforcement learning and the need for a more structured approach. They hint at the evaluation of different exploration methods on various Atari games.

    Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three Atari games:

    1. **Pong**: A classic Atari game.
    2. **Beam Rider**: A racing game.
    3. **Asteroids**: A space-themed shooter game.

    In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their NoisyNet agent.

    Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

    - For **Pong**, the citation is:
      > Bellemare et al. (2015) - Atari Games with Large Action Spaces
    - For **Beam Rider**, the citation is:
      > Bellemare et al. (2015) - Atari Games with Large Action Spaces
    - For **Asteroids**, the citation is:
      > Bellemare et al. (2015) - Atari Games with Large Action Spaces

    After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
