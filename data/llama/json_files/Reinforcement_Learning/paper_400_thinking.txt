To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Policy Gradient with Transformation" by Tianbing Xu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization of variational policy gradient with transformation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of variational inference to policy gradient methods, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **BC2GM**: This dataset is used for gene recognition tasks.
2. **JNLPBA**: This corpus annotates proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
3. **CHEMDNER**: This dataset is focused on annotating drugs and chemicals.
4. **Penn Action Dataset**: This dataset contains video clips with 13 joints annotated in all frames, including head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles.
5. **TRPO Variational Policy Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the TRPO variational policy gradient algorithm.
6. **PPO Variational Policy Dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the PPO variational policy gradient algorithm.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
