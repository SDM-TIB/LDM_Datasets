To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Crawling in Rogueas dungeonswith (partitioned) A3C" by Andrea Asperti, Daniele Cortesi, and Francesco Sovrano, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the application of A3C to the Rogue video game, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the complexity of the Rogue game and the need for reinforcement learning to solve it. They hint at the use of a partitioned A3C approach.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Rogue dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the A3C model.
2. **Rogue levels dataset**: This dataset is used to generate levels for the Rogue game.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and evaluation of the A3C model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Rogue dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Rogue levels dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not found

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
