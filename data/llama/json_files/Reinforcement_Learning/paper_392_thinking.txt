To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rapid Probabilistic Interest Learning from Domain-Specific Pairwise Image Comparisons" by Michael Burke, Siyabonga Mbonambi, Purity Molala, and Raesetje Sefala, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of pairwise image comparisons to reduce the labelling burden on end-users, and the introduction discusses the importance of domain-specific models of image interest.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of pairwise image comparisons to infer image interests using a Bayesian ranking approach over image features extracted using a pre-trained convolutional neural network.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **OASIS**: A small publically available medical imaging dataset of 416 averaged and co-registered T1-weighted cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging scans of patients with varying levels of dementia.
2. **Violence**: A publically available dataset of over 10,000 protest images with accompanying measures of the perceived violence depicted therein.
3. **Coastcam**: A dataset consisting of almost 2,000 outdoor images of the Fishhoek coastline in South Africa, captured from a static camera.
4. **Place Pulse 2.0**: A dataset comprising 110,988 Google Streetview images taken from 56 cities, with accompanying perceptual attributes.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **OASIS**, the citation is:
  > Daniel S Marcus, Tracy H Wang, Jamie Parker, John GCsernansky, John C Morris, and Randy L Buckner. Openaccess series of imaging studies (OASIS): cross-sectionalMRI data in young, middle aged, nondemented, and demented older adults. Journal of cognitive neuroscience,19(9):1498a1507, 2007.

- For **Violence**, the citation is:
  > Donghyeon Won, Zachary C Steinert-Threlkeld, and Jungseock Joo. Protest activity detection and perceived violence estimation from social media images. In Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Multimedia Conference, pages 786a794. ACM, 2017.

- For **Coastcam**, the citation is:
  > M. Burke. Image ranking in video sequences using pairwise image comparisons and temporal smoothing. In 2016 Pattern Recognition Association of South Africa and Robotics and Mechatronics International Conference (PRASA-RobMech), pages 1a6, Nov 2016.

- For **Place Pulse 2.0**, the citation is:
  > Abhimanyu Dubey, Nikhil Naik, Devi Parikh, Ramesh Raskar, and CA esar A Hidalgo. Deep learning the city: In Quantifying urban perception at a global scale. European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 196a212. Springer, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
