To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive coordination of working-memory and reinforcement learning in non-human primates performing a trial-and-error problem solving task" by Guillaume Viejoa, BenoEAt Girarda, Emmanuel Procykc, Mehdi KhamassiaaSorbonne UniversitA es, UPMC Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Institute of Intelligent Systemsand Robotics (ISIR), F-75005 Paris, FrancebMontreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, 3801 University Street, Montreal, Quebec,Canada,cUniversity of Lyon, UniversitA e Claude Bernard Lyon 1, INSERM, Stem Cell and BrainResearch Institute U1208, Lyon, FranceAbstractAccumulating evidence suggest that human behavior in trial-and-error learn-ing tasks based on decisions between discrete actions may involve a combina-tion of reinforcement learning (RL) and working-memory (WM). While theunderstanding of brain activity at stake in this type of tasks often involvethe comparison with non-human primate neurophysiological results, it is notclear whether monkeys use similar combined RL and WM processes to solvethese tasks. Here we analyzed the behavior of ive monkeys with computa-tional models combining RL and WM. Our model-based analysis approachenables to not only it trial-by-trial choices but also transient slowdowns inreaction times, indicative of WM use. We found that the behavior of theive monkeys was better explained in terms of a combination of RL andWM despite inter-individual diierences. The same coordination dynamicswe used in a previous study in humans best explained the behavior of somemonkeys while the behavior of others showed the opposite pattern, revealinga possible diierent dynamics of WM process. We further analyzed diierentvariants of the tested models to open a discussion on how the long pretrainingin these tasks may have favored particular coordination dynamics betweenRL and WM. This points towards either inter-species diierences or protocoldiierences which could be further tested in humans.Email address: guillaume.viejo@mcgill.ca (Guillaume Viejo)Preprint submitted to Special Edition of Behavioural Brain ResearchMay 3, 2019 Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Decision-making, Working-Memory,Bayesian Inference, Computational Modeling, Model Comparison
