To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning with SurrogateAgent-Environment Interface" by Song Wangsong, Yu Jing, and others, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning and the possibility of changing the interface in algorithm level. They hint at the evaluation of the proposed algorithm on various tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Acrobot-v1**: A classic control task.
2. **Amidar-v0**: A classic control task.
3. **Atari 2600 game environment**: A game environment for Atari games.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the proposed algorithm.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Acrobot-v1**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Amidar-v0**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Atari 2600 game environment**, the citation is:
  > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. OpenAI Gym. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
