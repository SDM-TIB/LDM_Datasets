To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Averaged-DQN: Variance Reduction and Stabilization for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Oron Anschel, Nir Baram, and Nahum Shimkin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of Deep Q-Network (DQN) and the importance of variance reduction in reinforcement learning. They hint at the evaluation of DQN variants on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: A dataset of 15 classic arcade games.
2. **Breakout**: A dataset of the classic Atari game Breakout.
3. **SeaQuest**: A dataset of the classic Atari game SeaQuest.
4. **Asterix**: A dataset of the classic Atari game Asterix.
5. **Gridworld**: A dataset of a simple grid-based environment.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their Averaged-DQN algorithm, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ALE**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, Marc G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253–279, 2013.

- For **Breakout**, the citation is:
  > Mnih, Volodymyr, Kavukcuoglu, Koray, Silver, David, Graves, Alex, Antonoglou, Ioannis, Wierstra, Daan, and Riedmiller, Martin. Playing Atari with deep reinforcement learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.5602, 2013.

- For **SeaQuest**, the citation is:
  > Mnih, Volodymyr, Kavukcuoglu, Koray, Silver, David, Graves, Alex, Antonoglou, Ioannis, Wierstra, Daan, and Riedmiller, Martin. Playing Atari with deep reinforcement learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.5602, 2013.

- For **Asterix**, the citation is:
  > Van Hasselt, Hado, Guez, Arthur, and Silver, David. Deep reinforcement learning with double Q-learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:1509.06461, 2015.

- For **Gridworld**, the citation is:
  > Boyan, Justin and Moore, Andrew W. Generalization in reinforcement learning: Safely approximating the value function. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 369–376, 1995.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
