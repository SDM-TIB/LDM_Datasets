To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shallow Updates for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Nir Levinea, Tom Zahavy, and Daniel J. Mankowitz, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of reinforcement learning methods, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of deep reinforcement learning methods and the importance of combining them with shallow methods. They hint at the evaluation of these methods on various Atari games.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention five named Atari games:

1. **Asterix**
2. **Space Invaders**
3. **Breakout**
4. **Qbert**
5. **Bowling**

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their LS-DQN algorithm.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Asterix**, no specific citation is mentioned.
- For **Space Invaders**, no specific citation is mentioned.
- For **Breakout**, no specific citation is mentioned.
- For **Qbert**, no specific citation is mentioned.
- For **Bowling**, no specific citation is mentioned.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
