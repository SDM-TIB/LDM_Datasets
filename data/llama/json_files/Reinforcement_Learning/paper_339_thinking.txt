To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Value Iteration Networks: Life Beyond Lattices" by Sufeng Ni, Siheng Chen, Hanyu Guo, Colin Targonski, Melissa C. Smith, and Jelena KovaEcevi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the reinforcement learning task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning algorithms and the importance of generalizing to irregular structures. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three types of graphs:

1. **2D mazes**: A dataset used for evaluation of the proposed GVIN model.
2. **Irregular graphs**: A synthetic dataset generated for evaluation of the proposed GVIN model.
3. **Real-world street networks**: The Minnesota highway map and the New York City street map are used for evaluation of the proposed GVIN model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **2D mazes**, the citation is:
  > Tamar, A., Levine, S., Abbeel, P., WU, Y., and Thomas, G. *Value iteration networks*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2146a2154.

- For **Irregular graphs**, the citation is:
  > Defferrard, M.; Bresson, X.; and Vandergheynst, P. *Convolutional neural networks on graphs with fast localized spectral iltering*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 3837a3845.

- For **Real-world street networks**, the citation is:
  > The Minnesota highway map and the New York City street map are not explicitly cited, but they are mentioned as datasets used for evaluation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
