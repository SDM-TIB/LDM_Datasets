    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LEARNING MOVEMENT STRATEGIES FORMOVING TARGET DEFENSE" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of movement strategies for Moving Target Defense (MTD) systems, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing models for MTD and the importance of developing new strategies. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Web-application dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the effectiveness of MTD strategies for web-application security.
2. **Cloud-network dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the effectiveness of MTD strategies for cloud-network security.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Web-application dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sailik Sengupta, Satya Gautam Vadlamudi, Subbarao Kambhampati, Adam DoupA, Ziming Zhao, Marthony Taguinod, and Gail-Joon Ahn. *A game theoretic approach to strategy generation for moving target defense in web applications*. In Proceedings of the 16th Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, pages 1377a1378, 2016.

- For **Cloud-network dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sailik Sengupta, Ankur Chowdhary, Dijiang Huang, and Subbarao Kambhampati. General sum markov games for strategic detection of advanced persistent threats using moving target defense in cloud networks. In International Conference on Decision and Game Theory for Security, pages 492a512, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
