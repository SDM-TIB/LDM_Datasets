To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Energy-eficient Amortized Inference with Cascaded Deep Classiiers" by Jiaqi Guan, Yang Liu, Qiang Liu, and Jian Peng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of models on several image classification datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional deep neural networks and the importance of energy-efficient inference, which hints at the use of datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three image classification datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class.
3. **ImageNet**: A dataset of 1,000 visual classes, with 100,000 images per class.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., & Hinton, G. E. (2012). ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) (pp. 1097-1105).

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., & Hinton, G. E. (2012). ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) (pp. 1097-1105).

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In Proceedings of the 18th IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) (pp. 2482-2489).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
