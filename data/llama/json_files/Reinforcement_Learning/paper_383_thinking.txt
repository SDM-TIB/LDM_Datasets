To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Intentional Unintentional Agent:Learning to Solve Many Continuous Control TasksSimultaneously" by Serkan Cabi, Sergio G. A. Gomez, Matthew W. Hoffman, Misha Denil, Ziyu Wang, and Nando de Freitas, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the continuous control tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning methods and the importance of learning multiple tasks simultaneously. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MuJoCo physics engine**: A physics engine used to simulate the environment.
2. **Playroom environment**: A virtual environment with a tabletop and N objects placed on it.
3. **Grounded formal language**: A language used to automatically generate tasks and rewards.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MuJoCo physics engine**, the citation is:
  > T. Erez, Y. Tassa, and E. Todorov. Learning to act by imitating others. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 1325â€“1333, 2016.

- For **Playroom environment**, the citation is:
  > Not explicitly mentioned, but the authors mention the use of a virtual environment with a tabletop and N objects placed on it.

- For **Grounded formal language**, the citation is:
  > Not explicitly mentioned, but the authors mention the use of a formal language to automatically generate tasks and rewards.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
