To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Spatio-Temporal Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach for Cooperative Trafic Light Control" by Yanan Wang, Tong Xu, Xin Niu, Chang Tan, Enhong Chen, and Hui Xiong, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the multi-intersection trafic light control, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of prior arts in optimizing the use of individual trafic lights in an isolated way, and the importance of considering the spatio-temporal dependency among multiple trafic lights.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two real-world datasets:

1. **DHangzhou**: A publicly available dataset for city Hangzhou, China.
2. **DHef ei**: A real-world dataset collected from Hefei, China, which consists of four heterogeneous intersections.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DHangzhou**, the citation is:
  > CityLab,aTraficas mind-boggling2018.[Online]. Available: https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/02/trafics-mind-boggling-economic-toll/552488/economictoll,a13

- For **DHef ei**, the citation is:
  > Hua et al. [29] introduced a graph attention network for network-level trafic light control. However, neighbors of each agent were determined using rules with a predeined and ixed amount. The trafic iow direction on the graph was also not incorporated.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
