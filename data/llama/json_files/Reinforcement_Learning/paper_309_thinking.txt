To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Large-Scale Fleet Management on a Road Network using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning with Graph Neural Network" by Juhyeon Kim and Kihyun Kim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization of fleet management using multi-agent reinforcement learning with graph neural networks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous approaches to fleet management and the importance of considering the spatial structure of the road network. They hint at the use of empirical demand and supply data.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Taxi call data**: A dataset containing empirical taxi call data.
2. **Empirical demand and supply data**: A dataset containing empirical demand and supply data.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Taxi call data**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Empirical demand and supply data**, the citation is:
  > Not found

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
