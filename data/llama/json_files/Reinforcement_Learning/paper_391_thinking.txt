To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search" by David Silver, Julian Schrittwieser, Karen Simonyan, Ioannis Antonoglou, Aja Huang, Arthur Guez, Thomas Hubert, Lucas Baker, Matthew Lai, Adrian Bolton, Yutian Chen, Timothy Lillicrap, Fan Hui, Laurent Sifre, George van den Driessche, Thore Graepel, and Demis Hassabis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the AlphaGo Zero algorithm and its application to the game of Go, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the AlphaGo Zero algorithm and its ability to play the game of Go without human knowledge. They mention the use of self-play games to train the algorithm, but do not specify any particular datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named datasets:

1. **AlphaGo dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the AlphaGo Zero algorithm.
2. **Stockfish dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the AlphaZero algorithm against the strongest chess program, Stockish.
3. **Elmo dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the AlphaZero algorithm against the strongest shogi program, Elmo.
4. **Go dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the AlphaZero algorithm against the AlphaGo Lee and AlphaGo Zero algorithms.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **AlphaGo dataset**, the citation is:

- For **Elmo dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tord Romstad, Marco Costalba, Joona Kiiski, et al. Stockish: A strong open source chess engine. https://stockfishchess.org/. Retrieved November 29th, 2017.

- For **Go dataset**, the citation is:
  > David Silver, Julian Schrittwieser, Karen Simonyan, Ioannis Antonoglou, Aja Huang, Arthur Guez, Thomas Hubert, Lucas Baker, Matthew Lai, Adrian Bolton, Yutian Chen, Timothy Lillicrap, Fan Hui, Laurent Sifre, George van den Driessche, Thore Graepel, and Demis Hassabis. *Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search*. Nature, 529(7587):484a489, January 2016. https://doi.org/10.1038/nature16167

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
