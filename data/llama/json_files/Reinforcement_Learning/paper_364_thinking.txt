To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Mohammad Babaeizadeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the deep reinforcement learning tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of standard reinforcement learning methods and the importance of asynchronous methods. They hint at the evaluation of these methods on various Atari games.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named datasets:

1. **Atari 2600**: A dataset of Atari games.
2. **Boxing**: A dataset of the Boxing game.
3. **Centipede**: A dataset of the Centipede game.
4. **Pong**: A dataset of the Pong game.
5. **Qbert**: A dataset of the Qbert game.
6. **SeaQuest**: A dataset of the SeaQuest game.
7. **Up-Down**: A dataset of the Up-Down game.
8. **Breakout**: A dataset of the Breakout game.
9. **Space Invaders**: A dataset of the Space Invaders game.
10. **BeamRider**: A dataset of the BeamRider game.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their methods, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Atari 2600**, the citation is:
  > Brockman et al. (2016) learn to play Atari games through search.

- For **Boxing**, the citation is:
  > Not mentioned.

- For **Centipede**, the citation is:
  > Not mentioned.

- For **Pong**, the citation is:
  > Brockman et al. (2016) learn to play Atari games through search.

- For **Qbert**, the citation is:
  > Brockman et al. (2016) learn to play Atari games through search.

- For **SeaQuest**, the citation is:
  > Not mentioned.

- For **Up-Down**, the citation is:
  > Not mentioned.

- For **Breakout**, the citation is:
  > Brockman et al. (2016) learn to play Atari games through search.

- For **Space Invaders**, the citation is:
  > Not mentioned.

- For **BeamRider**, the citation is:
  > Not mentioned.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
