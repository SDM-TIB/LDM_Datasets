To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Factor Policies and Action-ValueFunctions: Factored Action Space Representations for Deep Reinforcement learning" by Sahil Sharma, Aravind S. Lakshminarayanan, and Balaraman Ravindran, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of Atari 2600 games and the decomposition of action spaces into independent components.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning algorithms and the importance of exploiting the underlying compositional structure in discrete action spaces.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the Atari 2600 dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the Atari 2600 dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Atari 2600 dataset:

- For Atari 2600, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, Marc G., Naddaf, Yavar, Veness, Joel, and Bowling, Michael. The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, pp. 253-279, June 2013.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
