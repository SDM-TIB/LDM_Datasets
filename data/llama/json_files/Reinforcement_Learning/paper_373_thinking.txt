To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TREEQN AND ATREEC:DIFFERENTIABLE TREE-STRUCTURED MODELS FORDEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING" by Gregory Farquhara, Tim Rocktaschel, and Maximilian Igla, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The introduction mentions the use of Atari games and a box-pushing environment, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe the use of the Atari 2600 suite and the box-pushing environment.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Atari 2600 suite**, the citation is:
  > Marc G. Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. J. Artif. Intell. Res.(JAIR), 47:253a279, 2013.

- For the **box-pushing environment**, the authors describe a custom environment but do not provide a citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
