To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DARLA: Improving Zero-Shot Transfer in Reinforcement Learning" by Irina Higgins et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of DeepMind Lab and MuJoCo for the experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of disentangled representations in deep reinforcement learning and propose the DARLA framework.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **DeepMind Lab**: A irst-person 3D game environment with rich visuals and realistic physics.
2. **MuJoCo**: A physics engine for model-based control.
3. **Jaco/MuJoCo**: A robotic arm with a matching MuJoCo simulation environment.
4. **DeepMind Lab**: A irst-person 3D game environment with rich visuals and realistic physics.
5. **MuJoCo**: A physics engine for model-based control.
6. **Jaco/MuJoCo**: A robotic arm with a matching MuJoCo simulation environment.
7. **DeepMind Lab**: A irst-person 3D game environment with rich visuals and realistic physics.
8. **MuJoCo**: A physics engine for model-based control.
9. **Jaco/MuJoCo**: A robotic arm with a matching MuJoCo simulation environment.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the DARLA framework.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DeepMind Lab**, the citation is:
  > Beattie, Charles, Leibo, Joel Z., Teplyashin, Denis, Ward, Tom,and et al, Marcus Wainwright. Deepmind lab. arxiv, 2016.
- For **MuJoCo**, the citation is:
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., and Tassa, Y. Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control. IROS, 2012.
- For **Jaco/MuJoCo**, the citation is:
  > Rusu, Andrei A., Vecerik, Matej, Rothrl, Thomas, Heess, Nicolas,Pascanu, Razvan, and Hadsell, Raia. Sim-to-real robot learningfrom pixels with progressive nets. arxiv, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
