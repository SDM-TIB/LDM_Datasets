To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Distance Relationships without Time Travel: Boosting the Performance of a Sparse Predictive Autoencoder in Sequence Modeling" by Jeremy Gordon, David Rawlinson, and Subutai Ahmad, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the language modeling task on the Penn Treebank dataset, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the sequence learning domain and the challenge of modeling relationships between related elements separated by long temporal distances. They mention the MNIST dataset as a task.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits.
2. **Penn Treebank**: A dataset of text for language modeling.
3. **PTB**: A dataset of text for language modeling.
4. **FastText**: A pre-trained word embedding model.
5. **JNLPBA**: A dataset of annotated proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
6. **BC2GM**: A dataset of gene mentions.
7. **CHEMDNER**: A dataset of annotated drugs and chemicals.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
