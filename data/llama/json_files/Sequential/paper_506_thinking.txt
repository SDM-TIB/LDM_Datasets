To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection of Social Media Disclosures of Sexual Harassment" by Arijit Ghosh Chowdhury et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the aggregation and analysis of social media disclosures, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the lack of specificity in generic sentence classification models and the need for a more nuanced approach to identify disclosures of sexual harassment. They hint at the creation of a manually annotated real-world dataset to test their technique.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Twitter dataset**: A dataset of anonymized tweets containing self-disclosures of sexual abuse, collected from November 2016 to December 2018.
2. **Reddit dataset**: A dataset of user posts containing tags of #metoo, sexual violence, and sexual harassment, collected from microblogging sites like Reddit.
3. **Tumblr dataset**: A dataset of user posts containing tags of #metoo, sexual violence, and sexual harassment, collected from microblogging sites like Tumblr.
4. **Sexual Harassment forums dataset**: A dataset of anonymized data from known Sexual Harassment forums, used to develop a corpus of words and phrases.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for the creation of their proposed Medium-Specific Disclosure Language Model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Twitter dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Reddit dataset**, the citation is:
  > Schrading et al. (2015) proposed the Domestic Abuse Disclosure (DAD) Model using the 1, 2, and 3-grams in the text, the predicates, and the semantic role labels as features, including TF-IDF and Bag of Words.

- For **Tumblr dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Sexual Harassment forums dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not found

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
