To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Source-Conditional Elmo-style Modelfor Machine Translation Quality Estimation" by Junpei Zhou, Zhisong Zhang, and Zecong Hua, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the WMT 2019 QE task and the use of parallel data and QE data.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of quality estimation in machine translation and the need for a task-oriented approach.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **WMT 2018 En-De-SMT**: A dataset used for machine translation.
2. **WMT 2018 En-De-NMT**: A dataset used for machine translation.
3. **WMT 2019 En-De-NMT**: A dataset used for machine translation.
4. **WMT 2019 En-Ru-NMT**: A dataset used for machine translation.
5. **Parallel QE train, dev, test**: A dataset used for quality estimation.
6. **QE train, dev, test**: A dataset used for quality estimation.
7. **En-De-SMT**: A dataset used for machine translation.
8. **En-De-NMT**: A dataset used for machine translation.
9. **En-Ru-NMT**: A dataset used for machine translation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WMT 2018 En-De-SMT**, the citation is:
  > Snover, T. J., et al. (2006). A study of translation edit rate with targeted human annotation. In Proceedings of the 12th Conference of the Association for Machine Translation in the Americas, pages 1–10.

- For **WMT 2018 En-De-NMT**, the citation is:
  > Kim and Lee (2016) A recurrent neural networks approach for estimating the quality of machine translation output.

- For **WMT 2019 En-De-NMT**, the citation is:
  > Wang et al. (2018) Alibaba submission for WMT18 quality estimation task.

- For **WMT 2019 En-Ru-NMT**, the citation is:
  > Wang et al. (2018) Alibaba submission for WMT18 quality estimation task.

- For **Parallel QE train, dev, test**, the citation is:
  > Wang et al. (2018) Alibaba submission for WMT18 quality estimation task.

- For **QE train, dev, test**, the citation is:
  > Wang et al. (2018) Alibaba submission for WMT18 quality estimation task.

- For **En-De-SMT**, the citation is:
  > Snover, T. J., et al. (2006). A study of translation edit rate with targeted human annotation. In Proceedings of the 12th Conference of the Association for Machine Translation in the Americas, pages 1–10.

- For **En-De-NMT**, the citation is:
  > Kim and Lee (2016) A recurrent neural networks approach for estimating the quality of machine translation output.

- For **En-Ru-NMT**, the citation is:
  > Wang et al. (2018) Alibaba submission for WMT18 quality estimation task.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
