To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLP at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Multi-Encoder in Hierarchical Attention Networks for Contextual Emotion Detection" by Changjie Li and Yun Xing, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the participation of team aCLPa in SemEval-2019 Task 3, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of emotion detection in text and the limitations of traditional rule-based approaches and machine learning methods.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SemEval-2019 Task 3 dataset**: This dataset is used for contextual emotion detection in text.
2. **Twitter dataset**: This dataset is used for training and testing the proposed system.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SemEval-2019 Task 3 dataset**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For **Twitter dataset**, the authors mention that they use Ekphrasis to normalize the utterance, which is a text processing pipeline designed for social network texts.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their descriptions from the paper.
