To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural Language Generation for Effective Knowledge Distillation" by Raphael Tang, Yao Lu, and Jimmy Lin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of four datasets in sentiment classification, sentence similarity, and linguistic acceptability.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of constructing an unlabeled transfer dataset for knowledge distillation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention four named datasets:

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank-2 (SST-2)**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification.
2. **Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA)**: This dataset is used for linguistic acceptability.
3. **Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B)**: This dataset is used for sentence similarity.
4. **Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC)**: This dataset is used for paraphrasing.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SST-2**, the citation is:
  > Socher et al. (2013) *Semantically Evaluating Sentences*.

- For **CoLA**, the citation is:
  > Warstadt et al. (2018) *Neural network acceptability judgments*.

- For **STS-B**, the citation is:
  > Cer et al. (2017) *SemEval-2017 task 1: Semantic textual similarity multilingual and cross-lingual focused evaluation*.

- For **MRPC**, the citation is:
  > Dolan and Brockett (2005) *Automatically constructing a corpus of sentential paraphrases*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
