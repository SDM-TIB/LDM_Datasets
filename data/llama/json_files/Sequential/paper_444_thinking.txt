To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection of Adverse Drug Reaction mentions in tweets using ELMo" by Sarah Sarabadani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of ELMo embeddings for detecting adverse drug reaction mentions in tweets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of detecting adverse drug reaction mentions in tweets and the use of ELMo embeddings for this task.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Twitter dataset**: A collection of 25,672 tweets, including 2,374 positive and 23,298 negative tweets, and approximately 5,000 unlabeled tweets.
2. **Validation set**: A subset of 1,000 tweets, including 500 positive and 500 negative tweets.
3. **Evaluation data**: A subset of 1,000 tweets, including 500 positive and 500 negative tweets.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Twitter dataset**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.
- For **Validation set**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.
- For **Evaluation data**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
