To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spot the Odd Man Out: Exploring the Associative Power of Lexical Resources" by Gabriel Stanovsky and Mark Hopkins, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the creation of several Odd-Man-Out datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of evaluating lexical resources and the limitations of existing methods. They hint at the creation of new datasets for this purpose.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **ANOMIACOMMONDEV**: A dataset of odd-man-out puzzles created using a crowdsourcing protocol.
2. **ANOMIACOMMONTEST**: A test set of odd-man-out puzzles created using the same crowdsourcing protocol as ANOMIACOMMONDEV.
3. **ANOMIAPROPERDEV**: A development set of odd-man-out puzzles created using a curated annotation protocol.
4. **ANOMIAPROPERTEST**: A test set of odd-man-out puzzles created using the same curated annotation protocol as ANOMIAPROPERDEV.
5. **CROWD-SOURCED843**: A dataset of odd-man-out puzzles created using a crowdsourcing protocol, with a focus on high-quality annotations.
6. **WordNet**: A lexical database that provides a sense of the meaning of words.
7. **ELMo clusters**: A dataset of word embeddings created using the ELMo model.
8. **HYPERNYMS500**: A dataset of odd-man-out puzzles created using a hypernym-based approach.
9. **COLORS500**: A dataset of odd-man-out puzzles created using a color-based approach.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ANOMIACOMMONDEV**, the citation is:
  > Gabriel Stanovsky and Mark Hopkins. *Spot the Odd Man Out: Exploring the Associative Power of Lexical Resources*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1533-1542, 2018.

- For **ANOMIACOMMONTEST**, the citation is:
  > Gabriel Stanovsky and Mark Hopkins. *Spot the Odd Man Out: Exploring the Associative Power of Lexical Resources*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1533-1542, 2018.

- For **ANOMIAPROPERDEV**, the citation is:
  > Gabriel Stanovsky and Mark Hopkins. *Spot the Odd Man Out: Exploring the Associative Power of Lexical Resources*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1533-1542, 2018.

- For **ANOMIAPROPERTEST**, the citation is:
  > Gabriel Stanovsky and Mark Hopkins. *Spot the Odd Man Out: Exploring the Associative Power of Lexical Resources*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1533-1542, 2018.

- For **CROWD-SOURCED843**, the citation is:
  > Gabriel Stanovsky and Mark Hopkins. *Spot the Odd Man Out: Exploring the Associative Power of Lexical Resources*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1533-1542, 2018.

- For **WordNet**, the citation is:
  > Miller, 1992.

- For **ELMo clusters**, the citation is:
  > Peters et al., 2018.

- For **HYPERNYMS500**, the citation is:
  > The dataset was created by Gabriel Stanovsky and Mark Hopkins.

- For **COLORS500**, the citation is:
  > The dataset was created by Gabriel Stanovsky and Mark Hopkins.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
