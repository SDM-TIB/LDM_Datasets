To extract datasets from the research paper titled "YNU DYX at SemEval-2019 Task 5: A Stacked BiGRU Model Based onCapsule Network in Detection of Hate" by Yunxia Ding, Xiaobing Zhoua, Xuejie Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the SemEval 2019 Task 5, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the problem of detecting hate speech on tweets and mention the task organizer's provided training sets, development sets, and test sets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SemEval 2019 Task 5 training set**: A binary classification task of hate speech about immigrants or women.
2. **SemEval 2019 Task 5 development set**: A binary classification task of hate speech about immigrants or women.
3. **SemEval 2019 Task 5 test set**: A binary classification task of hate speech about immigrants or women.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SemEval 2019 Task 5 training set**, development set, and test set, the citations are not explicitly mentioned in the paper. However, the authors mention the task organizer's provided datasets, which are likely the same as the training set, development set, and test set.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
