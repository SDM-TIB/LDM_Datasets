To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Structural Probe for Finding Syntax in Word Representations" by John Hewitt and Christopher D. Manning, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the Penn Treebank and the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) is mentioned in the introduction.

In the **methods section**, the authors mention the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) as a dataset used for parsing tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Penn Treebank:

- For the Penn Treebank, the citation is:
  > Mitchell P. Marcus, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, and Beatrice Santorini. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational linguistics, 19(2):313â€“330, 1993.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
