To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Grammatical Error Detection with Contextual Word Representations" by Samuel Bella, Helen Yannakoudakis, and Marek Rei, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of public GED datasets for training and evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of error detection as a purely supervised task and the importance of using contextualized word representations.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named datasets:

1. **The First Certificate in English (FCE) dataset**: A publicly-released set of essays written by non-native learners of English taking a language assessment exam.
2. **The CoNLL 2014 shared task dataset**: A dataset of English essays written by advanced undergraduate students at the National University of Singapore.
3. **The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) FLuency-Extended GUG Corpus**: A dataset containing essays written by a range of English learners with different first languages and proficiency levels.
4. **The Cambridge English Write & Improve (W&I) corpus**: A collection of texts written by learners of English of varying levels of proficiency and submitted for assessment to the Write & Improve system.
5. **The LOCNESS corpus**: A dataset comprising essays written by native English students.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **FCE**, the citation is:
  > Yannakoudakis, H., Andersen, A., Geranpayeh, A., Briscoe, T., & Nicholls, D. (2011). A new dataset and method for automatically grading ESOL texts. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 180-189.

- For **CoNLL 2014**, the citation is:

- For **JHU FLUENCY-EXTENDED GUG Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Napoles, C., Sakaguchi, K., & Tetreault, J. (2017). JFLEG: A fluency corpus and benchmark for grammatical error correction. In Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 229-234.

- For **Cambridge English Write & Improve (W&I) corpus**, the citation is:
  > Yannakoudakis, H., Andersen, A., Geranpayeh, A., Briscoe, T., & Nicholls, D. (2018). Developing an automated writing placement system for ESL learners. Applied Measurement in Education, 31(3), 251-267.

- For **LOCNESS corpus**, the citation is:
  > Granger, S. (1998). The computer learner corpus: A versatile new source of data for SLA research. In Learner English on Computer, pages 3-18.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
