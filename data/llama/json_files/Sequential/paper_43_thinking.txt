To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning for Causal Sentence Detection" by Manolis Kyriakakis et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the task of detecting causal sentences, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing relation extraction datasets and the importance of using transfer learning for causal sentence detection. They hint at the use of several datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SemEval-2010 (Task 8)**: This dataset contains 10,674 samples, of which 1,325 causal.
2. **CausalTB**: This dataset contains 2,470 sentences, of which 244 are causal.
3. **EventSL**: This dataset contains 4,107 sentences, of which 77 are causal.
4. **BioCausal**: This dataset contains 13,342 sentences from PUBMED, of which 7,562 are causal.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SemEval-2010 (Task 8)**, the citation is:
  > Hendrickx et al. (2009) SemEval-2010 Task 8: Multi-way classification of semantic relations between pairs of nominals.

- For **CausalTB**, the citation is:
  > Mirza et al. (2014) Annotating causality in the temporal-3 corpus.

- For **EventSL**, the citation is:
  > Caselli and Vossen (2017) The event storyline corpus: A new benchmark for causal and temporal relation extraction.

- For **BioCausal**, the citation is:
  > Li and Mao (2019) Knowledge-oriented convolutional neural network for causal relation extraction from natural language texts.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
