To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer and seq2seq model for Paraphrase Generation" by Elozino Egonmwan and Yllias Chali, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed framework on two datasets: QUORA and MSCOCO.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of paraphrase generation and the need for high-quality paraphrases.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **QUORA**: A dataset containing question pairs.
2. **MSCOCO**: A dataset containing free-form texts.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the proposed framework.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **QUORA**, the citation is:
  > https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor3

- For **MSCOCO**, the citation is:
  > https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/seq2seq/sequence_loss4

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
