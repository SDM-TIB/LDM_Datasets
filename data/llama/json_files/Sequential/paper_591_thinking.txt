To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HumorHawk at SemEval-2017 Task 6: Mixing Meaning and Sound for Humor Recognition" by David Donahue, Alexey Romanov, and Anna Rumshisky, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the SemEval-2017 Task 6: #HashtagWars:Learning a Sense of Humor, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of feature-based approaches and the use of recurrent deep learning methods with dense embeddings for humor detection. They hint at the use of the #HashtagWars dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named datasets:

1. **#HashtagWars dataset**: This dataset is used for humor detection tasks.
2. **CMUPronouncing Dictionary corpus**: This corpus is used to train the character-to-phoneme model.
3. **GloVe word embeddings**: This dataset is used as a pre-trained word embedding for the embedding humor model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **#HashtagWars dataset**, the citation is:
  > Potash et al. (2016b) provided for SemEval-2016 Task 6 assumes that humor can be evaluated ona scale, reiecting the reality that humor is non-binary and some things may be seen as funnierthan others.

- For **CMUPronouncing Dictionary corpus**, the citation is:
  > Lenzo (2017) contains mappings from each word to its corresponding phonemes.

- For **GloVe word embeddings**, the citation is:
  > Pennington et al. (2014) Glove: Global vectors for word representation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
