To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Concordia NLG Surface Realizer at SRa19Farhood Farahnak and Laya Raiee and Leila Kosseim and Thomas FevensDept. of Computer Science and Software EngineeringConcordia UniversityMontreal, Canada" I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the model developed for the shallow track of the 2019 NLG Surface Realization Shared Task. The introduction discusses the problem of surface realization and the use of pointer networks and transformer models.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the Universal Dependency (UD) datasets.

In the **materials and methods section**, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Universal Dependency (UD) datasets**: These datasets were taken from the Universal Dependency datasets (de Marneffe et al., 2014).
2. **English datasets**: The authors mention four English datasets: en ewt-ud-train, en gum-ud-train, en lines-ud-train, and en partut-ud-train.
3. **Development sets**: The authors mention that the development sets provided by the SRa19 organizers are not labeled.

In the **results section**, the authors mention that the model was trained on a concatenated training set containing 19,976 sentences, with the longest sentence containing 209 words.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Universal Dependency (UD) datasets**, the citation is:
  > Marie-Catherine de Marneffe, Timothy Dozat, Natalia Silveira, Katri Haverinen, Filip Ginter, Joakim Nivre, and Christopher D. Manning. 2014. Universal Stanford dependencies: A cross-linguistic typology. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-2014), pages 4585-4592, Reykjavik, Iceland. European Languages Resources Association (ELRA).

- For **English datasets**, the citations are:
  > en ewt-ud-train: [32]
  > en gum-ud-train: [32]
  > en lines-ud-train: [32]
  > en partut-ud-train: [32]

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
