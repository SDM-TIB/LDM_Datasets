To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Named Entity Recognition - Is there a glass ceiling?" by Tomasz Stanislawek, Anna Wrolblewska, Alicja Wojcik, Daniel Ziembicki, Przemyslaw Biecek, and Applica.ai, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the CoNLL2003 data set for the English language, which suggests that a dataset is likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the problem of Named Entity Recognition (NER) and the importance of understanding the sources of errors in NER models. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the CoNLL2003 data set and introduce new diagnostic data sets.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the CoNLL2003 data set was used for evaluation of their models, which reinforces its relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CoNLL2003 data set:

- For **CoNLL2003**, the citation is:
  > Tomas V. V. Silveira, and Christopher D. Manning. *A comparison of feature extraction methods for named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 113-121, 2002.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
