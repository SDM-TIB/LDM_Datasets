To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the 20th SIGNLL Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), pages 51a61,Berlin, Germany, August 7-12, 2016. c2016 Association for Computational Linguistics" I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the NLP tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of context representations in NLP tasks, which hints at the use of datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **ukWaC**: A large corpus of text used for training and evaluation of word embeddings.
2. **Senseval-3**: A lexical sample dataset used for supervised word sense disambiguation.
3. **MSCC**: A sentence completion challenge dataset.
4. **LST-07**: A lexical substitution task dataset.
5. **LST-14**: A lexical substitution task dataset.
6. **SE-3**: A supervised word sense disambiguation dataset.
7. **CHEMDNER**: A corpus of chemical names and drugs.
8. **JNLPBA**: A corpus of annotated proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
9. **BC2GM**: A corpus of annotated gene mentions.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
