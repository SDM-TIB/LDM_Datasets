To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distilling Knowledge in BERT for Text Generation" by Yen-Chun Chen, Zhe Gan, Yu Cheng, Jingzhou Liu, and Jingjing Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the text generation task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of using pre-trained BERT for text generation and the importance of leveraging bidirectional language models. They hint at the evaluation of their approach on multiple text generation tasks, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **IWSLT14 German-English**: A machine translation dataset.
2. **IWSLT15 English-Vietnamese**: A machine translation dataset.
3. **WMT14 English-German**: A machine translation dataset.
4. **Gigaword**: An abstractive summarization dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their approach, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **IWSLT14 German-English**, the citation is:
  > Wu et al. (2019) [32]

- For **IWSLT15 English-Vietnamese**, the citation is:
  > Chen et al. (2019) [33]

- For **WMT14 English-German**, the citation is:
  > Vaswani et al. (2017) [34]

- For **Gigaword**, the citation is:
  > Rush et al. (2015) [35]

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
