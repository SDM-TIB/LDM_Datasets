To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SWAP at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Emotion detection in conversations through Tweets, CNN and LSTM deep neural networks" by Marco Polignano et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the EmoContext task at SemEval-2019, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of emotion detection from user-generated contents and mention the EmoContext task.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **EmoContext dataset**: This dataset is used for emotion detection in conversations through Tweets.
2. **SemEval 2019 Task 3 dataset**: This dataset is used for the EmoContext task at SemEval-2019.
3. **Sentiment140 dataset**: This dataset is used to create word embeddings for sentiment analysis.
4. **Glove dataset**: This dataset is used to create word embeddings for sentiment analysis.
5. **Google word embeddings**: This dataset is used to create word embeddings for sentiment analysis.
6. **Generic Tweets dataset**: This dataset is used to create word embeddings for sentiment analysis.
7. **Twitter dataset**: This dataset is used for hate speech detection.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
