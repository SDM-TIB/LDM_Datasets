To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLEARumor at SemEval-2019 Task 7: ConvoLving ELMo Against Rumors" by Ipek Baris, Lukas Schmelzeisen, and Steffen Staab, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the RumourEval 2019 dataset, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the RumourEval 2019 dataset, which is used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the RumourEval 2019 dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the RumourEval 2019 dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the RumourEval 2019 dataset:

- For RumourEval 2019, the citation is:
  > Genevieve Gorrell, Kalina Bontcheva, Leon Derczynski, Elena Kochkina, Maria Liakata, and Arkaitz Zubiaga. *SemEval-2019 Task 7: RumourEval: Determining Rumour Veracity and Support for Rumours*. In SemEval@NAACL-HLT, pages 1237-1247, 2019. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/S19-1111

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
