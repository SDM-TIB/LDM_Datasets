To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AdaBERT: Task-Adaptive BERT Compression with Differentiable Neural Architecture Search" by Daoyuan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of AdaBERT on several NLP tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing BERT compression methods and propose AdaBERT as a novel compression method.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention six datasets from the GLUE benchmark:

1. **SST-2**: Sentiment Sentiment Analysis
2. **MRPC**: Multi-RC
3. **QQP**: Question-Question Pair
4. **MNLI**: Multi-Label Intent Classification
5. **QNLI**: Question-Answering
6. **RTE**: Reading Comprehension

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of AdaBERT.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SST-2**, the citation is:
  > [32]

- For **MRPC**, the citation is:
  > [32]

- For **QQP**, the citation is:
  > [32]

- For **MNLI**, the citation is:
  > [32]

- For **QNLI**, the citation is:
  > [32]

- For **RTE**, the citation is:
  > [32]

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
