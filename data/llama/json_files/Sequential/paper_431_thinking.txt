To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation of Stacked Embeddings for Bulgarian on the Downstream Tasks POS and NER" by Civa Marinova, LMA KPIICT-BASSoia, Bulgaria, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of several datasets for Bulgarian NLP tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of using Bulgarian language models for downstream tasks such as NamedEntity Recognition and Classiication.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **BulTreeBank (BTB)**: This dataset is used for POS tagging and Named Entity Recognition tasks.
2. **CLaDA-BG**: This dataset is used for downstream tasks such as Named Entity Recognition, Event Classiication, and Relation Extraction.
3. **Second Multilingual Named Entity Challenge in Slavic languages**: This dataset is used for Named Entity Recognition task.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **BulTreeBank (BTB)**, the citation is:
  > Simov et al. (2002) Building a linguistically interpreted corpus of Bulgarian: The BulTreeBank.
- For **CLaDA-BG**, the citation is:
  > CLaDA-BG (Bulgarian National Research Infrastructure for Language, Culture and History Resources and Tools)
- For **Second Multilingual Named Entity Challenge in Slavic languages**, the citation is:
  > Piskorski et al. (2019) Second Multilingual Named Entity Challenge in Slavic languages.
