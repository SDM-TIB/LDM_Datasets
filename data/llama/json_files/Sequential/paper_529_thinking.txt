To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CX-ST-RNM at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Fusion of Recurrent Neural Networks Based on Contextualized and Static Word Representations for Contextual Emotion Detection" by Michal Perel-Kiewicz, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the EmoContext task and the SemEval 2019 competition, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the EmoContext task and the limitations of previous approaches, which hints at the use of datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **EmoContext dataset**: This dataset is used for the EmoContext task.
2. **SemEval 2019 datasets**: The authors mention that they used datasets from the SemEval 2019 competition, but they do not specify which ones.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that they used the EmoContext dataset for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **EmoContext dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ankush Chatterjee, Kedhar Nath Narahari, Meghana Joshi, and Puneet Agrawal. *Semeval-2019 task 3: Emocontext: Contextual emotion detection*. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), pages 1-8, 2019. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/S19-1021

- For **SemEval 2019 datasets**, the citation is:
  > Ankush Chatterjee, Kedhar Nath Narahari, Meghana Joshi, and Puneet Agrawal. *Semeval-2019 task 3: Emocontext: Contextual emotion detection*. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), pages 1-8, 2019. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/S19-1021

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
