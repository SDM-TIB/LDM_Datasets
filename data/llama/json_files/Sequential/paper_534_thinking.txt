To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Labeled Parsing with Deep Inside-Outside Recursive Autoencoders" by Andrew Drozdov, Pat Verga, Yi-Pei Chen, Mohit Iyyer, and Andrew McCallum, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the model on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) dataset.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the focus on labeled constituency parsing for English and the limitations of previous works.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Wall Street Journal (WSJ) dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the model.
2. **ELMo**: This dataset is used for comparison with the proposed model.
3. **BERT**: This dataset is used for comparison with the proposed model.
4. **Proto**: This dataset is used for comparison with the proposed model.
5. **BMM**: This dataset is used for comparison with the proposed model.
6. **JNLPBA**: This dataset is used for comparison with the proposed model.
7. **CHEMDNER**: This dataset is used for comparison with the proposed model.
8. **WSJ-10**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
