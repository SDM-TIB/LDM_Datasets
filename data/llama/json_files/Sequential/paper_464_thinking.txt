To extract datasets from the research paper titled "In-domain Context-aware Token Embeddings Improve Biomedical Named Entity Recognition" by Golnar Sheikhshab, Simon Fraser University, Inanc Birol, British Columbia Cancer Agency, and Anoop Sarkar, Simon Fraser University, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the biomedical domain, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of word2vec and the importance of character-based representations like fastText. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named entity recognition corpora:

1. **BC2GM**: This dataset is used for gene recognition tasks.
2. **JNLPBA**: This corpus annotates proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
3. **PMC dataset**: This dataset is used for training ELMo.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **BC2GM**, the citation is:
  > Larry Smith, Lorraine K Tanabe, Rie Johnson nee Ando, Cheng-Ju Kuo, I-Fang Chung, Chun-Nan Hsu, Yu-Shi Lin, Roman Klinger, Christoph M Friedrich, Kuzman Ganchev, et al. *Overview of biocreative ii gene mention recognition*. Genome biology, 9(Suppl 2):1–19, 2008. https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2008-9-s2-s2

- For **JNLPBA**, the citation is:
  > Jin-Dong Kim, Tomoko Ohta, Yoshimasa Tsuruoka, Yuka Tateisi, and Nigel Collier. *Introduction to the bio-entity recognition task at JNLPBA*. In Proceedings of the 2004 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), pages 70–75, 2004. http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-1213

- For **PMC dataset**, the authors mention that they collected a focused domain-specific subset of PubMed Central (PMC) documents.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
