To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning for Hindi Text Classification : A Comparison" by Ramchandra Joshi, Purvi Goel, and Raviraj Joshi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the usage of translated versions of English datasets to evaluate models based on CNN, LSTM, and Attention. The introduction discusses the limitations of large labeled corpus for Hindi language and the importance of using multilingual pre-trained sentence embeddings.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the translation of standard datasets like TREC and SST to Hindi using Google Translate.

In the **materials and methods section**, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **TREC question dataset**: A dataset used for Hindi text classification, with pre-defined train-test split.
2. **SST-1 and SST-2**: Datasets used for Hindi text classification, with pre-defined train-test-dev split.
3. **XNLI**: A multilingual dataset used for evaluation of natural language inference tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors evaluate the performance of different models on the translated datasets.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their descriptions from the paper.
