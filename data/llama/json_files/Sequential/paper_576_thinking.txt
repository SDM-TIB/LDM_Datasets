To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language Modeling Teaches You More Syntax than Translation Does:Lessons Learned Through Auxiliary Task Analysis" by Kelly W. Zhang, Samuel R. Bowman, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the language modeling and translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of word2vec and the importance of character-based representations like fastText. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named datasets:

1. **WMT 2016**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks.
2. **Parallel En-De corpus**: This dataset is used for language modeling and translation tasks.
3. **Penn Treebank WSJ**: This dataset is used for part-of-speech tagging.
4. **Combinatorial Categorical Grammar (CCG) Bank**: This dataset is used for CCG supertagging.
5. **WMT monolingual corpus**: This dataset is used to augment the parallel data.
6. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: This dataset is used for gene recognition tasks.
7. **JNLPBA corpus**: This corpus annotates proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
8. **CHEMDNER corpus**: This dataset is focused on annotating drugs and chemicals.
9. **CCG Bank**: This dataset is used for CCG supertagging.
10. **Penn Treebank**: This dataset is used for part-of-speech tagging.
11. **WMT 2016 (small)**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks.
12. **WMT 2016 (large)**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks.
13. **WMT 2016 (skip-thought)**: This dataset is used for skip-thought tasks.
14. **WMT 2016 (autoencoding)**: This dataset is used for autoencoding tasks.
15. **WMT 2016 (BiLM)**: This dataset is used for bidirectional language modeling tasks.
