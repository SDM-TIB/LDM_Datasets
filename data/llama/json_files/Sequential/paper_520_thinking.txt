To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Role of Protected Class Word Lists in Bias Identification of Contextualized Word Representations" by JoEao Sedoc and Lyle Ungar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of word lists for debiasing contextualized word embeddings, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of debiasing contextualized word embeddings and the need for large, heterogeneous lists of target words.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Caliskan et al. (2017)**: A list of pronouns used for debiasing.
2. **Gaddis (2017)**: A list of racial names used for debiasing.
3. **Wang et al. (2019)**: A list of gender-specific words used for debiasing.
4. **ELMo and BERT**: Contextualized word embeddings used for evaluation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Caliskan et al. (2017)**, the citation is:
  > Aylin Caliskan,and ArvindJoanna J Bryson,Narayanan. 2017. Semantics derived automaticallyfrom language corpora contain human-like biases.Science, 356(6334):183a186.

- For **Gaddis (2017)**, the citation is:
  > Michael Gaddis. 2017. How black are lakisha andjamal? racial perceptions from names used in correspondence audit studies. Sociological Science, 4:469a489.

- For **Wang et al. (2019)**, the citation is:
  > Tianlu Wang, Jieyu Zhao, Mark Yatskar, Ryan Cot-terell, Vicente Ordonez, and Kai-Wei Chang. 2019. Gender bias in contextualized word embeddings.In North American Chapter of the Association forComputational Linguistics (NAACL).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
