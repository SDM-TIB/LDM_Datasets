To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probing the phonetic and phonological knowledge of tones in Mandarin TTS models" by Jian Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of controlled stimuli for testing tonal coarticulation and tone sandhi in Mandarin, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of TTS models in capturing the Tone-3 sandhi rules and the importance of designing linguistically informed stimuli. They hint at the use of the Chinese Standard Mandarin Speech Corpus (CSMSC) for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the Chinese Standard Mandarin Speech Corpus (CSMSC) and the stimuli for tonal coarticulation and tone sandhi experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the CSMSC was used for training and evaluation of the TTS models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CSMSC:

- For **CSMSC**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
