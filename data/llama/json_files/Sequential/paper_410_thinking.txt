To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probing Biomedical Embeddings from Language Models" by Qiao Jin, Bhuwan Dhingra, William W. Cohen, and Xinghua Lu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various biomedical datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of several biomedical datasets, including:

1. **BC2GM**: A biomedical named entity recognition dataset.
2. **MedNLI**: A biomedical natural language inference dataset.
3. **PubMed**: A biomedical corpus used for training the BioELMo model.
4. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus**: A dataset for gene recognition tasks.
5. **JNLPBA**: A dataset for bio-entity recognition.
6. **CHEMDNER**: A dataset for chemical names extraction.
7. **SNLI**: A general-domain natural language inference dataset.

In the **methods section**, the authors mention the use of the following datasets:

1. **BC2GM**: Used for named entity recognition tasks.
2. **MedNLI**: Used for natural language inference tasks.
3. **PubMed**: Used for training the BioELMo model.
4. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus**: Used for gene recognition tasks.
5. **JNLPBA**: Used for bio-entity recognition tasks.
6. **CHEMDNER**: Used for chemical names extraction tasks.
7. **SNLI**: Used for natural language inference tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
