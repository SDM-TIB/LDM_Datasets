To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Tale of Two Hierarchical Models" by Vishwajeet Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed models on the SQuAD and MSMARCO datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of question generation from paragraphs and mention the widely used SQuAD and MSMARCO datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named datasets:

1. **SQuAD**: A widely used dataset for question generation from paragraphs.
2. **MSMARCO**: A dataset for question generation from paragraphs.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the proposed models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). SQuAD: 100,000+ questions from a new SQuAD dataset. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383-2392.

- For **MSMARCO**, the citation is:
  > Nguyen, T. T., Grangier, R., & Callaway, C. (2016). MS MARCO: A large-scale search engine as a question answering service. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1880-1889.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
