To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning Techniques for Humor Detection in Hindi-English Code-Mixed Tweets" by Sushmitha Reddy Sane, Suraj Tripathi, Koushik Reddy Sane, and Radhika Mamidi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of Twitter data to create bilingual word embeddings, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the lack of data in general text-corpora for conducting experiments on code-mixed data.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Benchmark dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the effectiveness of bilingual word embeddings and proposed deep learning models.
2. **Twitter data**: This dataset is used to create bilingual word embeddings.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **benchmark dataset**, the citation is:
  > Khandelwal et al. (2018) presents the benchmark dataset for humor detection in English-Hindi code-mixed social media content.

- For the **Twitter data**, the authors mention that they used Twitter data to train the bilingual word embedding model.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
