To extract datasets from the research paper titled "JU ETCE 17 21 at SemEval-2019 Task 6: Efficient Machine Learning and Neural Network Approaches for Identifying and Categorizing Offensive Language in Tweets" by Mainak Pal, Preeti Mukherjee, Somnath Banerjee, and Sudip Kumar Naskar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the SemEval 2019 shared task 6: aOffensEval: Identifying and Catego-rizing Offensive Language in Social Media, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the problem of automatic text categorization and the importance of identifying and categorizing offensive language in tweets. They hint at the use of datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **OffensEval dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the models.
2. **HateSpeech Detection dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the models.
3. **TRAC dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the models.
4. **GermEval dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the models.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **OffensEval dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zampieri et al. (2019b). SemEval-2019 Task 6: Identifying and Categorizing Offensive Language in Social Media (OffensEval). In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval). https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/S19-1021

- For **HateSpeech Detection dataset**, the citation is:
  > Davidson et al. (2017). Automated Hate Speech Detection and the Problem of Offensive Language. In Proceedings of ICWSM.

- For **TRAC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kumar et al. (2018). Benchmarking Aggression Identification in Social Media. In Proceedings of the First Workshop on Trolling, Aggression and Cyber-bulling (TRAC), Santa Fe, USA.

- For **GermEval dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wiegand et al. (2018). Overview of the GermEval 2018 Shared Task on the Identification of Offensive Language. In Proceedings of GermEval.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
