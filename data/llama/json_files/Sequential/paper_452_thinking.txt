To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Joint Neural Network for Redundancy Detection" by Xinyu Fu, Eugene Changa, Uwe Aickelina, Simon Seea, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed model on four popular benchmarking corpora.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional methods and the recent advances on deep neural networks for text classification.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention four named datasets:

1. **Google-news**: A small portion of excerpts from the online platform giant Google.
2. **Twenty-news-groups**: A dataset originated from the publishers twenty-news-groups.
3. **Brown Corpus**: A corpus of standard American English, often abbreviated as the Brown Corpus.
4. **Question Classiication**: A collection of 50 classes of texts.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the proposed model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Google-news**, the citation is:
  > Google-news is a small portion of excerpts from the online platform giant Google

- For **Twenty-news-groups**, the citation is:
  > twenty-news-groups was originated from the publishers twenty-news-groups

- For **Brown Corpus**, the citation is:
  > The Brown Corpus encompasses with one million to-kens of American English texts sampled from 15 different textual categories.

- For **Question Classiication**, the citation is:
  > The question classiication collection contains 50 classes of texts.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
