To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Retroitting Contextualized Word Embeddings with Paraphrases" by Weijia Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the paraphrase task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of contextualized word embedding models and the importance of paraphrase-aware retroitting. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various sentence-level tasks and paraphrase corpora.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three paraphrase corpora:

1. **MRPC**: A paraphrase corpus containing 2,753 paraphrase pairs.
2. **Sampled Quora**: A paraphrase corpus containing 20,000 paraphrased question pairs.
3. **PAN**: A paraphrase corpus containing 5,000 paraphrase pairs.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MRPC**, the citation is:
  > Dolan et al., 2004. Unsupervised construction of large paraphrase corpora: Exploiting massively parallel news sources. In COLING.

- For **Sampled Quora**, the citation is:
  > Iyer et al., 2017. First Quora dataset release: Question pairs.

- For **PAN**, the citation is:
  > Madnani et al., 2012. Re-examining machine translation metrics for paraphrase identification. In NAACL.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
