To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HIT-SCIR at MRP 2019: A Unified Pipeline for Meaning Representation Parsing via Efficient Training and Effective Encoding" by Wanxiang Che, Longxu Dou, Yang Xu, Yuxuan Wang, Yijia Liu, and Ting Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the semantic graphbanks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing semantic graphbanks and the importance of developing a unified parsing system. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MRP dataset**: This dataset is used for cross-framework semantic parsing task.
2. **SDP dataset**: This dataset is used for semantic dependency parsing.
3. **EDS dataset**: This dataset is used for semantic dependency parsing.
4. **UCCA dataset**: This dataset is used for semantic dependency parsing.
5. **AMR dataset**: This dataset is used for semantic dependency parsing.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MRP dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **SDP dataset**, the citation is:
  > Oepen et al. (2015)

- For **EDS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Flickinger et al. (2017)

- For **UCCA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Abend and Rappoport (2013)

- For **AMR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Banarescu et al. (2013)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
