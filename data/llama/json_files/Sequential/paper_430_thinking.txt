To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Feasibility of Embedding Based Automatic Evaluation for SingleDocument Summarization" by Simeng Sun and Ani Nenkova, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of distributed representations for evaluating summarizers, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of ROUGE and the importance of exploring alternative evaluation metrics. They hint at the use of various datasets for evaluating summarization systems.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **DUC2001 and DUC2002**: These datasets are used for evaluating summarization systems.
2. **Newsroom**: This dataset is used for evaluating summarization systems.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluating summarization systems.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DUC2001 and DUC2002**, the citations are:
  > Lin, C. Y. (2004). ROUGE: A package for automatic evaluation of summaries. In Proceedings of the ACL workshop on Text Summarization Branches Out, page 10.
  > Zhou et al. (2006). ParaEval: Using paraphrases to evaluate summaries automatically. In Proceedings of the Human Language Technology Conference of the NAACL, Main Conference, pages 447-454, New York City, USA.
- For **Newsroom**, the citation is:
  > Grusky et al. (2018). Newsroom: A dataset of 1.3 million summaries with diverse extractive strategies. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 708-719.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
