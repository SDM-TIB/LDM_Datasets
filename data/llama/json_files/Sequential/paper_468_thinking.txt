To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NLP@UNED at SMM4H 2019: Neural Networks Applied to Automatic Classifications of Adverse Effects Mentions in Tweets" by Javier Cortes-Tejada, Juan Martinez-Romo, and Lourdes Araujo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the biomedical domain, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of word2vec and the importance of character-based representations like fastText. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following dataset:

1. **Twitter dataset**: This dataset contains 24606 tweets manually tagged, being around 10% (2358) of tweets mentioning Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR), and around the remaining 90% (22248) are tweets without ADRs.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that this dataset was used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces its relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for this dataset:

- For the **Twitter dataset**, the citation is:
  > Davy Weissenbacher, Abeed Sarker, Arjun Magge, Ashlynn Daughton, Karen O'Connor, Michael Paul, and Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez. *Overview of the fourth Social Media Mining for Health In Proceedings of the fourth Social Media Mining for Health Applications (#SMM4H) Workshop & Shared Task, pages 93a95 Florence, Italy, August 2, 2019. c2019 Association for Computational Linguistics*

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
