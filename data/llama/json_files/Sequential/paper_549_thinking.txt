To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Figure Eight at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Ensemble of Transfer Learning Methods for Contextual Emotion Detection" by Joan Xiao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the task of contextual emotion detection, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the task of contextual emotion detection and mention the use of pre-trained language models (ULMFiT, OpenAIGPT, and BERT) and fine-tuning them on the task.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SemEval-2019 Task 3 dataset**: This dataset is used for contextual emotion detection.
2. **SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and emotional state inference.
3. **SemEval-2017 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis.
4. **SemEval-2016 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis.
5. **SemEval-2014 Task 9: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SemEval-2019 Task 3 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ankush Chatterjee, Kedhar Nath Narahari, Meghana Joshi, and Puneet Agrawal. *Semeval-2019 task 3: Emocontext: Contextual emotion detection*. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), pages 220a224, 2019.

- For **SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets dataset**, the citation is:
  > Saif M Mohammad, Felipe Bravo-Marquez, Mohammad Salameh, and Svetlana Kiritchenko. 2018. SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets. Technical report.

- For **SemEval-2017 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sara Rosenthal, Noura Farra, and Preslav Nakov. 2017. SemEval-2017 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. Technical report.

- For **SemEval-2016 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter dataset**, the citation is:
  > Preslav Nakov, Alan Ritter, Sara Rosenthal, Fabrizio Sebastiani, and Veselin Stoyanov. 2016. SemEval-2016 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. Technical report.

- For **SemEval-2014 Task 9: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sara Rosenthal, Saif M Mohammad, Preslav Nakov, Alan Ritter, Svetlana Kiritchenko, and Veselin Stoyanov. 2014. Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. Technical report.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
