To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Embedding from Subword-aware Language Models (ESuLMo)" by Jiangtong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of four benchmark NLP tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of ELMo and the importance of subword information for word representation. They hint at the evaluation of their model on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **One Billion Word dataset (Chelba et al., 2013)**
2. **PTB-SD 3.5.0**
3. **PDTB2.0**
4. **SNLI corpus (Bowman et al., 2015)**
5. **ConLL 2009**
6. **CoNLL 2009**
7. **JNLPBA corpus**
8. **CHEMDNER corpus**
9. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**
10. **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task**

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **One Billion Word dataset**, the citation is:

- For **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**, the citation is:
  > L. Smith, L. K. Tanabe, R. J. Ando, C. J. Kuo, I. F. Chung, C. N. Hsu, Y. S. Lin, R. Klinger, C. M. Friedrich, K. Ganchev, et al. *Overview of biocreative ii gene mention recognition*. Genome biology, 9(Suppl 2):1–19, 2008.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
