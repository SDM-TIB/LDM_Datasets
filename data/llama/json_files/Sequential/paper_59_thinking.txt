To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Word-level Textual Adversarial Attacking as Combinatorial Optimization" by Yuan Zang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed attack model on three benchmark datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of textual adversarial attacking and the need for a novel attack model.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named datasets:

1. **IMDB**: A binary sentiment classification dataset.
2. **SST-2**: A binary sentiment classification dataset with a shorter average sentence length.
3. **SNLI**: A natural language inference dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the proposed attack model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **IMDB**, the citation is:
  > Maas et al. (2011) Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis.

- For **SST-2**, the citation is:
  > Socher et al. (2013) Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank.

- For **SNLI**, the citation is:
  > Bowman et al. (2015) A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
