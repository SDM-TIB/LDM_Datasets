To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relating Simple Sentence Representations in Deep Neural Networks and the Brain" by Sharmistha Jat, Hao Tang, Partha Talukdar, and Tom Mitchell, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of MEG brain recording data and a simple sentence corpus.

In the **introduction**, the authors describe the MEG dataset and the simple sentence corpus used in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **MEG Dataset**: This dataset is used for brain activity recordings.
2. **Simple Sentence Corpus (SSC)**: This corpus is used for training deep neural network models.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MEG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Raidi, 2014

- For **Simple Sentence Corpus (SSC)**, the citation is:
  > Talukdar et al., 2012

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
