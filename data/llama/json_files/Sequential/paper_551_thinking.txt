To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STUFIIT at SemEval-2019 Task 5: Multilingual Hate Speech Detection on Twitter with MUSE and ELMo Embeddings" by Michal Bojkovsk and others, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of multilingual hate speech detection models on Twitter, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of hate speech detection and the need for automated detection, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, particularly the part that describes the provided dataset:

"The provided dataset consists of collected messages from Twitter in English or Spanish language. Hate speech datasets are very prone to class im-balances (Schmidt and Wiegand, 2017). The provided dataset does not suffer from this problem."

In the **results section**, the authors describe the dataset:

"The English data contains 10,000 messages with 42.1% of the messages labeled as hate speech. The Spanish data contains 4969 messages and similarly to the English part, 41.5% were labeled as hate speech. This gives us a dataset with 14969 messages of which 6270 are categorized as hate-speech."

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their descriptions from the paper.
