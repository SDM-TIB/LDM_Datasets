To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Sentiment of Polish Language Short Texts" by Aleksander Wawer and Julita Sobiczewska, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of multiple datasets for sentiment analysis, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the goal of using all available Polish language datasets for sentiment analysis. They mention three datasets:

1. **Polish Sentiment Treebank (TW)**
2. **Twitter Data**
3. **Movie Reviews**

In the **materials and methods section**, the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention the three datasets:

1. **Polish Sentiment Treebank (TW)**
2. **Twitter Data**
3. **Movie Reviews**

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Polish Sentiment Treebank (TW)**, the citation is:
  > Radim ERehEuErek and Petr Sojka. 2010. Software Framework for Topic Modelling with Large Corpora. In Proceedings of the LREC 2010 Workshop on New Methods in Text Analytic, pages 1â€“8, 2010.

- For **Twitter Data**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Movie Reviews**, the citation is:
  > Not found

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
