To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Opinion Mining with Deep Contextualized Embeddings" by Wen-Bin Han and Noriko Kando, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of MPQA 1.2 and MOAT datasets for opinion expression detection.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of opinion mining and the use of different deep contextualized embedders.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **MPQA 1.2**: This dataset is used for opinion expression detection.
2. **MOAT**: This dataset is also used for opinion expression detection.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MPQA 1.2**, the citation is:
  > EIrsoy and Cardie (2014)

- For **MOAT**, the citation is:
  > Seki et al. (2008)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
