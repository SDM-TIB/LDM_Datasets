To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NEW STATE-OF-THE-ART FOR DAWNBENCH SQUADA TECHNICAL REPORT" by Felix Wu, Boyi Li, Lequn Wang, Ni Lao, and Kilian Q. Weinberger, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of models on the DAWNBench and SQuAD datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous models and the importance of efficient variants for reading comprehension tasks. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **DAWNBench**: This dataset is used for end-to-end deep learning training and inference.
2. **SQuAD**: This dataset is used for reading comprehension tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DAWNBench**, the citation is:
  > Cody Coleman, Deepak Narayanan, Daniel Kang, Tian Zhao, Jian Zhang, Luigi Nardi, Peter Bailis, Kunle Olukotun, Chris RA, and Matei Zaharia. Dawnbench: An end-to-end deep learning benchmark and competition. NIPS MLSys, 2017.

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. Squad: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. In Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
