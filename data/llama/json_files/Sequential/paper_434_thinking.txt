To extract datasets from the research paper titled "YUN-HPCC at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Multi-Step Ensemble Neural Network for Sentiment Analysis in Textual Conversation" by Dawei Li, Jin Wang and Xuejie Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of Twitter textual conversations for emotion detection, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of emotion detection in textual conversations and the challenges of imbalanced data.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Twitter 200-dimensional word vector**: A pre-trained word vector used for feature extraction.
2. **ELMo word vector**: A word vector trained using the ELMo algorithm.
3. **GloVe word vector**: A word vector trained using the GloVe algorithm.
4. **Development set**: A dataset used for development and testing.
5. **Test set**: A dataset used for testing.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Twitter 200-dimensional word vector**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.
- For **ELMo word vector**, the citation is:
  > Matthew E. Peters, Mark Neumann, Mohit Iyyer, Matt Gardner, Christopher Clark, Kenton Lee, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *Deep contextualized word representations*. The North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics 2019, abs/1802.03867.
- For **GloVe word vector**, the citation is:
  > Jeffrey Pennington, Richard Socher, and Christopher Manning. *GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation*. Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1532â€“1543.
- For **Development set**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.
- For **Test set**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
