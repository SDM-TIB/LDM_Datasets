To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LOOKING FOR ELMOaS FRIENDS: SENTENCE-LEVELPRETRAINING BEYOND LANGUAGE MODELING" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the sentence-level pretraining task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the development of reusable neural network components for sentence understanding and the use of language modeling with methods like ELMo.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **WikiText-103**: A large text dataset used for language modeling.
2. **1 Billion Word Language Model Benchmark (BWB)**: A large text dataset used for language modeling.
3. **WMT14 English-German**: A dataset used for machine translation.
4. **WMT17 English-Russian**: A dataset used for machine translation.
5. **WikiText-103**: A dataset used for sentence-level pretraining.
6. **Reddit**: A dataset used for sentence-level pretraining.
7. **SkipThought**: A dataset used for sentence-level pretraining.
8. **DisSent**: A dataset used for sentence-level pretraining.
9. **GLUE**: A benchmark dataset used for evaluating sentence-level pretraining models.
10. **MSR Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC)**: A dataset used for semantic similarity.
11. **Quora Question Pairs (QQP)**: A dataset used for semantic similarity.
12. **STS-Benchmark (STS)**: A dataset used for semantic similarity.
13. **Multi-Genre NLI Corpus (MNLI)**: A dataset used for natural language inference.
14. **RTE 1, 2, 3, and 5 (RTE)**: A dataset used for natural language inference.
15. **SQuAD (QNLI)**: A dataset used for natural language inference.
16. **Winograd Schema Challenge (WNLI)**: A dataset used for natural language inference.
17. **First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs**: A dataset used for question answering.
18. **CCGBank**: A dataset used for part-of-speech tagging.
19. **Penn Treebank**: A dataset used for part-of-speech tagging.
20. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: A dataset used for gene recognition.
21. **JNLPBA corpus**: A dataset used for protein annotation.
22. **CHEMDNER corpus**: A dataset used for chemical annotation.
23. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: A dataset used for gene recognition.
24. **JNLPBA corpus**: A dataset used for protein annotation.
25. **CHEMDNER corpus**: A dataset used for chemical annotation.
