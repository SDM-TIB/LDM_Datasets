To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NCUEE at MEDIQA 2019: Medical Text Inference Using Ensemble BERT-BiLSTM-Attention Model" by Lung-Hao Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the MEDIQA challenge and the use of the MedNLI dataset.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the MEDIQA challenge and the MedNLI dataset, which is annotated by doctors and grounded in patients' medical histories.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MedNLI dataset**: This dataset is used for natural language inference tasks in the clinical domain.
2. **SNLI dataset**: This dataset is used as a benchmark for NLI system evaluations.
3. **BioBERT dataset**: This dataset is used for biomedical text mining tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MedNLI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Romanov and Shivade, 2018

- For **SNLI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bowman et al., 2015

- For **BioBERT dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lee et al., 2019

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
