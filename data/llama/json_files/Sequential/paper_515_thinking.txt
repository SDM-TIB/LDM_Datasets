To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fermi at SemEval-2019 Task 6: Identifying and Categorizing OffensiveLanguage in Social Media using Sentence Embeddings" by Vijayasaradhi Indurthi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of multiple sentence embeddings in conjunction with various supervised machine learning algorithms, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of identifying and categorizing offensive language in social media, which implies the use of datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **OffensEval dataset**: This dataset is used for the task of identifying and categorizing offensive language in social media.
2. **Hate Speech Detection dataset**: This dataset is used for the task of detecting hate speech in social media.
3. **TRAC dataset**: This dataset is used for the task of identifying and categorizing trolling, aggression, and cyberbullying in social media.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **OffensEval**, the citation is:
  > Zampieri, M., Malmasi, S., Nakov, P., Rosenthal, S., Farra, N., & Kumar, R. (2019). Predicting the type and target of offensive posts in social media. In Proceedings of NAACL.

- For **Hate Speech Detection**, the citation is:
  > Davidson, T., Warmsley, D., Macy, M., & Weber, I. (2017). Automated Hate Speech Detection and the Problem of Offensive Language. In Proceedings of ICWSM.

- For **TRAC**, the citation is:
  > Kumar, R., Ojha, A. K., Malmasi, S., & Zampieri, M. (2018). Benchmarking Aggression Identification in Social Media. In Proceedings of the First Workshop on Trolling, Aggression and Cyber-bulling (TRAC).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
