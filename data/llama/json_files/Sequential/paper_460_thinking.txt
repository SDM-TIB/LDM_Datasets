        To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UNH at SemEval-2019 Task 12: Toponym Resolution in Scientiic Papers" by Matthew Magnusson and Laura Dietz, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the SemEval-2019 Task 12, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the parsing of geographic locations from unstructured text, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Gold Standard Corpus**: A gold standard corpus, composed of 150 full-text journal articles in open access from PubMedCentral (PMC).
2. **GeoNames**: A gazetteer of geographic names and their corresponding geolocations.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Gold Standard Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Weis-senbacher et al. (2017) for the general approach followed by the task organizers for developing the corpus.

- For **GeoNames**, the citation is:
  > https://www.geonames.org/export/4

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
