To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2018), pages 1063a1067" by Jiangnan Xia et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the Machine Comprehension using Commonsense Knowledge task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of machine reading comprehension and mention several MRC datasets, including:

1. **Stanford QuestionAnswering Dataset (SQuAD)**
2. **Microsoft MAchine Reading COm-prehension Dataset (MS-MARCO)**

In the **introduction**, the authors also mention the **Machine Comprehension using Commonsense Knowledge task**, which is based on the **Ostermann et al., 2018b** dataset.

In the **materials and methods section**, the authors mention the **Ostermann et al., 2018b** dataset, which is used for the Machine Comprehension using Commonsense Knowledge task.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the **Ostermann et al., 2018b** dataset was used for the Machine Comprehension using Commonsense Knowledge task.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar et al., 2016. SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.05250.

- For **MS-MARCO**, the citation is:
  > Nguyen et al., 2016. MS MARCO: A human-generated machine reading comprehension dataset. arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.09268.

- For **Ostermann et al., 2018b**, the citation is:
  > Ostermann et al., 2018b. Semeval-2018 task 11: Machine comprehension using commonsense knowledge. In Proceedings of Interna-tional Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2018).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
