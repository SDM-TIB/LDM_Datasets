To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training Deeper Neural Machine Translation Modelswith Transparent Attention" by Ankur Bapna, Mia Xu Chen, Orhan Firat, Ankurbpn, miachen, orhanf, yuancao@google.com, Google AI, Yuan Cao, and Yonghui Wu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for machine translation systems, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of current state-of-the-art NMT models and the importance of larger model capacities. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named datasets:

1. **WMTa14 English-German**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks.
2. **WMTa15 Czech-English**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WMTa14 English-German**, the citation is:
  > (no specific citation found)

- For **WMTa15 Czech-English**, the citation is:
  > (no specific citation found)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
