To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TUPA at MRP 2019: A Multi-Task Baseline System" by Daniel Hershcovich and Oir Arviv, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the TUPA system submission to the shared task on Cross-Framework Meaning Representation Parsing (MRP) at the 2019 Conference for Computational Language Learning (CoNLL).

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the TUPA system and its use in the MRP shared task.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **DM (DELPH-IN MRS Bi-Lexical Dependencies)**: A dataset derived from DeepBank, a corpus of hand-corrected parses from LinGO ERG.
2. **PSD (Prague Semantic Dependencies)**: A dataset used for semantic dependency parsing.
3. **EDS (Elementary Dependency Structures)**: A dataset derived from ERG, encoding English Resource Semantics in a variable-free semantic dependency graph.
4. **UCCA (Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation)**: A dataset used for Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation.
5. **AMR (Abstract Meaning Representation)**: A dataset used for Abstract Meaning Representation parsing.
6. **SDP (Semantic Dependency Parsing)**: A dataset used for semantic dependency parsing.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DM**, the citation is:
  > Ivanova et al. (2012) converted from DeepBank (Flickinger et al., 2012), a corpus of hand-corrected parses from LinGO ERG (Copes-take and Flickinger, 2000), an HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994) using Minimal Recursion Semantics (Copestake et al., 2005).

- For **PSD**, the citation is:
  > Hajic et al. (2012) and Miyao et al. (2014).

- For **EDS**, the citation is:
  > Oepen and LA nning (2006).

- For **UCCA**, the citation is:
  > Abend and Rappoport (2013).

- For **AMR**, the citation is:
  > Banarescu et al. (2013).

- For **SDP**, the citation is:
  > Oepen et al. (2014, 2015, 2016).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
