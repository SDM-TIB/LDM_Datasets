To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLaC Lab at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Contextual Emotion Detection Using a Combination of Neural Networks and SVM" by Eham Mohammadi, Hessam Amini and Leila Kosseim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the EmoContext task, which focused on contextual emotion detection in a dataset of 3-round dialogues. For ourinal system, we used a neural network withpretrained ELMo word embeddings and POStags as input, GRUs as hidden units, an atten-tion mechanism to capture representations ofthe dialogues, and an SVM classiier whichused the learned network representations toperform the task of multi-class classiication.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of emotion detection in dialogues, as well as in single utterances.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the EmoContext dataset, which consists of a dataset of 3-round dialogues.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the EmoContext dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the EmoContext dataset:

- For EmoContext, the citation is:
  > Chatterjee et al., 2019b. Semeval-2019 task 3: Emocontext: Contextual emotion detection. In Proceedings of The 13th Interna-tion in text.tional Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. Associationfor Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
