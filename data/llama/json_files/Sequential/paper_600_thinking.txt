To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Customer Feedback Analysis using Machine Learning and Neural Network Approaches" by Prathyusha Danda, Pruthwik Mishra, Silpa Kanneganti, and Soujanya Lanka, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the IJCNLP 2017 shared task on Customer Feedback Analysis, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the IJCNLP 2017 shared task on Customer Feedback Analysis, which focuses on classifying customer feedback into one of a predefined set of categories or classes. They mention that the task uses four languages: English, French, Japanese, and Spanish.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Microsoft Office users' feedback corpus**: This dataset is used for the task.
2. **GermEval 2017 dataset**: This dataset is used for the task.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Microsoft Office users' feedback corpus**, the citation is:
  > Bentley and Batra (2016) dealt with Microsoft Of-ice users feedback, on which they applied var-ious machine learning techniques.

- For **GermEval 2017 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Michael Wojatzki, Eugen Ruppert, Sarah Holschnei-der, Torsten Zesch, and Chris Biemann. 2017. GermEval 2017: Shared task on aspect-based sentiment in social media customer feedback. In Proceedings of the GSCL GermEval Shared Task on Aspect-based Sentiment in Social Media Customer Feedback.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
