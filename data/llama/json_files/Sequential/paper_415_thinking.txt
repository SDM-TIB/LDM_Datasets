To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Code completion using Neural Attention and Byte Pair Encoding" by Youri Arkesteijny, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the SRI labas 150k Python Dataset for prediction task.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of the SRI labas 150k Python Dataset as a basis for their prediction task.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the SRI labas 150k Python Dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the SRI labas 150k Python Dataset was used for evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SRI labas 150k Python Dataset:

- For the SRI labas 150k Python Dataset, the citation is:
  > https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/py150

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
