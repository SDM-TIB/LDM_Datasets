To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Imperial College London Submission to VATEX Video Captioning Task" by Ozan Caglayan, Zixiu Wu, Pranava Madhyastha, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the VATEX dataset and the I3D action features.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the VATEX dataset and its use in the video captioning challenge.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the VATEX dataset:

1. **VATEX dataset**: This dataset is used for video captioning.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the VATEX dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the VATEX dataset:

- For **VATEX dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xin Wang, Jiawei Wu, Junkun Chen, Lei Li, Yuan-Fang Wang, and William Yang Wang. VATEX: A large-scale, high-quality multilingual dataset for video-and-language research. arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.03493, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
