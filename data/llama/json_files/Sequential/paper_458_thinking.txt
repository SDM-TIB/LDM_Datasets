To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep contextualized word representations for detecting sarcasm and irony" by Suzana IliA c1, Edison Marrese-Taylor2, Jorge A. Balazs2, Yutaka Matsuo2, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the testing of the model on 7 different datasets derived from 3 different data sources, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of sarcasm and irony detection and mention that there is no consensus in academic research on the formal definition of these terms.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for testing. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Twitter dataset**: Derived from the SemEval 2018 Task 3, Irony Detection in English Tweets.
2. **Reddit dataset**: Collected by Khodak et al. (2017) and used as SARC 2.0.
3. **Online Dialogues dataset**: Utilized by Oraby et al. (2016) and consists of subsets of the Internet Argument Corpus (IAC).
4. **PtA aEcek dataset**: A user self-annotated corpus of tweets with the #sar-casm hashtag.
5. **Riloff dataset**: Manually annotated for sarcasm.
6. **SC-V1 and SC-V2 datasets**: Subsets of the Internet Argument Corpus (IAC).
7. **SARC 2.0 pol dataset**: A subset of the SARC 2.0 dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for testing the proposed model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Twitter dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cynthia Van Hee, Els Lefever, and Veronique Hoste. 2018. SemEval-2018 Task 3: Irony Detection in English Tweets. Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2018), pages 39a50.

- For **Reddit dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mikhail Khodak, Nikunj Saunshi, and Kiran Vodrahalli. 2017. A Large Self-Annotated Corpus for Sar-casm. 

- For **Online Dialogues dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shereen Oraby, Vrindavan Harrison, Lena Reed, Ernesto Hernandez, Ellen Riloff, and Marilyn Walker. 2016. Creating and Characterizing a Di-verse Corpus of Sarcasm in Dialogue. Proceedings of the 17th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue, (September):31a41.

- For **PtA aEcek dataset**, the citation is:
  > TomA aEs PtA aEcek, Ivan Habernal, and Jun Hong. 2014. Sarcasm Detection on Czech and English Twitter. Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers (COL-ING 2014), Citeseer, pages 213a223.

- For **Riloff dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ellen Riloff, Ashequl Qadir, Prafulla Surve, Lalin-dra De Silva, Nathan Gilbert, and Ruihong Huang. 2013. Sarcasm as Contrast between a Positive Senti-ment and Negative Situation. Emnlp, (Emnlp):704a714.

- For **SC-V1 and SC-V2 datasets**, the citation is:
  > Shereen Oraby, Vrindavan Harrison, Lena Reed, Ernesto Hernandez, Ellen Riloff, and Marilyn Walker. 2016. Creating and Characterizing a Di-verse Corpus of Sarcasm in Dialogue. Proceedings of the 17th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue, (September):31a41.

- For **SARC 2.0 pol dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mikhail Khodak, Nikunj Saunshi, and Kiran Vodrahalli. 2017. A Large Self-Annotated Corpus for Sar-casm.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
