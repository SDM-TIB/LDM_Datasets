To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Team Bertha von Suttner at SemEval-2019 Task 4: Hyperpartisan News Detection using ELMo Sentence Representation Convolutional Network" by Ye Jiang, Johann Petrak, Xingyi Song, Kalina Bontcheva, and Diana Maynard, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the SemEval-2019 Task 4 and the Hyperpartisan News Detection task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenge of hyperpartisan news detection and the need for high-quality datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **by-publisher corpus**: This dataset contains 750K articles which were automatically classified based on a categorization of the political bias of the news source.
2. **by-article corpus**: This dataset contains 645 articles which were labelled manually.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **by-publisher corpus**, the citation is:
  > Johannes Kiesel, Maria Mestre, Rishabh Shukla, Emanuel Vincent, Payam Adineh, David Corney, Benno Stein, and Martin Potthast. *SemEval-2019 Task 4: Hyperpartisan News Detection*. Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2019). Association for Computational Linguistics. 843

- For **by-article corpus**, the citation is:
  > Johannes Kiesel, Maria Mestre, Rishabh Shukla, Emanuel Vincent, Payam Adineh, David Corney, Benno Stein, and Martin Potthast. *SemEval-2019 Task 4: Hyperpartisan News Detection*. Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2019). Association for Computational Linguistics. 843

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
