To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disney at IEST 2018: Predicting Emotions using an Ensemble" by Wojciech Witon, Pierre Colombo, Ashutosh Modi, and Mubbasir Kapadia, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the WASSA 2018 shared task on emotion prediction, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the WASSA 2018 shared task and the importance of emotion prediction in natural language processing. They mention the WASSA corpus, which is used for the task.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the WASSA corpus:

1. **WASSA Corpus**: This dataset is used for the WASSA 2018 shared task on emotion prediction.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the WASSA corpus was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the WASSA corpus:

- For the WASSA corpus, the citation is:
  > Roman Klinger, Orph√©e de Clercq, Saif M. Mohammad, and Alexandra Balahur. *IEST: WASSA-2018 implicit emotions shared task*. In Proceedings of the 9th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis, pages 248-253, 2018. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/P17248

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
