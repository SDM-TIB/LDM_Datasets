To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Semantic Parsers from Denotations with Latent Structured Alignments and Abstract Programs" by Bailin Wang, Ivan Titov and Mirella Lapata, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the semantic parsing task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of semantic parsing and the importance of learning from denotations. They hint at the use of two named datasets:

1. **WIKITABLEQUESTIONS**: A dataset containing 2,018 tables and 18,496 utterance-denotation pairs.
2. **WIKISQL**: A dataset containing 24,241 tables and 80,654 question-answer pairs.

In the **materials and methods section**, the authors mention the use of these two datasets for training and evaluation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WIKITABLEQUESTIONS**, the citation is:
  > Pasupat and Liang (2015) WIKITABLEQUESTIONS: A Benchmarking Dataset for Semantic Parsing

- For **WIKISQL**, the citation is:
  > Zhong et al. (2017) Seq2SQL: Generating Structured Queries from Natural Language

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
