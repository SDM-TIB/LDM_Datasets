To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Attentive Sentence-Pair Modeling via Distilled Sentence Embedding" by Oren Barkan, Noam Razin, Itzik Malkiel, Ori Katz, Avi Caciularu, and Noam Koenigstein, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the Distilled Sentence Embedding (DSE) model on five GLUE sentence-pair tasks.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of cross-attention models and the importance of sentence embedding techniques.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **GLUE benchmark**: This dataset is used for evaluating the DSE model on five sentence-pair tasks.
2. **MNLI**: This dataset is used for evaluating the DSE model on natural language inference tasks.
3. **QQP**: This dataset is used for evaluating the DSE model on question-answering tasks.
4. **QNLI**: This dataset is used for evaluating the DSE model on question-answering tasks.
5. **MRPC**: This dataset is used for evaluating the DSE model on semantic similarity tasks.
6. **STS-B**: This dataset is used for evaluating the DSE model on semantic similarity tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of the DSE model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **GLUE benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Wang et al. (2018) GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding.
- For **MNLI**, the citation is:
  > Williams et al. (2017) A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference.
- For **QQP**, the citation is:
  > Wang et al. (2018) GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding.
- For **QNLI**, the citation is:
  > Wang et al. (2018) GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding.
- For **MRPC**, the citation is:
  > Dolan and Brockett (2005) Automatically constructing a corpus of sentential paraphrases.
- For **STS-B**, the citation is:
  > Cer et al. (2017) SemEval-2017 task 1: Semantic textual similarity multilingual and crosslingual focused evaluation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
