To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2018), pages 1043a1047" by Peng Ding, Xiaobing Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the machine comprehension task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the major challenge of the machine comprehension problem and mention the CNN/DailyMail data sets and the SQuAD data set.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CNN/DailyMail data sets**: This dataset is used for the machine reading comprehension task.
2. **SQuAD data set**: This dataset is used for the machine reading comprehension task.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CNN/DailyMail data sets**, the citation is:
  > Danqi Chen, Jason Bolton, and Christopher D Manning. 2016. Thecnn/daily mail reading comprehension task. In Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), volume 1, pages 2358a2367.

- For **SQuAD data set**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. 2016. Squad: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383a2392.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
