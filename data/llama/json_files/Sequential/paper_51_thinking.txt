To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Learning with Contextual Embeddings for Zero-resource Cross-lingual Classification and NER" by Phillip Keung, Yichao Lu, Vikas Bhardwaj, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of multilingual BERT and various NLP tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of multilingual BERT and its performance on zero-shot and zero-resource cross-lingual settings. They mention the XNLI dataset and the MLDoc and CoNLL 2002/2003 datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **XNLI**: A dataset for cross-lingual natural language inference.
2. **MLDoc**: A dataset for multilingual document classification.
3. **CoNLL 2002/2003**: A dataset for named entity recognition.
4. **German.train.10000**: A dataset for language-adversarial training.
5. **Japanese.train.10000**: A dataset for language-adversarial training.
6. **french.train.10000**: A dataset for language-adversarial training.
7. **ItaRuZh**: A dataset for language-adversarial training.
8. **DeEsFrItJaRuZh**: A dataset for language-adversarial training.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **XNLI**, the citation is:
  > Alexis Conneau, Guillaume Lample, Ruty Rinott, Adina Williams, Samuel R Bowman, Holger Schwenk,and Veselin Stoyanov. *Xnli: Evaluating cross-lingual sentence representations*. Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.

- For **MLDoc**, the citation is:
  > Holger Schwenk and Xian Li. *A corpus for multilingual document classification in eight languages*. In Proceedings of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC).

- For **CoNLL 2002/2003**, the citation is:
  > Erik F Sang and Fien De Meulder. *Introduction to the conll-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL).

- For **German.train.10000**, **Japanese.train.10000**, **french.train.10000**, **ItaRuZh**, and **DeEsFrItJaRuZh**, the citations are:
  > Phillip Keung, Yichao Lu, Vikas Bhardwaj. *Adversarial Learning with Contextual Embeddings for Zero-resource Cross-lingual Classification and NER*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2002raM91.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
