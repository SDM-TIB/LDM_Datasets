To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Syntactic and Semantic Information inWord Embeddings using Graph Convolutional Networks" by Shikhar Vashishth, Manik Bhandari, Piyush Rai, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, and Partha Talukdar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the word embedding task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing word embedding methods and the importance of incorporating syntactic and semantic information. They hint at the evaluation of these methods on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named entity recognition datasets:

1. **CoNLL-2003**: This dataset is used for named entity recognition.
2. **CoNLL-2012**: This dataset is used for coreference resolution.
3. **Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)**: This dataset is used for question answering.
4. **Penn Treebank POS dataset**: This dataset is used for part-of-speech tagging.
5. **MSR**: This dataset is used for word analogy task.
6. **WS353**: This dataset is used for word similarity task.
7. **SimLex-999**: This dataset is used for word similarity task.
8. **RW**: This dataset is used for word similarity task.
9. **AP**: This dataset is used for concept categorization task.
10. **Battig**: This dataset is used for concept categorization task.
11. **BLESS**: This dataset is used for concept categorization task.
12. **ESSLI**: This dataset is used for concept categorization task.
13. **SemEval-2012**: This dataset is used for semantic role labeling.
14. **JNLPBA**: This dataset is used for named entity recognition.
15. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: This dataset is used for gene recognition tasks.
16. **CHEMDNER**: This dataset is used for drug and chemical annotation.
17. **WordNet**: This dataset is used for semantic relations.
18. **PPDB**: This dataset is used for paraphrase ranking.
19. **FrameNet**: This dataset is used for semantic relations.
20. **ELMo**: This dataset is used for contextualized word representations.
21. **Wikipedia2**: This dataset is used for training the models.
22. **LC.sc**: This dataset is used for training the models.
23. **viXra**: This dataset is used for training the models.
