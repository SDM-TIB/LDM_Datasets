To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse Victory a A Large Scale Systematic Comparison of Count-Based and Prediction-Based Vectorizers for Text Classification" by Rupak Chakraborty, Ashima Elhence, and Kapil Arora, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of text vectorization algorithms on a diverse collection of 73 publicly available datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of text vectorization for NLP applications and mention traditional methods for converting text into a fixed length vector.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention that they have collected, curated, and standardized a set of 73 different datasets.

In the **results section**, the authors report the performance of different vectorizers on these datasets.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the 73 datasets, the citation is:
  > Not specified in the paper

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
