To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Role Labeling with Pretrained Language Models for Known and Unknown Predicates" by Daniil Larionov, Artem Shelmanov, Elena Chistova, and Ivan Smirnov, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of FrameBank corpus and PropBank-like corpora for training models for SRL.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of FrameBank corpus and the importance of using PropBank-like corpora.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **FrameBank corpus**: A Russian-language resource that can be used for supervised training of SRL models.
2. **PropBank-like corpus**: A corpus that is similar to FrameNet but has some differences.
3. **FrameBank corpus (Lyashevskaya, 2012; Lyashevskaya and Kashkin, 2015)**: A partially annotated text sample with predicates, arguments, and their semantic roles.
4. **FrameBank corpus (Lyashevskaya, 2012)**: A corpus that contains partially annotated text samples with predicates, arguments, and their semantic roles.
5. **PropBank-like corpus (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002)**: A corpus that is similar to FrameNet but has some differences.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **FrameBank corpus**, the citation is:
  > Olga Lyashevskaya. 2012. Dictionary of valencies meets corpus annotation: a case of russian frame-bank. In Proceedings of the 15th EURALEX International Congress, volume 15.

- For **PropBank-like corpus**, the citation is:
  > Piotr Bojanowski, Edouard Grave, Armand Joulin, and Tomas Mikolov. 2017. Enriching word vectors with subword information. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 5:135-146.

- For **FrameBank corpus (Lyashevskaya, 2012)**, the citation is:
  > Olga Lyashevskaya. 2012. Dictionary of valencies meets corpus annotation: a case of russian frame-bank. In Proceedings of the 15th EURALEX International Congress, volume 15.

- For **PropBank-like corpus (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002)**, the citation is:
  > Paul Kingsbury and Martha Palmer. 2002. From treebank to propbank. In LREC, pages 1989-1993.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
