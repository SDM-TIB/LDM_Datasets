To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation of vector embedding models in clustering of text documents" by Tomasz Walkowiak and Mateusz Gniewkowski, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of word embedding models on two corpora of text documents in Polish, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of clustering text documents in Polish and the need for evaluation of word embedding models. They mention that some works studied the quality of word2vec models for Polish, but they focus on single words, not on an application of the word embeddings to represent whole documents for a clustering purpose.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two corpora:

1. **P ress**: A corpus of Polish press news, comprising 6,500 documents, assigned to subject groups.
2. **Rewievs**: A corpus of reviews of scientific works from 21 different science areas, comprising 10,500 documents.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of clustering models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **P ress**, the citation is:
  > Tomasz Walkowiak and Piotr Malak. *In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence - Volume 2:ICAART*. INSTICC, SciTePress, pages 515a522, 2018.

- For **Rewievs**, the citation is:
  > Joulin et al. (2017) fastText: Improving out-of-vocabulary words suggests that fastText was used on this dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
