To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NSIT@NLP4IF-2019: Propaganda Detection from News Articles using Transfer Learning" by Kartik Aggarwal and Anubhav Sadana, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various datasets for propaganda detection, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of propaganda detection and the use of fine-grained analysis of propaganda in news articles. They hint at the use of datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named datasets:

1. **SLC Task dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the propaganda detection models.
2. **News articles dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the propaganda detection models.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SLC Task dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kartik Aggarwal and Anubhav Sadana. *NSIT@NLP4IF-2019: Propaganda Detection from News Articles using Transfer Learning*. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on NLP for Internet Freedom (NLP4IF): Censorship, Disinformation, and Propaganda, pages 143-147, 2019.

- For **News articles dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kartik Aggarwal and Anubhav Sadana. *NSIT@NLP4IF-2019: Propaganda Detection from News Articles using Transfer Learning*. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on NLP for Internet Freedom (NLP4IF): Censorship, Disinformation, and Propaganda, pages 143-147, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
