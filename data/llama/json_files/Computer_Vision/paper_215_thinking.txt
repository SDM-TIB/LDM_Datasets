To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial Transformer for 3D Point Clouds" by Jiayun Wang, Rudrasis Chakraborty, and Stella X. Yu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of ShapeNet part segmentation dataset and SplatNet.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing methods for 3D point cloud processing and propose a novel approach using spatial transformers.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **ShapeNet part segmentation dataset**: This dataset is used for part segmentation tasks.
2. **SplatNet**: This dataset is used for point cloud processing tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ShapeNet part segmentation dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. X. Chang, T. Funkhouser, L. Guibas, P. Hanrahan, Q. Huang, Z. Li, S. Savarese, M. Savva, S. Song, H. Su et al., *Shapenet: An information-rich 3d model repository*, arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

- For **SplatNet**, the citation is:
  > H. Su, V. Jampani, D. Sun, S. Maji, E. Kalogerakis, M.-H. Yang, and J. Kautz, *Splatnet: Sparse lattice networks for point cloud processing*, Proc. Conf. Comput. Vis. Pat. Recog., 2018, pp. 2530â€“2539.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
