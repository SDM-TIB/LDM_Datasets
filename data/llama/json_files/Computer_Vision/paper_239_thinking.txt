To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Localization of Objects in Images with Limited Context" by Deepak Mishra et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of MNIST, Caltech-101, and a synthetic dataset for object matching and registration, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing approaches and the importance of object localization in image registration. They hint at the evaluation of their model on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **MNIST dataset**: A dataset of handwritten digits.
2. **Caltech-101 dataset**: A dataset of images of 101 categories.
3. **US-CT dataset**: A synthetic dataset of ultrasound and CT images.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their model, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, LÃ©on Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 82(4):227a246, 1994.

- For **Caltech-101 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fei-Fei Li, C. Lawrence Zitnick, and William T. Freeman. *Reducing the dimensionality of images for accurate classification*. Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009.

- For **US-CT dataset**, the citation is:
  > J.-L. Dillenseger, S. Laguitton, and A E. Delabrousse. *Fast simulation of ultrasound images from a ct volume*. Computers in biology and medicine, vol. 39, no. 2, pp. 180a186, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
