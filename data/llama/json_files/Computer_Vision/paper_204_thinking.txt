To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InterBERT: Vision-and-Language Interaction for Multi-modal Pretraining" by Junyang Lina, An Yang, Yichang Zhang, Jie Liu, Jingren Zhou, and Hongxia Yang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the vision-and-language interaction, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous multi-modal pretraining methods and the importance of effective interaction between image and text modalities. They hint at the evaluation of their model on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named datasets:

1. **Conceptual Caption (CC)**: This dataset is used for pretraining.
2. **SBU Captions**: This dataset is used for pretraining.
3. **COCO Captions**: This dataset is used for pretraining.
4. **Flickr30K**: This dataset is used for finetuning.
5. **Visual Genome**: This dataset is used for object detection.
6. **TaoMultimodal**: This dataset is used for deployment.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
