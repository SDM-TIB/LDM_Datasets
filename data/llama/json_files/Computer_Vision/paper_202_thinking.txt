To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multistage Model for Robust Face Alignment Using Deep Neural Networks" by Huabin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of several benchmark datasets for face alignment, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of face alignment and the need for robust methods. They mention several datasets used for benchmarking face alignment methods.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named datasets:

1. **300-W**: A widely used dataset for face alignment.
2. **COFW**: A dataset focused on occlusion in nature.
3. **WFLW**: A challenging dataset with rich attribute annotations.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **300-W**, the citation is:
  > C. Sagonas, G. Tzimiropoulos, S. Zafeiriou, and M. Pantic. *300 faces in-the-wild challenge: Database and results*. Image and Vision Computing, vol. 47, pp. 3–18, 2016.

- For **COFW**, the citation is:
  > X. P. Burgos-Artizzu, P. Perona, and P. Dollà. *Robust face landmark estimation under occlusion*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2013, pp. 1513–1520.

- For **WFLW**, the citation is:
  > W. Wu, C. Qian, S. Yang, Q. Wang, Y. Cai, and Q. Zhou. *Look at boundary: A boundary-aware face alignment algorithm*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2018, pp. 2129–2138.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
