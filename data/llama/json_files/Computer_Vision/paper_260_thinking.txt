To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2018), pages 868a873" by Krishna Madgula, Snehanshu Saha, and Manikandan R., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of MalwareTextDB corpus for malware text analysis, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of MalwareTextDB corpus for malware text analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention MalwareTextDB corpus:

1. **MalwareTextDB**: This dataset is used for malware text analysis.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that MalwareTextDB corpus was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for MalwareTextDB:

- For **MalwareTextDB**, the citation is:
  > Swee Kiat Lim, Aldrian Obaja Muis, Wei Lu, and Ong Chen Hui. *Malwaretextdb: A database for annotated malware articles*. In ACL.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
