To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probing the phonetic and phonological knowledge of tones in Mandarin TTS models" by Jian Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of controlled stimuli for testing tonal coarticulation and tone sandhi in Mandarin, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of TTS models in capturing linguistic phenomena, particularly tone sandhi rules in Mandarin. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Chinese Standard Mandarin Speech Corpus (CSMSC)**: This dataset is used for training and testing the TTS models.
2. **Stimuli for Tonal Coarticulation**: This dataset contains 576 bisyllabic combinations of syllables with different tones embedded in 6 carrier phrases.
3. **Stimuli for Tone-3 Sandhi**: This dataset contains 38 bisyllabic words, 32 trisyllabic words, and 39 phrases that range from 4 to 19 characters, all in Tone-3.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CSMSC**, the citation is:
  > https://www.data-baker.com/open-source.html

- For **Stimuli for Tonal Coarticulation**, the citation is:
  > Table 1: Onset and offset of Mandarin tones

- For **Stimuli for Tone-3 Sandhi**, the citation is:
  > Table 1: Onset and offset of Mandarin tones

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
