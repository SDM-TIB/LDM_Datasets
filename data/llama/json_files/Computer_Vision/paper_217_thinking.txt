To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classiication based Grasp Detection using Spatial Transformer Network" by Dongwon Park and Se Young Chun, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the Cornell grasp detection dataset.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the robotic grasp detection task and mention the use of machine learning approaches for grasp detection.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the Cornell grasp detection dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the Cornell grasp detection dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Cornell grasp detection dataset:

- For the Cornell grasp detection dataset, the citation is:
  > I. Lenz, H. Lee, and A. Saxena, *Deep learning for detecting robotic grasps*, The International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 34, no. 4-5, pp. 705â€“724, Apr. 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
