To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Regression Architecture with Two-Stage Re-initialization for High Performance Facial Landmark Detection" by Jiangjing Lv, Xiaohu Shao, Junliang Xing, Cheng Cheng, and Xi Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the facial landmark detection task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing approaches for facial landmark detection and the importance of initialization in this task. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **300-W dataset**: This dataset is used for facial landmark detection tasks.
2. **AFLW dataset**: This dataset is used for facial landmark detection tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **300-W dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Sagonas, G. Tzimiropoulos, S. Zafeiriou, and M. Pantic. 300 faces in-the-wild challenge: The irst facial landmark localization challenge. In Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, 2013.

- For **AFLW dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Koestinger, P. Wohlhart, P. M. Roth, and H. Bischof. Annotated facial landmarks in the wild: A large-scale, real-world database for facial landmark localization. In Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
