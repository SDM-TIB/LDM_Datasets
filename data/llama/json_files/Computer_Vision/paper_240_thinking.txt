To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VisualBERT: A SIMPLE AND PERFORMANT BASELINE FOR VISION AND LANGUAGE" by Liunian Harold Lia, Mark Yatskara, Da Yina, Cho-Jui Hsieha & Kai-Wei Changa, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the vision-and-language tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous models and the importance of joint contextualized representations for vision and language. They hint at the evaluation of their model on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **COCO (Chen et al., 2015)**: A large-scale object detection dataset.
2. **VQA 2.0 (Goyal et al., 2017)**: A visual question answering dataset.
3. **VCR (Zellers et al., 2019)**: A visual commonsense reasoning dataset.
4. **NLVR2 (Suhr et al., 2019)**: A natural language for visual reasoning dataset.
5. **Flickr30K**: A dataset for region-to-phrase grounding.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their model, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Xinlei Chen, Hao Fang, Tsung-Yi Lin, Ramakrishna Vedantam, Saurabh Gupta, Piotr DollA ar, and C Lawrence Zitnick. Microsoft COCO captions: Data collection and evaluation server. arXivpreprint arXiv:1504.00325, 2015.

- For **VQA 2.0**, the citation is:
  > Yash Goyal, Tejas Khot, Douglas Summers-Stay, Dhruv Batra, and Devi Parikh. Making the V inVQA matter: Elevating the role of image understanding in Visual Question Answering. In CVPR,2017.

- For **VCR**, the citation is:
  > Rowan Zellers, Yonatan Bisk, Ali Farhadi, and Yejin Choi. From recognition to cognition: Visualcommonsense reasoning. In CVPR, 2019.

- For **NLVR2**, the citation is:
  > Alane Suhr, Stephanie Zhou, Iris Zhang, Huajun Bai, and Yoav Artzi. A corpus for reasoning aboutnatural language grounded in photographs. ACL, 2019.

- For **Flickr30K**, the citation is:
  > Bryan A Plummer, Liwei Wang, Chris M Cervantes, Juan C Caicedo, Julia Hockenmaier, and Svet-lana Lazebnik. Flickr30k entities: Collecting region-to-phrase correspondences for richer image-to-sentence models. In ICCV, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
