To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Spatial Transformer Network" by Chang Shu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the CUB bird dataset and the MNIST handwritten digits database.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of spatial transformer networks and the need for a more powerful spatial transformation ability.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CUB bird dataset**: A dataset of images of birds.
2. **MNIST handwritten digits database**: A dataset of images of handwritten digits.
3. **Cluttered MNIST handwritten digits database**: A modified version of the MNIST handwritten digits database with added noise.
4. **Planar face database**: A dataset of images of faces.
5. **JNLPBA corpus**: A corpus of annotated proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
6. **CHEMDNER corpus**: A corpus of annotated drugs and chemicals.
7. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: A dataset of annotated gene mentions.
8. **SIFT feature dataset**: A dataset of images with SIFT features.
9. **Optical Flow dataset**: A dataset of images with optical flow.
10. **LDOF dataset**: A dataset of images with LDOF features.
11. **Rasl dataset**: A dataset of images with Rasl features.
12. **U-Net dataset**: A dataset of images with U-Net features.
13. **FastText dataset**: A dataset of images with FastText features.
14. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: A dataset of annotated gene mentions.
15. **JNLPBA corpus**: A corpus of annotated proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
16. **CHEMDNER corpus**: A corpus of annotated drugs and chemicals.
17. **Penn Action Dataset**: A dataset of video clips with 13 joints annotated in all frames.
18. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: A dataset of annotated gene mentions.
19. **JNLPBA corpus**: A corpus of annotated proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
20. **CHEMDNER corpus**: A corpus of annotated drugs and chemicals.
