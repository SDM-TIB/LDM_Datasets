To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Composite Shape Modeling via Latent Space Factorization" by Anastasia Dubrovina, Fei Xia, RaphaÃ«l el Goresy, Panos Achlioptas, Leonidas Guibas, and Mira Shalah, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the 3D shape domain, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing shape modeling approaches and the importance of structure-aware 3D shape modeling. They hint at the evaluation of their method on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named datasets:

1. **ShapeNet 3D data collection**: This dataset is used for 3D shape modeling and analysis.
2. **Part annotations produced by Yi et al.**: This dataset is used for part-based shape modeling.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their method, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ShapeNet 3D data collection**, the citation is:
  > Angel X Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Mengyan Yan, Hao Su, Cewu Lu, Qixing Huang, Alla Sheffer, Leonidas Guibas, et al. *Shapenet: An information-rich 3d model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

- For **Part annotations produced by Yi et al.**, the citation is:
  > Li Yi, Vladimir G Kim, Duygu Ceylan, I Shen, Mengyan Yan, Hao Su, Cewu Lu, Qixing Huang, Alla Sheffer, Leonidas Guibas, et al. *A scalable active framework for region annotation in 3d shape collections*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 35(6):210, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
