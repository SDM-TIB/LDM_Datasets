To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Transformer with Multi-View Visual Representation for Image Captioning" by Jun Yu, Jing Li, Zhou Yu, and Qingming Huang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for image captioning, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing image captioning approaches and the importance of modeling intra- and inter-modal interactions. They hint at the evaluation of their model on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named datasets:

1. **MSCOCO image captioning dataset**: This dataset is used for image captioning tasks.
2. **Visual Genome dataset**: This dataset is used for visual question answering and object detection tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MSCOCO image captioning dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karpathy, A., Li, F., & Toderici, A. (2015). Large scale image caption generation from visual features of a convolutional neural network. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) (pp. 2956-2965).

- For **Visual Genome dataset**, the citation is:
  > Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J.,... & Shamma, D. A. (2017). Visual genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 123(1), 32-73. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10851-016-0775-4

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
