To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KDEHatEval at SemEval-2019 Task 5: A Neural Network Model for Detecting Hate Speech in Twitter" by Umme Aymun Siddiqua, Abu Nowshed Chy, and Masaki Aono, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the hate speech detection task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of detecting hate speech on Twitter and mention the multilingual detection of hate speech (HatEval) task 5 at SemEval-2019.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named datasets:

1. **HatEval-2019 dataset**: This dataset is used for multilingual detection of hate speech.
2. **SemEval-2019 Task 5 dataset**: This dataset is used for hate speech detection task.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **HatEval-2019 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Basile et al. (2019) propose a multilingual detection of hate speech (HatEval) in twitter, task 5 at SemEval-2019.

- For **SemEval-2019 Task 5 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Basile et al. (2019) propose a multilingual detection of hate speech (HatEval) in twitter, task 5 at SemEval-2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
