To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing One-Shot Grasp Detection based on Robustness Classifier" by Alexandre Gari, Jean-Christophe Ruel, Brahim Chaib-draa and Philippe Giguère, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the Dex-Net 2.0 dataset and the Cornell Grasping Dataset (CGD).

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of grasping and the limitations of previous approaches. They also mention the Dex-Net 2.0 dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Dex-Net 2.0**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the proposed GQ-STN architecture.
2. **Cornell Grasping Dataset (CGD)**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the proposed GQ-STN architecture.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Dex-Net 2.0**, the citation is:
  > J. Mahler, J. Liang, S. Niyaz, M. Laskey, R. Doan, X. Liu, J. A. Ojea, and K. Goldberg. *Dex-Net 2.0: Deep Learning to Plan Robust Grasps with Synthetic Point Clouds and Analytic Grasp Metrics*. In Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pages 3511–3516, 2017.

- For **Cornell Grasping Dataset (CGD)**, the citation is:
  > L. Trottier, P. Giguère, and B. Chaib-Draa. *Sparse dictionary learning for identifying grasp locations*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 168–175, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
