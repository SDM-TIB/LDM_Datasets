To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Patch Matching Using ConvolutionalDescriptors with Euclidean Distance" by Iaroslav Melekhov, Juho Kannala, and Esa Rahtu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the Multi-view Stereo Correspondence (MSC) dataset for training and evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of patch matching in computer vision applications and mention the use of various descriptors, including SIFT and DAISY.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the Multi-view Stereo Correspondence (MSC) dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the MSC dataset was used for training and evaluation of the proposed descriptor.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MSC dataset:

- For **MSC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Iaroslav Melekhov, Juho Kannala, Esa Rahtu. *Patch Matching Using ConvolutionalDescriptors with Euclidean Distance*. arXiv preprint arXiv:7102.00013 (2020).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
