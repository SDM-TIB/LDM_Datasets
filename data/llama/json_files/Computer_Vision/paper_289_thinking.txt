    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FASPell: A Fast, Adaptable, Simple, Powerful Chinese Spell CheckerBased On DAE-Decoder Paradigm" by Yuzhong Hong, Xianguo Yu, Neng He, Nan Liu, Junhui Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the Chinese spell checking task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous Chinese spell checking models and the importance of character-based representations like FASPell. They hint at the evaluation of their model on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named entity recognition corpora:

1. **SIGHAN-13**: This dataset is used for Chinese spell checking tasks.
2. **SIGHAN-14**: This dataset is used for Chinese spell checking tasks.
3. **SIGHAN-15**: This dataset is used for Chinese spell checking tasks.
4. **SIGHAN-13 - 15 shared tasks**: This dataset is used for Chinese spell checking tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their model, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SIGHAN-13**, the citation is:
  > Wu et al. (2013) Chinese spelling check evaluation at SIGHAN bake-off 2013. In Proceedings of the Seventh SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing, pages 35-42, 2013.

- For **SIGHAN-14**, the citation is:
  > Yu et al. (2014) Chinese spelling check evaluation at SIGHAN bake-off 2014. In Proceedings of the Eighth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing, pages 29-36, 2014.

- For **SIGHAN-15**, the citation is:
  > Tseng et al. (2015) Chinese spelling check evaluation at SIGHAN bake-off 2015. In Proceedings of the Ninth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing, pages 32-39, 2015.

- For **SIGHAN-13 - 15 shared tasks**, the citation is:
  > Fung et al. (2017) NLPTEA 2017 shared task a Chinese spelling check. In Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Natural Language Processing Techniques for Educational Applications (NLPTEA 2017), pages 29-34, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
