To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A single Neural Network for Text Detection and Text Recognition" by Christian Bartz, Haojin Yang, and Christoph Meinel, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of models for scene text recognition, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing systems for scene text recognition and the importance of developing a single neural network that can detect and recognize text in a semi-supervised way. They hint at the evaluation of their model on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SVHN dataset**: A large-scale image dataset for scene text recognition.
2. **ICDAR 2013 robust reading benchmark**: A dataset for robust reading recognition.
3. **Street View Text (SVT) dataset**: A dataset for scene text recognition.
4. **IIIT5K robust reading benchmark**: A dataset for robust reading recognition.
5. **French Street Name Signs (FSNS) dataset**: A dataset for scene text recognition.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SVHN dataset**, the citation is:
  > Netzer et al. (2011) Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, volume 2011, page 5, 2011.

- For **ICDAR 2013 robust reading benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Karatzas et al. (2013) Icdar 2013 robust reading competition. In 2013 12th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, pages 1484a1493. IEEE, 2013.

- For **Street View Text (SVT) dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang et al. (2011) End-to-end scene text recognition. In 2011 International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 1457a1464, 2011.

- For **IIIT5K robust reading benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Mishra et al. (2012) Scene text recognition using higher order language priors. In BMVC 2012-23rdBritish Machine Vision Conference, pages 127.1a127.11. British Machine Vision Association, 2012.

- For **French Street Name Signs (FSNS) dataset**, the citation is:
  > Smith et al. (2016) End-to-end interpretation of the French street name signs dataset. In Computer Vision - ECCV2016 Workshops, pages 411a426. Springer, Cham, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
