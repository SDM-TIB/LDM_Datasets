To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Study of Spatial Attention Mechanisms in Deep Networks" by Xizhou Zhu, Dazhi Cheng, and others, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the study of spatial attention mechanisms in deep networks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of attention mechanisms in deep neural networks and the need for a better understanding of their effects.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Cityscapes dataset**: A large-scale urban scene understanding dataset.
2. **COCO dataset**: A large-scale object detection dataset.
3. **ImageNet dataset**: A large-scale image classification dataset.
4. **WMT 2014 English-German dataset**: A large-scale machine translation dataset.
5. **CCNet dataset**: A large-scale semantic segmentation dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
