To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Transformer Networks" by Seongjun Yun, Minbyul Jeong, Raehyun Kim, Jaewoo Kang, and Hyunwoo J. Kim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the node classification task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing GNNs and the importance of learning node representations on heterogeneous graphs. They hint at the evaluation of their model on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **DBLP**: A citation network dataset with three types of nodes (papers, authors, conferences) and four types of edges (PA, AP, PC, CP).
2. **ACM**: A citation network dataset with three types of nodes (papers, authors, subject) and four types of edges (PA, AP, PS, SP).
3. **IMDB**: A movie dataset with three types of nodes (movies, actors, directors) and no edge types mentioned.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their model, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DBLP**, the citation is:
  > R. v. d. Berg, T. N. Kipf, and M. Welling. Graph convolutional matrix completion. arXivpreprint arXiv:1706.02263, 2017.

- For **ACM**, the citation is:
  > R. Kim, C. H. So, M. Jeong, S. Lee, J. Kim, and J. Kang. Hats: A hierarchical graph attention network for stock movement prediction, 2019.

- For **IMDB**, the citation is:
  > X. Wang, X. He, Y. Cao, M. Liu, and T.-S. Chua. Kgat: Knowledge graph attention network for recommendation. In Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining (KDD), pages 950a958, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
