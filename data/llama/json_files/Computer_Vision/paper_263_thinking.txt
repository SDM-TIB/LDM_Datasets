To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vector Quantized Autoencoders and the Hard EM Algorithm" by Aurko Roy, Ashish Vaswani, Arvind Neelakantan, and Niki Parmar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the training and evaluation of VQ-VAE on various datasets, including CIFAR-10.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of continuous latent variable models and the potential of discrete latent variable models. They mention the use of VQ-VAE on datasets such as CIFAR-10.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **WMT English-German**: A dataset of English-German translations.
3. **WMT English-French**: A dataset of English-French translations.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., & Hinton, G. E. (2012). ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) (pp. 1097-1105).

- For **WMT English-German**, the citation is:
  > Sutskever, I., Vinyals, O., & Le, Q. V. (2014). Sequence to sequence learning with neural networks. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) (pp. 3101-3111).

- For **WMT English-French**, the citation is:
  > Sutskever, I., Vinyals, O., & Le, Q. V. (2014). Sequence to sequence learning with neural networks. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) (pp. 3101-3111).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
