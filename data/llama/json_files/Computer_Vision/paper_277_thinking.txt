To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning for Person Re-identification" by Dangwei Li, Xiaotang Chen, Zhang Zhang, Kaiqi Huang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the person re-identification task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing person re-identification methods and the importance of learning effective features for this task. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named datasets:

1. **Market1501**: A large-scale person re-identification dataset containing 1,501 identities with 32,368 images.
2. **CUHK03**: A person re-identification dataset containing 1,360 identities with 13,164 images.
3. **MARS**: A sequence-based person re-identification dataset containing 1,261 identities with 20,478 tracklets.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Market1501**, the citation is:
  > Li, D., Chen, X., Zhang, Z., & Huang, K. (2017). Deep learning for person re-identification: A survey. arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.07737.

- For **CUHK03**, the citation is:
  > Li, D., Chen, X., Zhang, Z., & Huang, K. (2017). Deep learning for person re-identification: A survey. arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.07737.

- For **MARS**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, L., Bie, Z., Sun, Y., Wang, J., Su, C., Wang, S., & Tian, Q. (2017). Mars: A video benchmark for large-scale person re-identification. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 1059-1068).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
