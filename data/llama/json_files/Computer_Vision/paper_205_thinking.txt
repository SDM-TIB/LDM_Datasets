To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cycle Text-to-Image GAN with BERT" by Trevor Tsue, Jason Li, and Samir Sen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the CUB-200 dataset for text-to-image generation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the goal of the text-to-image task and mention the CUB-200 dataset as a widely used benchmark.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the CUB-200 dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the CUB-200 dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CUB-200 dataset:

- For **CUB-200**, the citation is:
  > C. Wah, S. Branson, P. Welinder, P. Perona, and S. Belongie. 2011. The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
