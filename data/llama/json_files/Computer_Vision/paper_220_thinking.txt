To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Argumentative Link Prediction using Residual Networks and Multi-Objective Learning" by Andrea Galassi, Marco Lippi, and Paolo Torroni, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the Cornell eRule-making Corpus (CDCP) for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional methods for argumentation mining and the importance of using deep neural networks.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the Cornell eRule-making Corpus (CDCP).

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the CDCP was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CDCP:

- For **CDCP**, the citation is:
  > Joonsuk Park, Cheryl Blake, and Claire Cardie. *Toward machine-assisted participation in eRulemaking: An argumentation model of evaluability*. Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, pages 206-210, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
