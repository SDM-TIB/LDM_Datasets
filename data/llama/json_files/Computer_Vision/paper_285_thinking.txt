To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Semi-Supervised End-to-End Scene Text Recognition" by Christian Bartz and Haojin Yang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the benchmark datasets for scene text recognition, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the task of scene text recognition and mention the standard benchmark datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SVHN dataset**: A large-scale image dataset for scene text recognition.
2. **French Street Name Signs (FSNS) dataset**: A dataset for street name signs recognition.
3. **Generated datasets**: Two custom datasets created from the SVHN dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SVHN dataset**, the citation is:
  > Netzer, Y.; Wang, T.; Coates, A.; Bissacco, A.; Wu, B.; and Ng, A. Y. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In Proceedings of the 26th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2815–2823, 2011. https://doi.org/10.1145/2110098.2110176

- For **FSNS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Smith, R.; Gu, C.; Lee, D.-S.; Hu, H.; Unnikrishnan, R.; Ibarz, J.; Arnoud, S.; and Lin, S. *End-to-end interpretation of the French street name signs dataset*. In Computer Vision - ECCV 2016 Workshops, 411–426, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-60828-8_31

- For **Generated datasets**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned, but it is implied that they are custom datasets created from the SVHN dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
