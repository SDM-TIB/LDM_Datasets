To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Do Neural Language Models Show Preferences for Syntactic Formalisms?" by Artur Kulmizev et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of 13 different languages and their corresponding treebanks.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous studies and the importance of investigating the extent to which neural language models align with different syntactic formalisms.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the use of 13 different languages and their corresponding treebanks:

1. **Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks**: These treebanks are used for training and evaluating the syntactic annotation of 13 languages.
2. **Surface-Syntactic Universal Dependencies (SUD) treebanks**: These treebanks are used for training and evaluating the syntactic annotation of 13 languages, with a focus on surface structure.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **UD treebanks**, the citation is:
  > Nivre et al. (2016) Universal Dependencies v1: A multilingual treebank collection.

- For **SUD treebanks**, the citation is:
  > Gerdes et al. (2018) SUD or surface-syntactic universal dependencies: An annotation scheme near-isomorphic to UD.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
