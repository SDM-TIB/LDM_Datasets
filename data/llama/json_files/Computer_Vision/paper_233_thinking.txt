To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expressive Graph Informer Networks" by Jaak Simm, Adam Arany, Edward De Brouwer, and Yves Moreau, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the graph-based neural networks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing graph-based neural networks and the importance of incorporating route information. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **NMRShiftDB2**: A dataset of 13C NMR spectra for molecules.
2. **ChEMBL**: A dataset of bioactivity data for chemical compounds on human proteins.
3. **Tox21**: A dataset of toxicity prediction data for chemical compounds.
4. **RegN6D3-G1**: A dataset of regular 6-node 3-degree graphs.
5. **RegN6D3-G2**: A dataset of regular 6-node 3-degree graphs.
6. **RegN8D3**: A dataset of regular 8-node 3-degree graphs.
7. **RegN8D4**: A dataset of regular 8-node 4-degree graphs.
8. **RegN8D5**: A dataset of regular 8-node 5-degree graphs.
9. **RegN8D6**: A dataset of regular 8-node 6-degree graphs.
10. **RegN8D7**: A dataset of regular 8-node 7-degree graphs.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **NMRShiftDB2**, the citation is:
  > Jonas and Kuhn, *Rapid prediction of nmr spectral properties with quantified uncertainty*, Journal of cheminformatics, vol. 11, no. 1, pp.1–7, 2019.

- For **ChEMBL**, the citation is:
  > Bento et al., *The chemblbioactivity database: an update*, Nucleic acids research, vol. 42, no. D1, pp. D1083–D1090, 2014.

- For **Tox21**, the citation is:
  > Wu et al., *Moleculenet: a benchmark for molecular machine learning*, Chemical science, vol. 9, no. 2, pp. 513–530, 2018.

- For **RegN6D3-G1**, **RegN6D3-G2**, **RegN8D3**, **RegN8D4**, **RegN8D5**, **RegN8D6**, and **RegN8D7**, the citations are:
  > Maron et al., *Provably powerful graph networks*, Advances in neural information processing systems, 2019, pp. 2153–2164.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
