To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluations (SemEval-2017)", I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of semantic textual similarity, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of semantic textual similarity and the STS task, but no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SemEval-2012**: A dataset used for training and validation.
2. **SemEval-2015**: A dataset used for training and validation.
3. **SemEval-2016**: A dataset used for testing.
4. **SemEval-2017**: A dataset used for testing.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SemEval-2012**, the citation is:
