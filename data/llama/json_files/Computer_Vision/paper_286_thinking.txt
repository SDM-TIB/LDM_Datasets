To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QUASI-RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS" by James Bradbury, Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong & Richard Socher, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the sequential data, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of standard RNNs and the importance of parallelism in sequence modeling, which hints at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named datasets:

1. **IMDb binary sentiment classification task**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification tasks.
2. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: This dataset is used for language modeling tasks.
3. **IWSLT German-English spoken-domain translation task**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **IMDb binary sentiment classification task**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L Maas, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. Multi-dimensional sentiment analysis with learned representations. Technical report, 2011.

- For **Penn Treebank (PTB)**, the citation is:
  > Tomas Mikolov, Martin KaraiA at, LukA as Burget, Jan CernockA y, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. Recurrent neural network based language model. In INTERSPEECH, 2010.

- For **IWSLT German-English spoken-domain translation task**, the citation is:
  > Yonghui Wu, Mike Schuster, Zhifeng Chen, Quoc V Le, Mohammad Norouzi, Wolfgang Macherey,Maxim Krikun, Yuan Cao, Qin Gao, Klaus Macherey, et al. Googleas neural machine trans-arXiv preprintlation system: Bridging the gap between human and machine translation.arXiv:1609.08144, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
