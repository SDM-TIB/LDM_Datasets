To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rotated Word Vector Representations and their Interpretability" by Sungjoon Park and JinYeong Bak, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the word vector models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of word vector representation and the importance of interpretability. They hint at the evaluation of the rotated word vector representations on various tasks, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three word vector datasets:

1. **Wikipedia English articles**: This dataset is used for training the word vector models.
2. **Skip-gram**: This dataset is used for training the skip-gram word vector model.
3. **Glove**: This dataset is used for training the glove word vector model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Wikipedia English articles**, the citation is:
  > https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/20170120/

- For **Skip-gram**, the citation is:
  > Mikolov et al. (2013)

- For **Glove**, the citation is:
  > Pennington et al. (2014)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
