To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Semi-supervised Aspect-term Sentiment Analysis via Transformer" by Xingyi Chenga, Weidi Xu a, Taifeng Wang, Weipeng Huang, Kunlong Chen and Wei Chu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the aspect-term sentiment analysis task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of manual annotation over the aspects and the amount of labeled data, which hints at the existence of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two classical datasets from SemEval 2014 task 4:

1. **REST dataset**: This dataset contains the reviews in the restaurant domain.
2. **LAPTOP dataset**: This dataset contains the reviews of Laptop products.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **REST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maria Pontiki, Dimitris Galanis, John Pavlopoulos, Ion Androutsopoulos, and Harris Papageorgiou, Suresh Manandhar. *Semeval-2014 task 4: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval@COLING 2014, Dublin, Ireland, August 23-24, 2014, pages 27-35.

- For **LAPTOP dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maria Pontiki, Dimitris Galanis, John Pavlopoulos, Ion Androutsopoulos, and Harris Papageorgiou, Suresh Manandhar. *Semeval-2014 task 4: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval@COLING 2014, Dublin, Ireland, August 23-24, 2014, pages 27-35.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
