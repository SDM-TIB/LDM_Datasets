To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Contextual Representations for Suicide Risk Assessment from Internet Forums" by Ashwin Karthik Ambalavanan, Pranjali Dileep Jagtap, Soumya Adhya, Murthy Devarakonda, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the Uni-versity of Maryland Reddit Suicidality Dataset, which was developed using data from Reddit.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of the Uni-versity of Maryland Reddit Suicidality Dataset for the CLPsych 2019 shared task.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the Uni-versity of Maryland Reddit Suicidality Dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the Uni-versity of Maryland Reddit Suicidality Dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for this dataset:

- For the **Uni-versity of Maryland Reddit Suicidality Dataset**, the citation is:
