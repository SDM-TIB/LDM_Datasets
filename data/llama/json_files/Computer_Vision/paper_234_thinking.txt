To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Word embeddings for Russian language: RusVectA orA es, fastText, RDT" by Andrey Kutuzov and Elizaveta Kuzmenko, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of word embeddings for the Russian language, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the evaluation of word embeddings for the Russian language and mention three models: RusVectA orA es, fastText, and RDT.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **RusVectA orA es**: A dataset for word embeddings in Russian language.
2. **fastText**: A dataset for word embeddings in Russian language.
3. **RDT**: A dataset for word embeddings in Russian language.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of word embeddings.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **RusVectA orA es**, the citation is:
  > Andrey Kutuzov and Elizaveta Kuzmenko. Comparing Neural Lexical Models of a Classic National Corpus and a Web Corpus: The Case for Russian, pages 47–58. Springer International Publishing, 2015.

- For **fastText**, the citation is:
  > Piotr Bojanowski, Edouard Grave, Armand Joulin, and Tomas Mikolov. Enriching word vectors with subword information. arXiv:1607.04606, 2016.

- For **RDT**, the citation is:
  > A. Panchenko, D. Ustalov, N. Arefyev, D. Paperno, N. Konstantinova, N. Loukachevitch, and C. Biemann. Human and Machine Judgements for Russian Semantic Relatedness. In AIST 2016, pages 221–235, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
