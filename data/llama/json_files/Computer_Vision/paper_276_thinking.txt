To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weighted Transformer for Neural Machine Translation" by Karim Ahmed, Nitish Shirish Keskar, and Richard Socher, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for neural machine translation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of the Transformer network and the importance of improving its performance. They hint at the evaluation of the proposed Weighted Transformer on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **WMT 2014 English-to-German corpus**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the proposed Weighted Transformer.
2. **WMT 2014 English-to-French corpus**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the proposed Weighted Transformer.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of the proposed Weighted Transformer, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WMT 2014 English-to-German corpus**, the citation is:
  > Karim Ahmed, Nitish Shirish Keskar, and Richard Socher. Weighted Transformer for Neural Machine Translation. arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.03762, 2017.

- For **WMT 2014 English-to-French corpus**, the citation is:
  > Karim Ahmed, Nitish Shirish Keskar, and Richard Socher. Weighted Transformer for Neural Machine Translation. arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.03762, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
