To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension" by Mike Lewis*, Yinhan Liu*, Naman Goyal*, Marjan Ghazvininejad,Abdelrahman Mohamed, Omer Levy, Ves Stoyanov, Luke Zettlemoyer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of BART on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous pre-training methods and the importance of using a wide range of noising schemes during pre-training. They hint at the evaluation of BART on several datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention several named datasets:

1. **GLUE**: A dataset for general language understanding.
2. **SQuAD**: A dataset for question answering.
3. **XSum**: A dataset for summarization.
4. **ConvAI2**: A dataset for conversational dialogue response generation.
5. **CNN/DailyMail**: A dataset for news summarization.
6. **ELI5**: A dataset for abstractive question answering.
7. **WMT Romanian-English**: A dataset for machine translation.
8. **MNLI**: A dataset for natural language inference.
9. **STS-B**: A dataset for sentiment analysis.
10. **MRPC**: A dataset for machine reading comprehension.
11. **CoLA**: A dataset for sentiment analysis.
12. **RACE**: A dataset for reading comprehension.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of BART.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
