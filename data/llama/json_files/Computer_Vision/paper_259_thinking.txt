To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEQUENTIAL LATENT KNOWLEDGE SELECTION FOR KNOWLEDGE-GROUNDED DIALOGUE" by Jaewoo Ahn and Byeongchang Kim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the Wizard of Wikipedia and Holl-E datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of knowledge selection in multi-turn knowledge-grounded dialogue, which implies the use of datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Wizard of Wikipedia**: This dataset is used for knowledge-grounded dialogue evaluation.
2. **Holl-E**: This dataset is used for knowledge-grounded dialogue evaluation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Wizard of Wikipedia**, the citation is:
  > Dinan et al. (2019) propose a Wizard of Wikipedia benchmark for open-domain multi-turn knowledge-based dialogue.

- For **Holl-E**, the citation is:
  > Moghe et al. (2018) propose a Holl-E dataset for knowledge-grounded dialogue evaluation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
