To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Easy Scaling with Micro-Batch Pipeline Parallelism" by Yanping Huang, Youlong Cheng, Ankur Bapna, Orhan Firat, Mia Xu Chen, Dehao Chen, HyoukJoong Lee, Jiquan Ngiam, Quoc V. Le, and Yonghui Wu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the training of large-scale neural networks on two different tasks with distinct network architectures.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of scaling up deep neural networks and the need for efficient model parallelism algorithms.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **ImageNet-2012**: This dataset is used for image classification tasks.
2. **Multilingual Neural Machine Translation corpus**: This dataset is used for multilingual machine translation tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet-2012**, the citation is:
  > Deng et al. (2009) ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In CVPR, pages 1-9, 2009.

- For **Multilingual Neural Machine Translation corpus**, the citation is:
  > Various authors (2019) Massive multilingual neural machine translation in the wild: Findings and challenges. arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.05019, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
