To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One Shot Learning for Deformable Medical Image Registration and Periodic Motion Tracking" by Tobias Fechter and Dimos Baltas, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed algorithm on multiple publicly available 4D datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of deformable image registration and the limitations of deep learning methods. They mention that the proposed algorithm can be used for 3D and 4D datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **DirLab**: A dataset consisting of 10 4D CTs of the thoracic region.
2. **Popi**: A dataset consisting of 6 4D CTs of the thoracic region.
3. **Sunnybrook**: A dataset consisting of 12 cardiac MRI datasets.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the proposed algorithm.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DirLab**, the citation is:
  > R. Castillo et al., aA framework for evaluation of deformable imageregistration spatial accuracy using large landmark point sets,a Physicsin Medicine & Biology, vol. 54, no. 7, p. 1849, 2009.

- For **Popi**, the citation is:
  > J. Vandemeulebroucke, S. Rit, J. Kybic, P. Clarysse, and D. Sarrut,aSpatiotemporal motion estimation for respiratory-correlated imaging ofthe lungs,a Medical physics, vol. 38, no. 1, pp. 166a178, 2011.

- For **Sunnybrook**, the citation is:
  > P. Radau, Y. Lu, K. Connelly, G. Paul, A. Dick, and G. Wright,aEvaluation framework for algorithms segmenting short axis cardiacmri,a The MIDAS Journal-Cardiac MR Left Ventricle SegmentationChallenge, vol. 49, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
