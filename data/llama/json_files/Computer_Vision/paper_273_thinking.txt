To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compressing BERT: Studying the Effects of Weight Pruning on Transfer Learning" by Mitchell A. Gordon & Kevin Duh & Nicholas Andrews, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the BERT model, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of BERT and the importance of model compression, which hints at the evaluation of the model on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **English BERT**: This is the pre-trained BERT model used for evaluation.
2. **General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark**: This is a multi-task benchmark for natural language understanding tasks.
3. **Wikipedia**: This is a large corpus of text used for pre-training the BERT model.
4. **BookCorpus**: This is another large corpus of text used for pre-training the BERT model.
5. **English Wikipedia**: This is a subset of the Wikipedia corpus used for pre-training the BERT model.
6. **BookCorpus**: This is another subset of the BookCorpus used for pre-training the BERT model.
7. **MNLI**: This is a natural language inference task used for evaluation.
8. **QQP**: This is a question-answering task used for evaluation.
9. **NLI**: This is a natural language inference task used for evaluation.
10. **NER**: This is a named entity recognition task used for evaluation.
11. **STS-B**: This is a sentiment analysis task used for evaluation.
12. **RTE**: This is a reading comprehension task used for evaluation.
13. **MRPC**: This is a machine reading comprehension task used for evaluation.
14. **STS-B**: This is a sentiment analysis task used for evaluation.
15. **CoLA**: This is a sentiment analysis task used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **English BERT**, the citation is:
  > Devlin et al., 2018

- For **GLUE benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Wang et al., 2019

- For **Wikipedia**, the citation is:
  > Wikipedia

- For **BookCorpus**, the citation is:
  > BookCorpus

- For **English Wikipedia**, the citation is:
  > Wikipedia

- For **BookCorpus**, the citation is:
  > BookCorpus

- For **MNLI**, the citation is:
  > MNLI

- For **QQP**, the citation is:
  > QQP

- For **NLI**, the citation is:
  > NLI

- For **NER**, the citation is:
  > NER

- For **STS-B**, the citation is:
  > STS-B

- For **RTE**, the citation is:
  > RTE

- For **MRPC**, the citation is:
  > MRPC

- For **STS-B**, the citation is:
  > STS-B

- For **CoLA**, the citation is:
  > CoLA

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
