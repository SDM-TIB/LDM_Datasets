To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LXMERT: Learning Cross-Modality Encoder Representations from Transformers" by Hao Tan and Mohit Bansal, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the single modality of vision and language, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of single-modality backbone models for vision and language, which hints at the evaluation of these models on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named datasets:

1. **VQA**: A visual question answering dataset.
2. **GQA**: A visual question answering dataset.
3. **NLVR2**: A visual reasoning dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **VQA**, the citation is:
  > Stanislaw Antol, Aishwarya Agrawal, Jiasen Lu, Margaret Mitchell, Dhruv Batra, C Lawrence Zitnick, and Devi Parikh. *VQA: Visual Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on computer vision, pages 2425-2433, 2015.

- For **GQA**, the citation is:
  > Drew A Hudson and Christopher D Manning. *GQA: A new dataset for compositional question answering over real-world images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2019.

- For **NLVR2**, the citation is:
  > Alane Suhr, Stephanie Zhou, Iris Zhang, Huajun Bai, and Yoav Artzi. *A corpus for reasoning about natural language grounded in photographs*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
