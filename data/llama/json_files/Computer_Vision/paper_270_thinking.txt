To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Study on the Memory Requirements of Training Neural Networks" by Nimit S. Sohoni, Christopher R. Aberger, Megan Leszczynski, Jian Zhang, and Christopher RA eStanford University, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the training of neural network models on two representative deep learning benchmarks: WideResNet model for image classification and DynamicConv Transformer model for machine translation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the memory requirements of training neural networks and the need to reduce the overall memory usage.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset is used for image classification tasks.
2. **IWSLTa14**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, N. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical report, 2009.

- For **IWSLTa14**, the citation is:
  > Wu, J., et al. (2019). Pay less attention with lightweight and dynamic convolutions. In International Conference on Learning Representation (ICLR), 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
