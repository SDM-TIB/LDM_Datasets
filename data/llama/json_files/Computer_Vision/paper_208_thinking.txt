To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Syntactic and Semantic Information inWord Embeddings using Graph Convolutional Networks" by Shikhar Vashishth et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the word embedding task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing word embedding methods and the importance of incorporating syntactic and semantic information. They hint at the evaluation of these methods on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Wikipedia2 corpus**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the proposed SynGCN and SemGCN models.
2. **Stanford CoreNLP parser**: This dataset is used for dependency parse graph construction.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Wikipedia2 corpus**, the citation is:
  > https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/20180301/

- For **Stanford CoreNLP parser**, the citation is:
  > Manning et al. (2014)
