To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Lane and Road Markings at A Distance with PerspectiveTransformer Layers" by Zhuoping Yu, Xiaozhou Ren, Yuyao Huang, Wei Tian, Junqiao Zhao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the TuSimple and ApolloScape datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing approaches for lane and road marking detection, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **TuSimple**: This dataset is used for lane detection and consists of 3626 training and 2782 testing images.
2. **ApolloScape**: This dataset contains more than 110,000 frames with high-quality pixel-level annotations.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **TuSimple**, the citation is:
  > Xingang Pan, Jianping Shi, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. Spatial as deep: Spatial cnn for trafic scene understanding.2018.

- For **ApolloScape**, the citation is:
  > Xinyu Huang, Xinjing Cheng, Qichuan Geng, Binbin Cao, Dingfu Zhou, Peng Wang, Yuanqing Lin, and Ruigang Yang. The apolloscapedataset for autonomous driving. arXiv: 1803.06184, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
