To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Semantic Role Labeling with Cross-View Training" by Rui Cai and Mirella Lapata, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the semantic role labeling task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of high-quality annotations for semantic role labeling and the importance of semi-supervised learning. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CoNLL-2009 benchmark dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the semantic role labeling task.
2. **1 Billion Word Language Model Benchmark**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the language model.
3. **SougouNews Data2**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the language model.
4. **NEGRA corpus**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the language model.
5. **CoNLL-2009 out-of-domain datasets**: These datasets are used for evaluation of the model on out-of-domain data.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CoNLL-2009 benchmark dataset**, the citation is:
  > The CoNLL-2009 dataset is not explicitly cited in the paper, but it is mentioned as a benchmark for semantic role labeling.

- For **1 Billion Word Language Model Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Chelba et al. (2013) - 1 Billion Word Language Model Benchmark

- For **SougouNews Data2**, the citation is:
  > The SougouNews Data2 dataset is not explicitly cited in the paper, but it is mentioned as a benchmark for language modeling.

- For **NEGRA corpus**, the citation is:
  > The NEGRA corpus is not explicitly cited in the paper, but it is mentioned as a benchmark for language modeling.

- For **CoNLL-2009 out-of-domain datasets**, the citation is:
  > The CoNLL-2009 out-of-domain datasets are not explicitly cited in the paper, but they are mentioned as benchmarks for semantic role labeling on out-of-domain data.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
