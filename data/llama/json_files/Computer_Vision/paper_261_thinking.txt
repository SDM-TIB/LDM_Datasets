To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Injecting Hierarchy with U-Net Transformers" by David Donahue, Vladislav Lialin, and Anna Rumshisky, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the dialogue generation task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of the Transformer architecture and the importance of hierarchical processing in language models. They hint at the evaluation of their model on two named dialogue datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named dialogue datasets:

1. **Cornell Movie Dialogues corpus**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed U-Net Transformer model on conversational dialogue generation tasks.
2. **PersonaChat dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed U-Net Transformer model on conversational dialogue generation tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Cornell Movie Dialogues corpus**, the citation is:
  > Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lee (2011)

- For **PersonaChat dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang et al. (2018)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
