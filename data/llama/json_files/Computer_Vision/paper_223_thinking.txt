To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Perturbation Analysis for Scalable Certified Robustness and Beyond" by Kaidi Xu, Zhouxing Shi, Huan Zhang, Yihan Wang, Kai-Wei Chang, Minlie Huang, Bhavya Kailkhura, Xue Lin, and Cho-Jui Hsieh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the neural networks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of LiRPA-based methods and the importance of generalizing existing LiRPA algorithms to operate on general computational graphs. They hint at the evaluation of these methods on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Tiny ImageNet**: A dataset used for evaluating the robustness of neural networks.
2. **Downscaled ImageNet**: A subset of the ImageNet dataset used for evaluating the robustness of neural networks.
3. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset used for evaluating the robustness of neural networks.
4. **MNIST**: A dataset used for evaluating the robustness of neural networks.
5. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset used for evaluating the robustness of neural networks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their methods, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Chrabaszcz, P., Loshchilov, I., and Hutter, F. A downsampled variant of imagenet as an alternative to the cifar datasets. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.08819, 2017.

- For **Downscaled ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Chrabaszcz, P., Loshchilov, I., and Hutter, F. A downsampled variant of imagenet as an alternative to the cifar datasets. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.08819, 2017.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical Report TR-2009, 2009.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Le, Y. and Yang, X. Tiny imagenet visual recognition challenge. CS 231N, 2015.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical Report TR-2009, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
