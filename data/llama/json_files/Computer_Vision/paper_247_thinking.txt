To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Error correction and extraction in request dialogs" by Stefan Constantin and Alex Waibel, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset, which suggests that it is a dataset used in this paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset and its use in their research.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset:

- For **EPIC-KITCHENS-100**, the citation is:
  > Dima Damen, Hazel Doughty, Giovanni Maria Farinella, Sanja Fidler, Antonino Furnari, Evangelos Kazakos, Davide Moltisanti, Jonathan Munro, Toby Perrett, Will Price, and Michael Wray. *The EPIC-KITCHENS dataset: Collection, challenges and base-lines*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
