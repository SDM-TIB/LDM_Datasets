To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Jointly Aligning Millions of Images with Deep Penalised Reconstruction Congealing" by Roberto Annunziata, Onido, UKroberto.annunziata@onfido.comChristos SagonasOnido, UKchristos.sagonas@onfido.comJacques CaliaBlue Prismjqscali@gmail.com9102tcO41]VC.sc[2v03140.8091:viXraAbstractExtrapolating ine-grained pixel-level correspondencesin a fully unsupervised manner from a large set of mis-aligned images can beneit several computer vision andgraphics problems, e.g. co-segmentation, super-resolution,image edit propagation, structure-from-motion, and 3D re-construction. Several joint image alignment and congealingtechniques have been proposed to tackle this problem, butrobustness to initialisation, ability to scale to large datasets,and alignment accuracy seem to hamper their wide applica-bility. To overcome these limitations, we propose an unsu-pervised joint alignment method leveraging a densely fusedspatial transformer network to estimate the warping pa-rameters for each image and a low-capacity auto-encoderwhose reconstruction error is used as an auxiliary measureof joint alignment. Experimental results on digits from mul-tiple versions of MNIST (i.e., original, perturbed, affNISTand iniMNIST) and faces from LFW, show that our ap-proach is capable of aligning millions of images with highaccuracy and robustness to different levels and types of per-turbation. Moreover, qualitative and quantitative resultssuggest that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both in terms of alignment quality and ro-bustness to initialisation.
