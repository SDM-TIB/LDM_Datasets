To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient and Deep Person Re-Identiication using Multi-Level Similarity" by Yiluan Guo, Ngai-Man Cheung, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the person re-identification task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing methods for person re-identification and the importance of using multi-level similarity.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **CUHK03 detected**: A large dataset containing 13,164 images for 1,360 identities.
2. **CUHK01**: A dataset containing 3884 images of 971 identities.
3. **VIPeR**: A small dataset containing 632 identities.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CUHK03 detected**, the citation is:
  > W. Li, R. Zhao, and X. Wang. Deepreid: Deep ilterpairing neural network for person re-identiication. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2014.

- For **CUHK01**, the citation is:
  > W. Li, R. Zhao, and X. Wang. Human reidentiication with In Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV), November 2012.

- For **VIPeR**, the citation is:
  > D. Gray, S. Brennan, and H. Tao. Evaluating appearancemodels for recognition, reacquisition, and tracking. In IEEE International Workshop on Performance Evaluation for Tracking and Surveillance (PETS), October 2007.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
