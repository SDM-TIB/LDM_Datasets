To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TRANSFORMER-TRANSDUCER:END-TO-END SPEECH RECOGNITION WITH SELF-ATTENTION" by Ching-Feng Yeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the LibriSpeech corpus for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional hybrid systems and the potential of end-to-end approaches for speech recognition.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the LibriSpeech corpus.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the LibriSpeech corpus was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the LibriSpeech corpus:

- For **LibriSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015. https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7288578

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
