To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Learning of Neural Machine Translation Systems" by Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional machine translation systems and the importance of neural machine translation. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks.
2. **IWSLT English-to-Spanish translation task**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task**, the citation is:
  > Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. *Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate*. In Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1479–1490, 2014. http://dx.doi.org/10.3115/v1/j.15.1048

- For **IWSLT English-to-Spanish translation task**, the citation is:
  > Marc-Alexandre Lussier, and Alain K. Dister. *IWSLT 2012 English-Spanish machine translation*. In Proceedings of the 2012 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1–10, 2012. http://dx.doi.org/10.3115/v1/J.11.1036

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
