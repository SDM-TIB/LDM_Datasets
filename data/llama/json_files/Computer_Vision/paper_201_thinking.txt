To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language Modeling with Gated Convolutional Networks" by Yann N. Dauphin, Angela Fan, Michael Auli, and David Grangier, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed approach on two public large-scale language modeling datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of recurrent neural networks and the importance of parallelization in language modeling. They hint at the evaluation of their model on two named datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Google Billion Word dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluation on the Google Billion Word benchmark.
2. **WikiText-103**: This dataset is used for evaluation on the WikiText-103 benchmark.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Google Billion Word dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chelba, Ciprian, Mikolov, Tomas, Schuster, Mike, Ge, Qi, Brants, Thorsten, Koehn, Phillipp, and Robinson, Tony. One billion word benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.3005, 2013.

- For **WikiText-103**, the citation is:
  > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., and Socher, R. Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models. ArXiv e-prints, September 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
