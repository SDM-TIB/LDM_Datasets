To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unified Vision-Language Pre-training for Image Captioning and VQA" by Luowei Zhou, Hamid Palangi, Lei Zhang, Houdong Hu, Jason J. Corso, and Jianfeng Gao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the vision-language tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing pre-trained models and the importance of unified vision-language pre-training. They hint at the evaluation of their model on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named datasets:

1. **COCO Captions**: A large-scale image captioning dataset.
2. **Flickr30k Captions**: A dataset for image captioning.
3. **VQA 2.0**: A visual question answering dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their unified vision-language pre-training model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **COCO Captions**, the citation is:
  > Chen, X.; Fang, H.; Lin, T.-Y.; Vedantam, R.;Gupta, S.; DollA ar, P.; and Zitnick, C. L. *Microsoft cococaptions: Data collection and evaluation server*. arXiv preprintarXiv:1504.00325.

- For **Flickr30k Captions**, the citation is:
  > Young, P.; Lai, A.; Hodosh, M.; and Hocken-maier, J. *From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguis-tics 2:67a78.

- For **VQA 2.0**, the citation is:
  > Goyal, Y.; Khot, T.; Summers-Stay, D.; Batra,D.; and Parikh, D. *Making the v in vqa matter: Elevating the role of image understanding in visual question answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 6904a6913.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
