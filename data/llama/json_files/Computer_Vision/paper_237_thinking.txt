To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Transformer Networks for Semantic Correspondence" by Seungryong Kim, Stephen Lin, Sangryul Jeon, Dongbo Min, and Kwanghoon Sohn, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the semantic correspondence task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of current semantic correspondence techniques and the importance of handling geometric deformations. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **TSS benchmark**: A dataset for semantic correspondence, consisting of 400 image pairs divided into three groups: FG3DCar, JODS, and PASCAL.
2. **PF-WILLOW benchmark**: A dataset for semantic correspondence, consisting of 10 object sub-classes with 10 keypoint annotations for each image.
3. **PF-PASCAL benchmark**: A dataset for semantic correspondence, containing 1,351 image pairs over 20 object categories with PASCAL keypoint annotations.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **TSS benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Taniai et al. (2016) Joint recovery of dense correspondence and cosegmentation in two images. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3456-3465.

- For **PF-WILLOW benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Ham et al. (2016) Proposal iow. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3456-3465.

- For **PF-PASCAL benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Ham et al. (2017) Proposal iow: Semantic correspondences from object proposals. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 39(1), 145-158.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
