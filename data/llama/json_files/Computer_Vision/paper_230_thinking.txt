To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identity-preserving Face Recovery from Stylized Portraits" by Fatemeh Shiri, A Xin Yu, Fatih Porikli, Richard Hartley, and Piotr Koniusz, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the CelebA dataset for training and the CUFSF dataset for testing.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of prior face recovery methods and the importance of identity preservation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and testing. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CelebA**: A large-scale face dataset containing 200,000 images of faces.
2. **CUFSF**: A dataset of sketches of faces.
3. **Synthesized dataset**: A dataset of synthesized images of faces.
4. **Hand-drawn sketches dataset**: A dataset of hand-drawn sketches of faces.
5. **Church outdoor dataset**: A dataset of images of faces in outdoor environments.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and testing their method.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., Tang, X.: Deep learning face attributes in the wild. In: ICCV (2015) 729.

- For **CUFSF**, the citation is:
  > Nejati, H., Sim, T.: A study on recognizing non-artistic facesketches. In: WACV. IEEE (2011) 332.

- For **Synthesized dataset**, the citation is:
  > Huang, X., Belongie, S.: Arbitrary style transfer in real-time with adaptive instance normalization. arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.06868 (2017).

- For **Hand-drawn sketches dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kazemi, H., Iranmanesh, M., Dabouei, A., Soleymani, S., Nasrabadi, N.M.: Facial attributes guided deep sketch-to-photosynthesis. In: Computer Vision Workshops (WACVW), 2018 IEEE Winter Applications of, pp. 1a8. IEEE (2018).

- For **Church outdoor dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, N., Zha, W., Li, J., Gao, X.: Back projection: an effective postprocessing method for gan-based face sketch synthesis. Pattern Recognition Letters 107, 59a65 (2018).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
