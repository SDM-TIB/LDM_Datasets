To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Densely Fused Spatial Transformer Networks" by Annunziata, Sagonas, and Cala, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The introduction mentions the use of MNIST, GTSRB, and IDocDB datasets.

In the **methodology section**, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits.
2. **GTSRB**: A dataset of traffic signs.
3. **IDocDB**: A dataset of official identity documents.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun. The mnist database of handwritten digits. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

- For **GTSRB**, the citation is:
  > Johannes Stallkamp, Marc Schlipsing, Jan Salmen, and Christian Igel. The german traffic sign recognition benchmark: a multi-class classification competition. In Proceedings of International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), pages 1453-1460, 2011.

- For **IDocDB**, the citation is:
  > (No explicit citation found)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
