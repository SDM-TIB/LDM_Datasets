To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AriEL: volume coding for sentence generation" by Luca Celotti, Simon Brodeur, and Jean Rouat, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The introduction mentions the toy grammar and the human dialogue dataset.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation, including:

1. **Toy dataset**: A dataset of sentences generated from a context-free grammar.
2. **Human dialogue dataset**: A dataset of sentences written by humans while playing a cooperative game, known as the GuessWhat?! dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Toy dataset**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For **Human dialogue dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. De Vries, F. Strub, S. Chandar, O. Pietquin, H. Larochelle, and A. C. Courville. *Guesswhat?! Visual object discovery through multi-modal dialogue*. In IEEE CPVR, vol. 1, no. 2, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
