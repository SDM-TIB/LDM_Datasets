To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Convolutional Networks with Pairwise Spatial Transformer Networks for Partial Person Re-identiication" by Hao Luo, Wei Jiang, Xing Fan, Chi Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the partial person re-identiication task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing methods for partial person re-identiication and the importance of developing new approaches. They hint at the evaluation of their proposed method on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Partial-ReID**: This dataset is used for partial person re-identiication tasks.
2. **Partial-iLIDS**: This dataset is used for partial person re-identiication tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their proposed method.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Partial-ReID**, the citation is:
  > W.-S. Zheng, X. Li, T. Xiang, S. Liao, J. Lai, and S. Gong, *Partial person re-identiication*. In Proceedings of Conference on Computer Vision, 2015, pp. 4678–4686.

- For **Partial-iLIDS**, the citation is:
  > W.-S. Zheng, S. Gong, and T. Xiang, *Person re-identiication by probabilistic relative distance comparison*. In Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2011, pp. 649–656.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
