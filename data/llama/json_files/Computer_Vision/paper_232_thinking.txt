To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep-COVID: Predicting COVID-19 From Chest X-Ray Images Using Deep Transfer Learning" by Shervin Minaee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the application of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the COVID-19 pandemic and the importance of early diagnosis. They mention the use of chest radiography imaging as a routine tool for pneumonia diagnosis.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **COVID-Xray-5k**: This dataset contains 5,000 Chest X-ray images, divided into 2,000 training and 3,000 testing samples.
2. **ChexPert**: This dataset contains 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients, labeled for the presence of 14 sub-categories.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **COVID-Xray-5k**, the citation is:
  > Shervin Minaee, Rahele Kaieh, Milan Sonka, Shakib Yazdani, and Ghazaleh Jamalipour Souie. *Deep-COVID: Predicting COVID-19 From Chest X-Ray Images Using Deep Transfer Learning*. Medical Image Analysis, 2021.

- For **ChexPert**, the citation is:
  > Jeremy Irvin, Pranav Rajpurkar, Michael Ko, Yifan Yu, Silviana Ciurea-Ilcus, Chris Chute, Henrik Marklund, and others. *Chexpert: A Large Chest Radiograph Dataset with Uncertainty Labels and Expert Comparison*. Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
