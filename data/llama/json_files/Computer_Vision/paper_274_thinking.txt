To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Architecture Transformer for Accurate and Compact Architectures" by Yong Guo, Yin Zhang, Mingkui Tan, Qi Chen, Jian Chen, Peilin Zhao, and Junzhou Huang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of architectures for image classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing architecture optimization methods and the importance of designing effective architectures for image classification tasks. They hint at the evaluation of these architectures on two benchmark datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset is used for image classification tasks.
2. **ImageNet**: This dataset is used for image classification tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., & Hinton, G. E. (2012). ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks. In Advances in neural information processing systems (NIPS) 25 (pp. 1097-1105).

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 248-255).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
