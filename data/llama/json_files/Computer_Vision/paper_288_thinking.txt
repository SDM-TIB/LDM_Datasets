To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disentangled Representation Learning" by Nicki S. Detlefsen, Sa Ren Hauberg, and Aske S. Oehlberg, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of four datasets: Sprites, MNIST, SMPL, and CelebA.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of disentangled representation learning and the need for a formalized notion of disentanglement.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Sprites**: A standard disentanglement benchmarking dataset.
2. **MNIST**: A dataset used for disentanglement of style and content.
3. **SMPL**: A synthetic image dataset used for disentanglement of body shape and pose.
4. **CelebA**: A facial image dataset used for disentanglement of facial features and shape.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Sprites**, the citation is:
  > Matthey et al. (2017) - dsprites: Disentanglement testing sprites dataset.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > LeCun et al. (1998) - MNIST dataset.

- For **SMPL**, the citation is:
  > Loper et al. (2015) - SMPL: A skinned multi-person linear model.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Liu et al. (2015) - CelebA: A large face dataset with over 200,000 images.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
