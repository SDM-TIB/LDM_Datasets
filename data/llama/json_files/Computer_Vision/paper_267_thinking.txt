To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UNIFIED, REPRODUCIBLE, AND INTEGRATABLE OPEN SOURCE END-TO-END TEXT-TO-SPEECH TOOLKIT" by Tomoki Hayashi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the LJSpeech dataset and the evaluation of the ESPnet-TTS toolkit on it.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of end-to-end text-to-speech (E2E-TTS) systems and the need for a unified toolkit.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the LJSpeech dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the LJSpeech dataset was used for evaluation of the ESPnet-TTS toolkit.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the LJSpeech dataset:

- For **LJSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
