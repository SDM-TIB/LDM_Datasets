To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Patent landscaping" by Seokkyu Cho, Hyeonju Lee, Eunjeong Park, Sungchul Cho, and others, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the proposal of an automated patent landscaping model and the use of benchmark datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of patent landscaping and the need for automated methods.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for benchmarking. Here, the authors mention four named datasets:

1. **KISTA datasets for patent landscaping**: These datasets are built using KISTA patent report maps.
2. **MPUART dataset**: This dataset is used for the MPUART technology area.
3. **MWDFS dataset**: This dataset is used for the MWDFS technology area.
4. **MRRG dataset**: This dataset is used for the MRRG technology area.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for benchmarking their model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **KISTA datasets**, the citation is:
  > Seokkyu Cho, Hyeonju Lee, Eunjeong Park, Sungchul Cho, and others. *Patent landscaping*. Journal, 2019.

- For **MPUART dataset**, the citation is:
  > Seokkyu Cho, Hyeonju Lee, Eunjeong Park, Sungchul Cho, and others. *Patent landscaping*. Journal, 2019.

- For **MWDFS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Seokkyu Cho, Hyeonju Lee, Eunjeong Park, Sungchul Cho, and others. *Patent landscaping*. Journal, 2019.

- For **MRRG dataset**, the citation is:
  > Seokkyu Cho, Hyeonju Lee, Eunjeong Park, Sungchul Cho, and others. *Patent landscaping*. Journal, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
