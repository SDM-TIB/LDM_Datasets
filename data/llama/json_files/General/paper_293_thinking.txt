To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Character-based NMT with Transformer" by Rohit Gupta, Laurent Besaciera, Marc Dymetman, and Matthias Gall, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of character-based NMT models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of word-level NMT models and the potential of character-level models. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **WMT 2016 news translation test set**
2. **IWSLT 2014 corpus**
3. **WMT 2016 biomedical translation test set**
4. **Europarl corpus**
5. **Common Crawl corpus**
6. **TED Talks corpus**

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WMT 2016 news translation test set**, the citation is:
  > [47]

- For **IWSLT 2014 corpus**, the citation is:
  > [49]

- For **WMT 2016 biomedical translation test set**, the citation is:
  > [48]

- For **Europarl corpus**, the citation is:
  > [48]

- For **Common Crawl corpus**, the citation is:
  > [47]

- For **TED Talks corpus**, the citation is:
  > [49]

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
