To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Token-Level Ensemble Distillation for Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion" by Hao Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the CMU-Dict dataset and an internal English dataset.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of G2P conversion and the limitations of previous works. They also mention the CMU-Dict dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the CMU-Dict dataset and their internal dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CMU-Dict**, the citation is:
  > [21] B. Milde, C. Schmidt, and J. KA ohler, aMultitask sequence-to-sequence models for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion.a in IN-TERSPEECH, 2017, pp. 2536a2540.

- For the **internal dataset**, the citation is:
  > [32] K. Song, X. Tan, T. Qin, J. Lu, and T.-Y. Liu, aMass: Maskedsequence to sequence pre-training for language generation,a arXivpreprint arXiv:1905.02450, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
