To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Progressive Word-vector Elimination for Inference Time Reduction of BERT" by Saurabh Goyal, Anamitra R. Choudhury, Saurabh M. Raje, Venkatesan T. Chakaravarthy, Yogish Sabharwal, and Ashish Verma, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the BERT model, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of the BERT model and the importance of inference time reduction. They hint at the evaluation of the proposed method on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **GLUE benchmark**: A collection of 9 tasks for natural language understanding.
2. **IMDB**: A dataset for sentiment analysis.
3. **RACE**: A dataset for question answering.
4. **SST-2**: A dataset for sentiment analysis.
5. **MNLI**: A dataset for natural language inference.
6. **NLI**: A dataset for natural language inference.
7. **STS-B**: A dataset for sentiment analysis.
8. **SIMILARITY**: A dataset for similarity analysis.
9. **PARAPHRASE**: A dataset for paraphrase detection.
10. **ACCEPTABILITY**: A dataset for acceptability analysis.
11. **NLISIMILARITY**: A dataset for similarity analysis.
12. **SENTIMENTQA**: A dataset for sentiment analysis.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their method, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **GLUE benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Wang et al. [2019a]

- For **IMDB**, the citation is:
  > Maas et al. [2011]

- For **RACE**, the citation is:
  > Lai et al. [2017]

- For **SST-2**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar et al. [2016]

- For **MNLI**, the citation is:
  > Narasimhan et al. [2019]

- For **NLI**, the citation is:
  > Devlin et al. [2019]

- For **STS-B**, the citation is:
  > Wang et al. [2019b]

- For **SIMILARITY**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar et al. [2016]

- For **PARAPHRASE**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar et al. [2016]

- For **ACCEPTABILITY**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar et al. [2016]

- For **NLISIMILARITY**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar et al. [2016]

- For **SENTIMENTQA**, the citation is:
  > Liu et al. [2019]

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
