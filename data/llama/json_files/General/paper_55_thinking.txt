To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BERT for Evidence Retrieval and Claim Verification" by Amir Soleimani, Christof Monz, and Marcel Worring, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the FEVER fact extraction and verification challenge, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the FEVER dataset, which consists of 185K generated claims labeled as aSUPPORTEDa, aREFUTEDa, or aNOTClaima.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the FEVER dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the FEVER dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the FEVER dataset:

- For FEVER, the citation is:
  > James Thorne, Andreas Vlachos, Christos Christodoulopoulos, and Arpit Mittal. *FEVER: A large-scale dataset for fact extraction and verification*. CoRR, abs/1803.05355.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
