To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Baidu Neural Machine Translation Systems for WMT19" by Meng Sun, Bojian Jiang, Hao Xiong, Zhongjun He, Hua Wu, and Haifeng Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various datasets for training and evaluation of the neural machine translation systems.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of pre-trained language models and monolingual corpora for training the neural machine translation systems.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **WMT19 News Corpus**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the neural machine translation systems.
2. **Gigaword**: This dataset is used for pre-training the language models.
3. **News Crawl**: This dataset is used for pre-training the language models.
4. **Chinese Gigaword**: This dataset is used for pre-training the Chinese language model.
5. **Chinese News Crawl**: This dataset is used for pre-training the Chinese language model.
6. **XMU**: This dataset is used for pre-training the Chinese language model.
7. **CWMT**: This dataset is used for pre-training the English language model.
8. **UN**: This dataset is used for pre-training the English language model.
9. **Wiki Titles**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the neural machine translation systems.
10. **CWMT UN**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the neural machine translation systems.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WMT19 News Corpus**, the citation is:
  > No specific citation found

- For **Gigaword**, the citation is:
  > No specific citation found

- For **News Crawl**, the citation is:
  > No specific citation found

- For **Chinese Gigaword**, the citation is:
  > No specific citation found

- For **Chinese News Crawl**, the citation is:
  > No specific citation found

- For **XMU**, the citation is:
  > No specific citation found

- For **CWMT**, the citation is:
  > No specific citation found

- For **UN**, the citation is:
  > No specific citation found

- For **Wiki Titles**, the citation is:
  > No specific citation found

- For **CWMT UN**, the citation is:
  > No specific citation found

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
