To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Make Generalizable and Diverse Predictions for Retrosynthesis" by Benson Chen, Tianxiao Shen, Tommi S. Jaakkola, and Regina Barzilay, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the USPTO-50k dataset.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of template-based approaches and the importance of generalizability and diversity in retrosynthesis.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **USPTO-50k**: A dataset of 50k reaction examples from the United States patent literature.
2. **Template-based approach**: A dataset used for template extraction, but not explicitly mentioned as a separate dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the USPTO-50k dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the USPTO-50k dataset:

> Benson Chen, Tianxiao Shen, Tommi S. Jaakkola, and Regina Barzilay. Learning to Make Generalizable and Diverse Predictions for Retrosynthesis. arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.02308, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
