To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT" by Omar Khattab and Matei Zaharia, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of ColBERT on two passage search datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the recent progress in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and its impact on Information Retrieval (IR). They mention the use of fine-tuning deep language models (LMs) for document ranking.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two passage search datasets:

1. **MS MARCO**: A dataset consisting of 8.8M passages from Web pages, which were gathered from Bing as results to 1M real-world queries.
2. **TREC CAR**: A synthetic dataset based on Wikipedia that consists of about 29M passages.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of ColBERT.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MS MARCO**, the citation is:
  > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A Human-Generated Machine Reading Comprehension Dataset*. (2016).

- For **TREC CAR**, the citation is:
  > Laura Dietz, Manisha Verma, Filip Radlinski, and Nick Craswell. *TREC Complex Answer Retrieval Overview*. In TREC.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
