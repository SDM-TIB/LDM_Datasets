To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Distance Relationships without Time Travel: Boosting the Performance of a Sparse Predictive Autoencoder in Sequence Modeling" by Jeremy Gordon, David Rawlinson, and Subutai Ahmad, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the language modeling task on the Penn Treebank dataset, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the sequence learning domain and the challenge of modeling relationships between related elements separated by long temporal distances. They mention the MNIST dataset and the Penn Treebank dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits.
2. **Penn Treebank**: A dataset of text for language modeling.
3. **PTB**: A dataset of text for language modeling.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for language modeling tasks.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bourges, F., & Chapelle, O. (2010). Pattern recognition and machine learning. Springer.

- For **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, M. P., Kim, J., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., MacIntyre, R., Bies, A., Ferguson, M., Katz, K., & Schasberger, B. (1994). The penn treebank: annotating predicate argument structure. In Proceedings of the 1994 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), pages 70–75.

- For **PTB**, the citation is:
  > Mikolov, T., Deoras, A., Kombrink, S., Burget, L., & Cernocky, J. (2011). Recurrent neural network based language model. In Eleventh annual conference of the international speech communication association (ICASSP), pages 5528–5531.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
