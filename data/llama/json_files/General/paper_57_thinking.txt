To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empirical Evaluation of Sequence-to-Sequence Models for Word Discovery in Low-resource Settings" by Marcely Zanon Boito, Aline Villavicencio, and Laurent Besacier, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of sequence-to-sequence models for word discovery in low-resource settings, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the evaluation of sequence-to-sequence models for word discovery from unsegmented phoneme sequences, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **EN-FR corpus**: A 33,192 sentence multilingual extension from librispeech, with English audiobooks automatically aligned to French translations.
2. **MB-FR corpus**: A 5,130 sentence corpus from the language documentation process of Mboshi (Bantu C25), an endangered language spoken in Congo-Brazzaville.
3. **ZRC 2017 evaluation suite (track 2)**: A dataset used for evaluating the ZeroResource Challenge 2017.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **EN-FR corpus**, the citation is:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audiobooks*. In Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP 2015, South Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, April 19-24, 2015, 2015, pp. 5206â€“5210.

- For **MB-FR corpus**, the citation is:
  > A. C. Kocabiyikoglu, L. Besacier, and O. Kraif. *Augmenting librispeech with French translations: A multimodal corpus for direct speech translation evaluation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.03142, 2018.

- For **ZRC 2017 evaluation suite (track 2)**, the citation is:
  > Available at http://zerospeech.com/2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
