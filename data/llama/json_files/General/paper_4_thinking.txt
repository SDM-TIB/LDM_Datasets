To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TMU Transformer System Using BERT for Re-ranking at BEA 2019" by Masahiro Kaneko, Kengo Hotate, Satoru Katsumata, and Mamoru Komachi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the BEA 2019 shared task on grammatical error correction, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of selecting an appropriate hypothesis sentence from the candidates list generated by the GEC model. They mention the FCE (First Certificate in English) corpus, Lang-8 learner corpus, NUCLE (National University of Singapore Corpus of Learner English), and W&I+LOCNESS corpus.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **FCE (First Certificate in English) corpus**
2. **Lang-8 learner corpus**
3. **NUCLE (National University of Singapore Corpus of Learner English)**
4. **W&I+LOCNESS corpus**
5. **W&I test data**
6. **Development set of W&I+LOCNESS corpus**
7. **Train set of FCE corpus**
8. **Development set of FCE corpus**
9. **Test set of FCE corpus**
10. **Train set of NUCLE corpus**
11. **Development set of NUCLE corpus**
12. **Test set of NUCLE corpus**
13. **Train set of W&I+LOCNESS corpus**
14. **Development set of W&I+LOCNESS corpus**
15. **Test set of W&I+LOCNESS corpus**

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **FCE corpus**, the citation is:
  > Yannakoudakis et al. (2011) developed a new dataset and method for automatically grading ESOL texts.

- For **Lang-8 corpus**, the citation is:
  > Helen Yannakoudakis, Ted Briscoe, and Ben Medlock. 2011. A New Dataset and Method for Automatically Grading ESOL Texts.

- For **NUCLE corpus**, the citation is:
  > Hwee Tou Ng, Siew Mei Wu, Ted Briscoe, Christian Hadiwinoto, Raymond Hendy Susanto, and Christopher Bryant. 2014. The CoNLL-2014 Shared Task on Grammatical Error Correction.

- For **W&I+LOCNESS corpus**, the citation is:
  > Yan-nakoudakis et al. (2018) developed a new corpus for the Write & Improve (W&I) task.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
