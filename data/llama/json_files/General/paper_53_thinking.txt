To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cost-Sensitive BERT for GeneralisableSentence Classification with Imbalanced Data" by Harish Tayyar Madabushi, Elena Kochkina, and Michael Castelle, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the propaganda detection task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of imbalanced classiication and the importance of generalising models to dissimilar data. They hint at the use of the Propaganda Techniques Corpus (PTC) dataset for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the Propaganda Techniques Corpus (PTC) dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the PTC dataset was used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PTC dataset:

- For **PTC**, the citation is:
  > Da San Martino, Giovanni; Yu, Seunghak; BarrA on-CedeEno, Alberto; Petrov, Rostislav; Nakov, Preslav. *Fine-grained analysis of propaganda in news articles*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019, Hong Kong, China, November 3-7, 2019, pages 1â€“12. Association for Computational Linguistics. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/P19-1001

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
