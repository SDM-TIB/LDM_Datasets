To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cognate-aware morphological segmentation for multilingual neural translation" by Stig-Arne GrAnroos, Sami Virpioja, and Mikko Kurimo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of a multilingual sub-track in the WMT18 News Translation SharedTask, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of morphological segmentation for multilingual translation systems and the need for consistency in segmentations.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Finnish-Estonian parallel data**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the multilingual translation system.
2. **English-Finnish parallel data**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the multilingual translation system.
3. **English-Estonian parallel data**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the multilingual translation system.
4. **Finnish-Estonian cognate pairs**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the Cognate Morfessor segmentation model.
5. **English-Finnish-Estonian multilingual sentence pairs**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the multilingual translation system.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Finnish-Estonian parallel data**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **English-Finnish parallel data**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **English-Estonian parallel data**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Finnish-Estonian cognate pairs**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **English-Finnish-Estonian multilingual sentence pairs**, the citation is:
  > Not found

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
