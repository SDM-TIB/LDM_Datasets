To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scheduled Sampling for Transformers" by Tsvetomila Mihaylova and Andr A e F. T. Martins, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of sequence-to-sequence generation and the importance of avoiding exposure bias. They hint at the evaluation of models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two language pairs:

1. **IWSLT 2017 German-English (DE-EN) corpus**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks.
2. **IWSLT 2017 Japanese-English (JA-EN) corpus**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **IWSLT 2017 DE-EN**, the citation is:
  > Mauro Cettolo, Marcello Federico, Luisa Bentivogli, Niehues Jan, StA uker Sebastian, Sudoh Katsuitho, Yoshino Koichiro, and Federmann Christian. *Overview of the iwslt 2017 evaluation campaign*. In International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, pages 2-14, 2017.

- For **IWSLT 2017 JA-EN**, the citation is:
  > Mauro Cettolo, Marcello Federico, Luisa Bentivogli, Niehues Jan, StA uker Sebastian, Sudoh Katsuitho, Yoshino Koichiro, and Federmann Christian. *Overview of the iwslt 2017 evaluation campaign*. In International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, pages 2-14, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
