To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-label Categorization of Accounts of Sexism using a Neural Framework" by Pulkit Parikh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the creation of a dataset for sexism categorization, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing work on sexism classification and the need for a multi-label categorization approach. They hint at the creation of a new dataset for this purpose.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the dataset used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the creation of a dataset comprising 13023 accounts of sexism, including 1st-person accounts from survivors, each tagged with at least one of 23 categories of sexism.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that this dataset was used for evaluation of their model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for this dataset:

- For the dataset, the citation is:
  > Pulkit Parikh, Harika Abburi, Pinkesh Badjatiya, Radhika Krishnan, Niyati Chhaya, Manish Gupta, and Vasudeva Varma. *Multi-label Categorization of Accounts of Sexism using a Neural Framework*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.09644 (2021)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
