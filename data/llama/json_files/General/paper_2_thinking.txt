To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reverse, Retrieve, and Rank for Sarcasm Generation with Commonsense Knowledge" by Tuhin Chakrabarty, Debanjan Ghosh, Smaranda Muresan, and Nanyun Peng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the biomedical domain, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of word2vec and the importance of character-based representations like fastText. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named entity recognition corpora:

1. **Ghosh et al. (2020)**: This dataset is used for sarcasm generation tasks.
2. **Peled and Reichart (2017)**: This dataset is used for sarcasm interpretation tasks.
3. **Mishra et al. (2019)**: This dataset is used for sarcasm generation tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Ghosh et al. (2020)**, the citation is:
  > Debanjan Ghosh, Alexander R Fabbri, and Smaranda Muresan. 2020. Interpreting verbal irony: Linguistic strategies and the connection to the type of semantic incongruity. Proceedings of the Society for Computation in Linguistics, 3(9):76a87.

- For **Peled and Reichart (2017)**, the citation is:
  > Lotem Peled and Roi Reichart. 2017. Sarcasm SIGN: Interpreting sarcasm with sentiment based monolingual machine translation. 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1690a1700, Vancouver, Canada. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **Mishra et al. (2019)**, the citation is:
  > Abhijit Mishra, Tarun Tater, and Karthik Sankaranarayanan. 2019. A modular architecture for unsupervised sarcasm generation. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 6146a6155, Hong Kong, China. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
