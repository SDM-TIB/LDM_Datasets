To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLaC Lab at SemEval-2019 Task 3: Contextual Emotion Detection Using a Combination of Neural Networks and SVM" by Eham Mohammadi, Hessam Amini and Leila Kosseim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the EmoContext task and the dataset used for the task.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the EmoContext task and the dataset used for the task.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the EmoContext dataset:

1. **EmoContext dataset**: This dataset consists of 3-round dialogues.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the EmoContext dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the EmoContext dataset:

- For the EmoContext dataset, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
