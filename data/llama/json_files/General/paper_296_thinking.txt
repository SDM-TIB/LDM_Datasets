To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BioFLAIR: Pretrained Pooled Contextualized Embeddings for Biomedical Sequence Labeling Tasks" by Shreyas Sharma, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of FLAIR on various bio NER benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of biomedical NER and the limitations of existing models. They hint at the evaluation of FLAIR on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **NCBI-disease**: A dataset for disease recognition.
2. **BC5CDR-disease**: A dataset for disease recognition.
3. **BC5CDR**: A dataset for chemical-drug recognition.
4. **JNLPBA**: A dataset for protein recognition.
5. **Species-800**: A dataset for species recognition.
6. **LINNAEUS**: A dataset for species recognition.
7. **Conll-03**: A dataset for NER.
8. **Ontonotes**: A dataset for NER.
9. **PubMed (V1)**: A dataset for biomedical text mining.
10. **PubMed (V2)**: A dataset for biomedical text mining.
11. **PubMed (V3)**: A dataset for biomedical text mining.
12. **NCBI (+BC5DR-disease)**: A dataset for disease recognition.
13. **BC5DR-disease (+ NCBI)**: A dataset for disease recognition.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of FLAIR, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
