To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Microsoft Translator at WMT 2019: Towards Large-Scale Document-Level Neural Machine Translation" by Marcin Junczys-Dowmunt, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the Microsoft Translator submissions to the WMT19 news translation shared task for English-German.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the main focus of the paper, which is document-level neural machine translation with deep transformer models.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Europarl**: A parallel corpus for European languages.
2. **Rapid**: A parallel corpus for rapid languages.
3. **News-Commentary**: A parallel corpus for news and commentary.
4. **News-Crawl**: A monolingual news crawl dataset.
5. **Paracrawl**: A monolingual dataset for German.
6. **WMT18**: A parallel corpus for the WMT18 news translation task.
7. **test2016**, **test2017**, and **test2018**: Development sets for the WMT19 news translation task.
8. **test2016**, **test2017**, and **test2018** (split by source language): Development sets for the WMT19 news translation task, split by source language.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Europarl**, the citation is:

Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
