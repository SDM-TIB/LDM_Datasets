To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Warm-up and Self-Training:Training Strategies of NICT-2 NMT System at WAT-2019" by Kenji Imamura and Eiichiro Sumita, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the NICT-2 NMT system and the datasets used for training and testing.

In the **introduction**, the authors describe the NICT-2 NMT system and its training strategies, but do not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and testing. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **ASPEC**: A collection of scientific papers.
2. **TDDC**: A collection of timely disclosure documents.
3. **AsianScientiic Paper Excerpt Corpus**: A collection of scientific papers.
4. **Timely Disclosure Documents Corpus**: A collection of timely disclosure documents.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and testing the NICT-2 NMT system.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ASPEC**, the citation is:

Overview of the 6th workshop on Asian trans-lation. In Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on AsianTranslation, Hong Kong.
- For **TDDC**, the citation is:
