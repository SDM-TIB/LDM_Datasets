To extract datasets from the research paper titled "9102guA03]LC.sc[1v64110.9091:viXraBilingual is At Least Monolingual (BALM):A Novel Translation Algorithm that Encodes Monolingual Priors" by Jeffrey Cheng and Chris Callison-Burch, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the Multi30k dataset.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the Multi30k dataset, which is a multilingual extension of the Flickr30k image-captioning dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the Multi30k dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the Multi30k dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Multi30k dataset:

- For **Multi30k**, the citation is:
  > Desmond Elliott, Stella Frank, Khalil Simaaan, and Lucia Specia. Multi30k: Multilingual english-german image descriptions. CoRR, abs/1605.00459, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
