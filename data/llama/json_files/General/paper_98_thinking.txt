To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning in Biomedical Named Entity Recognition: An Evaluation of BERT in the PharmaCoNER task" by Cong Sun, Zhihao Yang, and others, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the PharmaCoNER task and the use of Multilingual BERT and BioBERT models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of conducting NLP research in non-English literature and mention the PharmaCoNER task, which is a Named Entity Recognition task for recognizing chemical and protein entities from Spanish biomedical texts.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the PharmaCoNER corpus and the BioBERT model, which is pre-trained on Wikipedia, BooksCorpus, PubMed (PubMed abstracts) and PMC (PubMedCentral full-text articles).

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the PharmaCoNER corpus was used for extrinsic evaluation of the Multilingual BERT and BioBERT models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PharmaCoNER corpus**, the citation is:
  > Gonzalez-Agirre et al. (2019) PharmaCoNER: Pharmaco-logical substances, compounds and proteins named entity recognition.
  > In Proceedings of the entity recognition track. BioNLP Open Shared Tasks (BioNLP-OST).

- For **BioBERT model**, the citation is:
  > Lee et al. (2019) BioBERT: pre-trained biomedical language representation model for biomedical text mining.
  > arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.08746.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
