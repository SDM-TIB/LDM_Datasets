To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Segatron: Segment-Aware Transformer for Language Modeling and Understanding" by He Bai, Peng Shi, Jimmy Lin, Yuqing Xie, Luchen Tan, Kun Xiong, and Wen Gao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the language modeling task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of vanilla Transformers and the importance of segment-aware representations for language modeling. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **WikiText-103**: A large word-level dataset with long-distance dependencies for language modeling.
2. **English Wikipedia**: A large corpus used for pre-training the SegaBERT model.
3. **BookCorpus**: A large corpus used for pre-training the SegaBERT model.
4. **SQUAD v1.1**: A dataset for question answering tasks.
5. **SQUAD v2.0**: A dataset for question answering tasks.
6. **RACE**: A large-scale reading comprehension dataset.
7. **STS-B**: A dataset for semantic textual similarity tasks.
8. **MNLI**: A dataset for natural language inference tasks.
9. **QNLI**: A dataset for question answering tasks.
10. **GLUE**: A benchmark for general language understanding tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
