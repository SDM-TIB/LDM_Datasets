To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Generalized Framework of Sequence Generation with Application to Undirected Sequence Models" by Elman Mansimov et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of various decoding algorithms on WMTa14 English-German translation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the problem of generating sequences directly from undirected models and propose a generalized framework of sequence generation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **WMTa14 English-German translation dataset**: This dataset consists of 4.5M parallel sentence pairs.
2. **newstest-2013 and newstest-2014**: These datasets are used as validation and test sets, respectively.

In the **results section**, the authors evaluate their proposed framework on the WMTa14 English-German translation dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WMTa14 English-German translation dataset**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For **newstest-2013 and newstest-2014**, the citations are not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
