To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Transformers for Diverse Response Generation" by Zhaojiang Lina, Genta Indra Winata, Peng Xu, Zihan Liu, and Pascale Fung, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed models on three conversational datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of Transformers in modeling one-to-many relations in dialogue response generation tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named conversational datasets:

1. **MojiTalk**: A dataset consisting of 596,959 post and response pairs from Twitter.
2. **PersonaChat**: A one-to-one multi-turn conversation dataset.
3. **Empathetic-Dialogues**: A one-to-one multi-turn conversation dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the proposed models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MojiTalk**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, W., & Wang, Y. (2018). MojiTalk: Generating emotional responses at scale. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1128–1137.

- For **PersonaChat**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, P., Duan, H., Self, B., Lan, Y., Gao, J., & Metzler, B. (2018). PersonaChat: A large-scale conversational AI dataset. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 2204–2213.

- For **Empathetic-Dialogues**, the citation is:
  > Rashkin, H., Smith, E. M., Li, M., & Boureau, Y.-L. (2019). Towards empathetic open-domain conversation models: A new benchmark and dataset. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 5370–5381.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
