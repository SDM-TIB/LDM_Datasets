To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Alternative Weighting Schemes for ELMo Embeddings" by Nils Reimers and Iryna Gurevych, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of different weighting schemes for ELMo embeddings, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional word embeddings and the use of ELMo embeddings in NLP tasks. They hint at the evaluation of these embeddings on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **Arguments**: A dataset for argument component detection in persuasive essays.
2. **ACE Entities**: A dataset for entity recognition.
3. **ACE Events**: A dataset for event detection.
4. **POS**: A dataset for part-of-speech tagging.
5. **Chunking**: A dataset for chunking.
6. **NER**: A dataset for named entity recognition.
7. **GENIA NER**: A dataset for named entity recognition in biomedical text.
8. **WNUT16**: A dataset for named entity recognition on Twitter.
9. **SST**: A dataset for sentiment analysis.
10. **SNLI**: A dataset for natural language inference.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Arguments**, the citation is:
  > Stab and Gurevych. 2017. Parsing Argumentation Structures in Persuasive Essays. Computational Linguistics, 43(3):619–659.

- For **ACE Entities**, the citation is:
  > Walker et al. 2005. ACE 2005 Multilingual Training Corpus. LDC Catalog No.: LDC2006T06.

- For **ACE Events**, the citation is:
  > Walker et al. 2005. ACE 2005 Multilingual Training Corpus. LDC Catalog No.: LDC2006T06.

- For **POS**, the citation is:
  > Universal Dependencies v. 1.3 for English.

- For **Chunking**, the citation is:
  > CoNLL 2000 shared task on chunking.

- For **NER**, the citation is:
  > CoNLL 2003 shared task on named entity recognition.

- For **GENIA NER**, the citation is:
  > Kim et al. 2004. Introduction to the bio-entity recognition task at JNLPBA. In Proceedings of the 2004 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), pages 70–75.

- For **WNUT16**, the citation is:
  > Strauss et al. 2016. Results of the WNUT16 Named Entity Recognition SharedTask. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text (WNUT), pages 138–144.

- For **SST**, the citation is:
  > Peters et al. 2018. Deep Contextualized Word Representations. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1499–1509.

- For **SNLI**, the citation is:
  > Peters et al. 2018. Deep Contextualized Word Representations. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1499–1509.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
