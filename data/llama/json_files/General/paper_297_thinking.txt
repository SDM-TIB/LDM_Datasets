To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding the Behaviors of BERT in Ranking" by Yifan Qiao, Zhenghao Liu, Chenyan Xiong, and Zhiyuan Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of MS MARCO and TREC Web Track datasets for ranking tasks.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of MS MARCO and TREC Web Track datasets for ranking tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MS MARCO**: A dataset used for passage ranking tasks.
2. **TREC Web Track**: A dataset used for ad hoc document ranking tasks.
3. **ClueWeb**: A dataset used for ad hoc document ranking tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MS MARCO**, the citation is:
  > Rodrigo Nogueira and Kyunghyun Cho. 2019. Passage Re-ranking with BERT. arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.04085 (2019).

- For **TREC Web Track**, the citation is:
  > TREC 2009-2012. TREC 2009-2012. 2009-2012.

- For **ClueWeb**, the citation is:
  > TREC 2009-2012. TREC 2009-2012. 2009-2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
