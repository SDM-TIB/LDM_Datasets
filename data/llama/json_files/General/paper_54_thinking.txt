To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal Transforming Geometric Network for Protein Structure Prediction" by Jin Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the CASP12 competition and the use of the Protein Data Bank, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing models and the importance of protein structure prediction. They hint at the evaluation of their model on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the CASP12 ProteinNet dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the CASP12 ProteinNet dataset was used for evaluation of their model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CASP12 ProteinNet dataset:

- For CASP12 ProteinNet dataset, the citation is:
  > Mohammed AlQuraishi. Proteinnet: a standardized data set for machine learning of protein structure. In BMC Bioinformatics, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
