To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Semantic Transformer Networkwith Retrieval Style Word Generator" by Hwanhee Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the AVSD task and the DSTC7 and DSTC8 datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing systems for the AVSD task and the importance of incorporating semantic information.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **DSTC7**: A dataset for the AVSD task.
2. **DSTC8**: A dataset for the AVSD task.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DSTC7**, the citation is:
  > Alamri et al. (2018) Audio visual scene-aware dialog (avsd) challenge at dstc7.

- For **DSTC8**, the citation is:
  > Kim et al. (2019) The eighth dialog system technology challenge.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
