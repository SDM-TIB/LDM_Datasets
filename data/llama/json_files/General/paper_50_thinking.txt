To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention over Heads: A Multi-Hop Attention for Neural Machine Translation" by Shohei Iiday, Ryuichiro Kimuray, Hongyi Cuiy, Po-Hsuan Hungy, Takehito Utsuroy and Masaaki Nagatazy, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the neural machine translation task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of the original Transformer model and the importance of multi-head attention. They hint at the evaluation of the proposed multi-hop attention mechanism on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **IWSLT2017 German-to-English corpus**: This dataset is used for the German-to-English translation task.
2. **WMT17 German-to-English corpus**: This dataset is used for the German-to-English translation task.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **IWSLT2017 German-to-English corpus**, the citation is:
  > IWSLT 2017 German-English Corpus

- For **WMT17 German-to-English corpus**, the citation is:
  > WMT17 German-English Corpus

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
