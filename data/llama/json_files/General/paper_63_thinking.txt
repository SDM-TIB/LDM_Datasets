To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Insertion-Deletion Transformer" by Laura Ruisa, Mitchell Stern, Julia Proskurnia, and William Chan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the Insertion-Deletion Transformer on synthetic translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional sequence-to-sequence models and the potential of insertion-based models. They hint at the evaluation of the Insertion-Deletion Transformer on synthetic translation tasks, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two synthetic translation tasks:

1. **Alphabetic Sequence Shifting**: This task involves shifting alphabetic sequences.
2. **Caesaras Cipher**: This task involves translating text using the Caesaras cipher.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the Insertion-Deletion Transformer.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Alphabetic Sequence Shifting**, the citation is:
  > William Chan, Nikita Kitaev, Kelvin Guu, Mitchell Stern, and Jakob Uszkoreit. 2019. KERMIT: Gen-erative Insertion-Based Modeling for Sequences. In arXiv.

- For **Caesaras Cipher**, the citation is:
  > William Chan, Nikita Kitaev, Kelvin Guu, Mitchell Stern, and Jakob Uszkoreit. 2019. KERMIT: Gen-erative Insertion-Based Modeling for Sequences. In arXiv.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
