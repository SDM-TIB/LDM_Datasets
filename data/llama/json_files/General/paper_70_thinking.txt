To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal Dependencies According to BERT: Both More Specific and More General" by Tomasz Limisiewicz and Rudolf Rosa and David MareEcek, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the analysis of the form and extent of syntactic abstraction captured by BERT by extracting labeled dependency trees from self-attentions.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the comparison of BERT relations to Universal Dependencies (UD) annotations, showing that they often do not match one-to-one.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **EuroParl**: A parallel corpus for five European languages, automatically annotated with UD 2.0 models.
2. **Google Universal Dependency Treebanks**: For Indonesian, Korean, and Japanese.
3. **UD Turkish Treebank**: For Turkish.
4. **CoNLL2017 Shared Task**: For evaluation of mBERT in all languages.
5. **Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks**: For Czech, Finnish, German, and other languages.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **EuroParl**, the citation is:
  > Koehn (2004)

- For **Google Universal Dependency Treebanks**, the citation is:
  > McDonald et al. (2013)

- For **UD Turkish Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Sulubacak et al. (2016)

- For **CoNLL2017 Shared Task**, the citation is:
  > Nivre et al. (2017)

- For **Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks**, the citation is:
  > Nivre et al. (2016)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
