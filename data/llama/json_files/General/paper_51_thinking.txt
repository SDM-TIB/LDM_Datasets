To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Learning with Contextual Embeddings for Zero-resource Cross-lingual Classification and NER" by Phillip Keung, Yichao Lu, Vikas Bhardwaj, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of multilingual BERT and various NLP tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of multilingual BERT and its performance on zero-shot and zero-resource cross-lingual settings. They mention the XNLI dataset and the MLDoc corpus.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **XNLI**: A dataset for cross-lingual sentiment analysis.
2. **MLDoc**: A dataset for multilingual document classification.
3. **CoNLL 2002/2003**: A dataset for named entity recognition.
4. **German.train.10000**: A dataset for language-adversarial training.
5. **Japanese.train.10000**: A dataset for language-adversarial training.
6. **french.train.10000**: A dataset for language-adversarial training.
7. **ItaRuZh**: A dataset for language-adversarial training.
8. **EnDeEsFrItJaRuZh**: A dataset for language-adversarial training.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
