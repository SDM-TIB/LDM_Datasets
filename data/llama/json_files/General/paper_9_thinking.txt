To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VC.sc[1v98240.8091:viXraMulti-modality Latent Interaction Network for Visual Question Answering" by Peng Gao, Haoxuan You, Zhanpeng Zhang, Xiaogang Wang, and Hongsheng Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing methods for VQA and propose a new approach using a Multi-modality Latent Interaction Network (MLIN).

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **VQA v2.0**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the proposed MLIN model.
2. **TDIUC**: This dataset is also used for evaluation of the proposed MLIN model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **VQA v2.0**, the citation is:
  > Yash Goyal, Tejas Khot, Douglas Summers-Stay, Dhruv Batra, and Devi Parikh. *Making the V in VQA matter: Elevating the role of image understanding in Visual QuestionAnswering*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

- For **TDIUC**, the citation is:
  > Kushal Kaie and Christopher Kanan. *An analysis of visualquestion answering algorithms*. In Proceedings of the IEEEInternational Conference on Computer Vision, pages 1965a1973, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
