To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combating Adversarial Misspellings with Robust Word Recognition" by Danish Pruthi, Bhuwan Dhingra, Zachary C. Lipton, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of word recognition models on various datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of word recognition models and the need for robustness against adversarial attacks. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis tasks.
2. **IMDB movie reviews**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis tasks.
3. **SQuAD dataset**: This dataset is used for reading comprehension tasks.
4. **MRPC dataset**: This dataset is used for paraphrase detection tasks.
5. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: This dataset is used for gene recognition tasks.
6. **JNLPBA corpus**: This corpus annotates proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
7. **CHEMDNER corpus**: This dataset is focused on annotating drugs and chemicals.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SST**, the citation is:
  > Socher et al. (2013) Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment tree. In Proceedings of the 11th Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications, pages 242-251, Stroudsburg, PA, USA. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **IMDB movie reviews**, the citation is:
  > Maas et al. (2011) Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. In Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar et al. (2016) SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. In Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

- For **MRPC**, the citation is:

- For **BC2GM**, the citation is:

- For **JNLPBA**, the citation is:
  > Kim et al. (2004) Introduction to the bio-entity recognition task at JNLPBA. In Proceedings of the 2004 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), pages 70–75, 2004. http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-1213

- For **CHEMDNER**, the citation is:
  > Krallinger et al. (2015) CHEMDNER: The drugs and chemical names extraction challenge. Journal of Cheminformatics, 7(Suppl 1):S1, 2015. https://doi.org/10.1186/1758-2946-7-S1-S1

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
