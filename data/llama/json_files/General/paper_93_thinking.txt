To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-Shot Learning via Embedding Adaptation with Set-to-Set Functions" by Han-Jia Ye, Hexiang Hu, De-Chuan Zhan, and Fei Sha, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The introduction mentions the few-shot learning methods and the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation, including:

1. **MiniImageNet**: A dataset used for few-shot learning evaluation.
2. **TieredImageNet**: A dataset used for few-shot learning evaluation.
3. **CUB**: A dataset used for few-shot learning evaluation.
4. **OfficeHome**: A dataset used for few-shot learning evaluation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MiniImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Vinyals, O., & Hinton, G. E. (2016). Matching networks for one shot learning. In Advances in neural information processing systems (NIPS 2016) (pp. 3630-3638).

- For **TieredImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Girshick, R., He, K., Donahue, J., & Darrell, T. (2014). Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (pp. 6528-6534).

- For **CUB**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology.

- For **OfficeHome**, the citation is:
  > Venkateswara, H., Eusebio, J., Chakraborty, S., & Pan-chathan, S. (2017). Deep hashing network for unsupervised domain adaptation. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (pp. 5385-5394).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
