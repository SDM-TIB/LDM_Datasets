To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DIET: Lightweight Language Understanding for Dialogue Systems" by Tanja Bunk, Daksh Varshney, Vladimir Vlasov, and Alan Nichol, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of three datasets for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of dialogue language understanding and mention the use of two common approaches: end-to-end and modular systems.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **NLU-Benchmark**: A multi-domain NLU dataset.
2. **ATIS**: A well-studied dataset in the NLU field.
3. **SNIPS**: A dataset collected from the Snips personal voice assistant.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **NLU-Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Liu et al. (2019b), available online

- For **ATIS**, the citation is:
  > Hemphill et al. (1990), available online

- For **SNIPS**, the citation is:
  > Coucke et al. (2018), available online

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
