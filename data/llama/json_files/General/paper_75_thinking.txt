To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning for a Music Glove Instrument" by Joseph Bakarji, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the training and testing of a glove instrument, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional instrument design and the potential of a data-driven approach. They hint at the use of datasets for training and testing the glove instrument.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and testing. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Baselines**: A set of simple scales and 5-inger-to-5-notes performances.
2. **Training set**: A set of data collected from playing on the keyboard, including 5 pressure sensors and 1 iex sensor readings.
3. **Testing set**: A set of data collected from playing on the keyboard, including 5 pressure sensors and 1 iex sensor readings.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and testing the glove instrument.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Baselines**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Training set**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Testing set**, the citation is:
  > Not found

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
