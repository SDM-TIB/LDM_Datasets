To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention is Not Only a Weight:Analyzing Transformers with Vector Norms" by Goro Kobayashi, Tatsuki Kuribayashi, Sho Yokoi, and Kentaro Inui, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the analysis of BERT and a Transformer-based NMT system, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of weight-based analysis and the importance of considering the norm of the transformed vector.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for analysis. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **BERT dataset**: A dataset containing 992 sequences extracted from Wikipedia, where each sequence consists of two consecutive paragraphs.
2. **Transformer-based NMT system dataset**: A dataset used for analyzing the source-target attention in a Transformer-based NMT system.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for analysis.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **BERT dataset**, the citation is:
  > Clark et al. (2019) used the pre-trained BERT-base4, with 12 layers, each containing 12 attention heads.

- For **Transformer-based NMT system dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li et al. (2019) used the Europarl v7 corpus for training a Transformer-based NMT system.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
