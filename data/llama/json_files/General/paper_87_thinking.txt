To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ATTENTIONAL SPEECH RECOGNITION MODELS MISBEHAVE ON OUT-OF-DOMAIN UTTERANCES" by Phillip Keung, Wei Niu, Yichao Lu, Julian Salazar, and Vikas Bhardwaj, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the British National Corpus (BNC) and the LibriSpeech corpus.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the problem of echographic transcription in automatic speech recognition and mention the use of the LibriSpeech corpus for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **LibriSpeech corpus**: A large-scale speech recognition corpus.
2. **British National Corpus (BNC)**: A corpus of spontaneous conversations from UK English speakers.
3. **Word-level alignments**: Provided with the BNC corpus.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LibriSpeech corpus**, the citation is:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of Interspeech, pages 1â€“7, 2015.

- For **British National Corpus (BNC)**, the citation is:
  > John Coleman, Ladan Baghai-Ravary, John Pybus, and Sergio Grau. *Audio BNC: the audio edition of the Spoken British National Corpus*. Phonetics Laboratory, University of Oxford, 2012.

- For **Word-level alignments**, the citation is:
  > (No specific citation found)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
