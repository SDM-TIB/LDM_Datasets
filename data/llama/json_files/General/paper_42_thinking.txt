To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CRAM: Clued Recurrent Aattentionttention Model" by Minki Chung, Sungzoon Choa, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset for image inpainting task.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of convolutional neural network and the importance of visual attention mechanism. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various tasks, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named datasets:

1. **Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset**: This dataset is used for image inpainting task.
2. **MSRA10k dataset**: This dataset is used for image classification task.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., & Ng, A. Y. (2011). Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning (Vol. 2011, No. 2).

- For **MSRA10k**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Boser, B., Denker, J. S., Henderson, D., Howard, R. E., Hubbard, W., & Jackel, L. D. (1989). Backpropagation applied to handwritten zip code recognition. Neural computation, 1(4), 541-551.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
