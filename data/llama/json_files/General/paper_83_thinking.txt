To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OPTIMUS: Organizing Sentences via Pre-trained Modeling of a Latent Space" by Chunyuan Li, Xiang Gao, Yuan Li, Baolin Peng, Xiujun Li, Yizhe Zhang, Jianfeng Gao, we will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for language tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing language models and the importance of modeling sentence structures in a compact latent space. They hint at the evaluation of their model on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named entity recognition corpora:

1. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: This dataset is used for language modeling tasks.
2. **SNLI**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and language modeling tasks.
3. **Yahoo**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and language modeling tasks.
4. **Yelp**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and language modeling tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their model, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PTB**, the citation is:
  > Mitchell P. Marcus, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, and Beatrice Santorini. *Building a large annotated corpus of english: The penn treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 13(1), 1993.

- For **SNLI**, the citation is:
  > Samuel R. Bowman, Jason Weston, and Christopher Potts. *A new dataset for natural language inference*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1605.08173, 2016.

- For **Yahoo**, the citation is:
  > Not found.

- For **Yelp**, the citation is:
  > Dinghan Shen, Asli Celikyilmaz, Yizhe Zhang, Liqun Chen, Xin Wang, Jianfeng Gao, and Lawrence Carin. *Towards generating long and coherent text with multi-level latent variable models*. ACL, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
