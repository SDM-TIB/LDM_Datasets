To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Improved Image Mosaicing Algorithm for Damaged Documents" by Er. Waheeda Dhokley, Khan Munifa, and Shaikh Nazia, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of image mosaicing for damaged documents, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of image mosaicing for recovering damaged documents. They hint at the use of datasets for training and testing their algorithm.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Torn fragments dataset**: This dataset is used for training and testing the image mosaicing algorithm.
2. **Damaged documents dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the algorithm.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Torn fragments dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Damaged documents dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not found

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
