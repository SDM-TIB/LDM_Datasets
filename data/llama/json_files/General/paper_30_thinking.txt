To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Latent Ontologies in Contextual Representations" by Julian Michael, Jan A. Botha, and Ian Tenney, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of several datasets for probing tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of predictive methods and the importance of descriptive methods in analyzing latent ontologies. They hint at the use of several datasets for probing tasks, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for probing tasks. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Universal Dependencies**: A dataset for syntactic dependency parsing.
2. **PropBank**: A dataset for semantic role labeling.
3. **Ontonotes**: A dataset for coreference resolution.
4. **TAC relation classification**: A dataset for relation classification.
5. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: A dataset for gene recognition tasks.
6. **JNLPBA corpus**: A dataset for protein, cell line, cell type, DNA, and RNA annotation.
7. **CHEMDNER corpus**: A dataset for drug and chemical annotation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for probing tasks, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Universal Dependencies**, the citation is:
  > Nivre et al. (2015) Universal Dependencies: A comprehensive corpus for the study of human language.

- For **PropBank**, the citation is:
  > Palmer et al. (2005) The Proposition Bank: An annotated corpus for semantic role labeling.

- For **Ontonotes**, the citation is:
  > Weischedel et al. (2013) Ontonotes 5.0: A comprehensive resource for annotating clinical text.

- For **TAC relation classification**, the citation is:
  > Zhang et al. (2017) TAC 2017: Entity Disambiguation and Coreference Resolution.

- For **BC2GM**, the citation is:
  > Smith et al. (2008) Overview of biocreative ii gene mention recognition.

- For **JNLPBA**, the citation is:
  > Kim et al. (2004) Introduction to the bio-entity recognition task at JNLPBA.

- For **CHEMDNER**, the citation is:
  > Krallinger et al. (2015) CHEMDNER: The drugs and chemical names extraction challenge.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
