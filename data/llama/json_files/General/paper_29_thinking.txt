To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Context Enhanced Multi-Domain Dialogue System for Multi-domain Task Completion" by Jingyuan Yang, Guang Liu, Yuzhao Mao, Zhiwei Zhao, Weiguo Gao, Xuan Li, Haiqin Yang, Jianping Shen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the MultiWOZ dataset, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of single-domain dialogue systems and the importance of multi-domain dialogue systems. They hint at the use of the MultiWOZ dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the **MultiWOZ dataset**.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the MultiWOZ dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MultiWOZ dataset:

- For **MultiWOZ**, the citation is:
  > Budzianowski, P.; Wen, T.-H.; Tseng, B.-H.; Casanueva, I.; Ultes, S.; Ramadan, O.; and GaEsiA c, M. 2018. Multiwoz-a large-scale multi-domain wizard-of-oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.00278.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
