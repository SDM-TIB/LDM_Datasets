To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distantly-Supervised Neural Relation Extractionwith Side Information using BERT" by Johny Moreira, Chaina Oliveira, David MacEedo, Cleber Zanchettin, and Luciano Barbosa, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the RESIDE model and its use of side information from Knowledge Bases (KBs). They also mention the Google Distant Supervision (GDS) and Riedel datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Google Distant Supervision (GDS) dataset**: This dataset is used for relation extraction tasks.
2. **Riedel dataset**: This dataset is also used for relation extraction tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **GDS**, the citation is:
  > S. Riedel, L. Yao, and A. McCallum. *Modeling Relations and Their Mentions without Labeled Texta*. Proceedings of the 2010 Euro-pean Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery inDatabases: Part III, pp. 148-163.

- For **Riedel**, the citation is:
  > S. Riedel, L. Yao, A. McCallum. and B.M. Marlin. *Relation extraction with matrix factorization and universal schemasa*. Proceedings of the 2013 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association forComputational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, June 2013, pp. 74-84.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
