To extract datasets from the ICCV paper, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The paper discusses the evaluation of image-level and batch-level prediction models for image segmentation tasks.

In the paper, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **ResizeFull**: This dataset is used for evaluation of image-level prediction models.
2. **CropView**: This dataset is used for evaluation of image-level prediction models.
3. **AssociationModule**: This dataset is used for evaluation of batch-level prediction models.

These datasets are mentioned in the paper as follows:

- ResizeFull: "ResizeFull View(=800, <1333)"
- CropView: "Image-level Prediction (Crop View)"
- AssociationModule: "AssociationModuleBatch-LevelDecoder"

Now, I will check the references section to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ResizeFull**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For **CropView**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For **AssociationModule**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their descriptions from the paper.
