To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks" by Jinsung Yoona, Daniel Jarretta, Mihaela van der Schaar, and Alan Turing Institute, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed TimeGAN model on various time-series datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing methods for time-series data generation and the importance of capturing temporal dynamics.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Sines**: A multivariate sinusoidal sequence dataset.
2. **Stocks**: A continuous-valued, aperiodic dataset of stock prices.
3. **Energy**: A multivariate, continuous-valued dataset of energy measurements.
4. **Events**: A dataset of discrete events and their times.
5. **WaveNet**: A raw audio dataset.
6. **WaveGAN**: A synthetic audio dataset generated using WaveGAN.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their TimeGAN model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Sines**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Stocks**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Energy**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Events**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **WaveNet**, the citation is:
  > AAron Van Den Oord, Sander Dieleman, Heiga Zen, Karen Simonyan, Oriol Vinyals, Alex Graves, NalKalchbrenner, Andrew W Senior, and Koray Kavukcuoglu. *Wavenet: A generative model for raw audio*. SSW, 125, 2016.

- For **WaveGAN**, the citation is:
  > Not found

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
