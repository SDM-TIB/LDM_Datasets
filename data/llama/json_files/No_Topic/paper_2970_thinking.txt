To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Glyph2Vec: Learning Chinese Out-of-Vocabulary Word Embedding from Glyphs" by Hong-You Chen, Sz-Han Yu, and Shou-De Lin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of Chinese character glyphs to learn word embeddings, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of word2vec and the importance of character-based representations like fastText. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Sinica Corpus**: A large-scale Chinese corpus used for training and evaluation of word embeddings.
2. **Cangjie input method dictionary**: A dictionary of Chinese characters and their corresponding input methods.
3. **Wikipedia Title dataset**: A dataset of Chinese Wikipedia titles used for evaluation of the model's ability to handle out-of-vocabulary words.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Sinica Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Chen, H.-Y., Yu, S.-H., & Lin, S.-D. (2020). Glyph2Vec: Learning Chinese Out-of-Vocabulary Word Embedding from Glyphs. Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 2865-2871.

- For **Cangjie input method dictionary**, the citation is:
  > Not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

- For **Wikipedia Title dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu, F., Lu, H., Lo, C., & Neu, G. (2017). Learning character-level compositionality with visual features. Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 2059-2068.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
