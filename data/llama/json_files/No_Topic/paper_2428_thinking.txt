        To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2014)", I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the SemEval 2014 workshop, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the task of clinical text analysis, which involves recognizing disorders and encoding them to UMLS CUIs.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **Train set**: A dataset consisting of 199 notes, including discharge summaries, radiology reports, and ECG/ECHO reports.
2. **Development set**: A dataset consisting of 99 notes, including discharge summaries, radiology reports, and ECG/ECHO reports.
3. **Test set**: A dataset consisting of 133 notes, all of which are discharge summaries.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Train set**, the citation is:
  > Uzuner et al. (2010) extracted medication information from clinical text.

- For the **Development set**, the citation is:
  > Uzuner et al. (2011) 2010 i2b2/VA challenge on concepts, assertions, and relations in clinical text.

- For the **Test set**, the citation is:
  > Uzuner et al. (2011) 2010 i2b2/VA challenge on concepts, assertions, and relations in clinical text.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
