To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards HDR and HFR Video from Rolling-Mixed-Bit Spikings" by Yakun Chang, Yeliduosi Xiaokaiti, Yujia Liu, Bin Fan, Zhaojun Huang, Tiejun Huang, and Boxin Shi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the reconstruction of HDR and HFR videos from mixed-bit spikings, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of single-bit spikings and the importance of increasing the bit depth of spikings for HDR performance. They hint at the evaluation of their method on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Synthetic dataset**: A dataset synthesized for training and testing the proposed RMB-Net.
2. **Real-synthetic dataset**: A dataset consisting of real-world scenes captured by a spiking camera and simulated to have HDR and HFR properties.
3. **Real-world dataset**: A dataset of real-world scenes captured by a spiking camera.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their method, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **synthetic dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chang et al. [2] build a hybrid spike-RGB camera system to recover 1000FPS HDR video.

- For the **real-synthetic dataset**, the citation is:
  > Han et al. [19] and Yang et al. [55] leverage the intensity map reconstructed from events or spiking signals to compensate for LDR images.

- For the **real-world dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tiejun Huang, Yajing Zheng, Zhaofei Yu, Rui Chen, Yuan Li, Ruiqin Xiong, Lei Ma, Junwei Zhao, Siwei Dong, Lin Zhu, et al. [21] 1000 FPS HDR video with a Spike-RGB hybrid camera.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
