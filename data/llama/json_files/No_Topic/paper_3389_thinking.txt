To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Robust Learning to Optimize with Theoretical Guarantees" by Qingyu Song, CUHK, Wei Lin, CUHK, Juncheng Wang, HKBU, and Hong Xu, CUHK, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and convergence of L2O models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing L2O work and the importance of theoretical demonstration of performance and robustness. They hint at the evaluation of L2O models on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **LASSO Regression**: A regression problem used for evaluation.
2. **Logistic Regression**: A classification problem used for evaluation.
3. **JNLPBA corpus**: A named entity recognition corpus used for evaluation.
4. **BC2GM corpus**: A named entity recognition corpus used for evaluation.
5. **CHEMDNER corpus**: A named entity recognition corpus used for evaluation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LASSO Regression**, the citation is:
  > Tianlong Chen, Xiaohan Chen, Wuyang Chen, Zhangyang Wang, Howard Heaton, Jialin Liu, and Wotao Yin. Learning to optimize: A primer and a benchmark. The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 23(1):8562a8620, 2022.

- For **Logistic Regression**, the citation is:
  > Tianlong Chen, Xiaohan Chen, Wuyang Chen, Zhangyang Wang, Howard Heaton, Jialin Liu, and Wotao Yin. Learning to optimize: A primer and a benchmark. The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 23(1):8562a8620, 2022.

- For **JNLPBA corpus**, the citation is:
  > Jin-Dong Kim, Tomoko Ohta, Yoshimasa Tsuruoka, Yuka Tateisi, and Nigel Collier. Introduction to the bio-entity recognition task at JNLPBA. In Proceedings of the 2004 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), pages 70–75, 2004.

- For **BC2GM corpus**, the citation is:
  > Larry Smith, Lorraine K Tanabe, Rie Johnson nee Ando, Cheng-Ju Kuo, I-Fang Chung, Chun-Nan Hsu, Yu-Shi Lin, Roman Klinger, Christoph M Friedrich, Kuzman Ganchev, et al. Overview of biocreative ii gene mention recognition. Genome biology, 9(Suppl 2):1–19, 2008.

- For **CHEMDNER corpus**, the citation is:
  > Martin Krallinger, Florian Leitner, Obdulia Rabal, Miguel Vazquez, Julen Oyarzabal, and Alfonso Valencia. CHEMDNER: The drugs and chemical names extraction challenge. Journal of Cheminformatics, 7(Suppl 1):S1, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
