To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Language Technology for Cultural Heritage, Social Sciences, and Humanities, pages 11a19, Soia, Bulgaria, August 8 2013. c2013 Association for Computational Linguistics" I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the task of translating Middle Dutch to Modern Dutch, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the problem of data sparseness in language transformation tasks, particularly for diachronic language pairs like Middle Dutch and Modern Dutch.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Middle Dutch Modern Dutch corpus**: This dataset is used for the task of translating Middle Dutch to Modern Dutch.
2. **Beatrijs corpus**: This dataset is a selection of sentences from the Middle Dutch work Beatrijs, a Maria legend written around 1374 by an anonymous author.
3. **Comburg manuscript**: This dataset is a fragment of the Comburg manuscript that was written between 1380-1425.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Middle Dutch Modern Dutch corpus**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Beatrijs corpus**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Comburg manuscript**, the citation is:
  > Not found

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
