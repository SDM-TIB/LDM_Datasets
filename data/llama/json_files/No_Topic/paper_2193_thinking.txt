To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiaHClust: an iterative hierarchical clustering approach for identifying stages in language change" by Christin SchAtzle, Hannah Booth, and others, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus (IcePaHC) and the Penn-style treebank.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional periodization schemes and the need for a data-driven approach. They mention the use of hierarchical clustering and relative entropy.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus (IcePaHC)**: A Penn-style treebank containing approximately 1,000,000 words from 61 text extracts spanning 10 centuries.
2. **Penn-style treebank**: A dataset used for syntactic analysis.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for the analysis of syntactic change in Icelandic.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **IcePaHC**, the citation is:
  > Joel C. Wallenberg, Anton Karl Ingason, Einar Freyr SigurAsson, and EirAkur RAgnvaldsson. *Ice-landic Parsed Historical Corpus (IcePaHC), version 0.9*. http://linguist.is/icelandic_treebank

- For **Penn-style treebank**, the citation is:
  > Mitchell P. Marcus, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, and Beatrice Santorini. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: the Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2), 313-330, 1993.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
