To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpreting Deep Classification Models with Bayesian Inference" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of deep neural networks and the importance of interpretability. They hint at the use of Bayesian inference for model interpretation, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **MNIST dataset**: A dataset of handwritten digits.
2. **CIFAR10 dataset**: A dataset of images of 10 classes.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, LÃ©on Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the 37th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1999.

- For **CIFAR10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton. *ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
