To extract datasets from the Proceedings of the First Workshop on Commonsense Representation and Reasoning (CSRR 2021), I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the analysis of neural language models' understanding of commonsense pragmatics, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the focus on Language Model's performance in commonsense reasoning tasks, but no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Singh et al. (2016) human experiments stimuli**: This dataset is used for testing presupposition triggers.
2. **Nieuwland et al. (2010) dataset**: This dataset is used for testing scalar implicature.
3. **ImpPress dataset**: This dataset is used for fine-tuning DistillBERT with pragmatic inference tasks.
4. **Psycholinguistic datasets**: This is a general term for datasets used in psycholinguistic tests, but no specific dataset is mentioned.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Singh et al. (2016)**, the citation is:
  > Raj Singh, Evelina Fedorenko, Kyle Mahowald, and Edward Gibson. *Accommodating presuppositions is inappropriate in implausible contexts*. Cognitive Science, 40(6), 607–634, 2016.

- For **Nieuwland et al. (2010)**, the citation is:
  > Mante S. Nieuwland, Tali Ditman, and Gina R. Ku-perberg. *On the incrementality of pragmatic processing: An ERP investigation of informativeness and pragmatic abilities*. Journal of Memory and Language, 63(3), 324–346, 2010.

- For **ImpPress dataset**, the citation is:
  > Paloma Jeretic, Alex Warstadt, Suvrat Bhooshan, and Adina Williams. *Are natural language inference models IMPRESSive? Learning IMPlicature and PRESUPPOSITION*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 8690–8705, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
