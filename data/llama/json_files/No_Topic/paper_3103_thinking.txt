To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MIE: A Medical Information Extractor towards Medical Dialogues" by Yuanzhe Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the annotation of online medical consultation dialogues, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of annotating online medical consultation dialogues and the limitations of existing annotation methods.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for annotation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Chunyu-Doctor corpus**: This dataset is used for annotating online medical consultation dialogues.
2. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: This dataset is used for gene recognition tasks.
3. **JNLPBA corpus**: This corpus annotates proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
4. **CHEMDNER corpus**: This dataset is focused on annotating drugs and chemicals.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for annotating online medical consultation dialogues.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Chunyu-Doctor corpus**, the citation is:
  > https://github.com/nlpir2020/MIE-ACL-2020

- For **BC2GM**, the citation is:
  > Uzuner et al. (2011)

- For **JNLPBA**, the citation is:
  > Kim et al. (2004)

- For **CHEMDNER**, the citation is:
  > Krallinger et al. (2015)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
