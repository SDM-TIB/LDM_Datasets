To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Adapter at SemEval-2021 Task 10: Entropy-based Pseudo-Labeler for Source-free Domain Adaptation" by Sangwon Yoon, Yanghoon Kim, and Kyomin Jung, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the SemEval-2021 task 10 and the dataset used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the SemEval-2021 task 10 and the dataset used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SemEval-2018 Task 6 data**: This dataset is used for development data.
2. **Food security warnings systems**: This dataset is used for test data.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SemEval-2018 Task 6 data**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For **Food security warnings systems**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
