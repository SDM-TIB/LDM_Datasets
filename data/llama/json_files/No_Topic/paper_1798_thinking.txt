To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Pipeline for Zero-Shot Data-to-Text Generation" by Anonymous, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of two datasets: WebNLG and E2E.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of finetuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) on domain-specific data and the need for a zero-shot approach.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **WebNLG**: A dataset containing RDF triples from DBPedia and their crowdsourced descriptions.
2. **E2E**: A dataset containing restaurant recommendations in the form of attribute-value pairs.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WebNLG**, the citation is:
  > Claire Gardent, Anastasia Shimorina, Shashi Narayan, and Laura Perez-Beltrachini. *The WebNLG challenge: Generating text from RDF data*. In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Natural Language Generation, pages 124-133, 2017.

- For **E2E**, the citation is:
  > Ondrej DuAek, David M Howcroft, and Verena Rieser. *E2E: End-to-end generation of restaurant descriptions*. In Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Natural Language Generation, pages 201-206, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
