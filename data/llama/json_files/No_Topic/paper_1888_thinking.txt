To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multichannel LSTM-CNN for Telugu Technical Domain Identification" by Sunil Gundapu and Radhika Mamidi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the ICON shared task and the dataset used for training and evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of domain identification and the lack of research in regional languages, specifically Telugu.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **ICON shared task dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the proposed multichannel LSTM-CNN model.
2. **Telugu text dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the proposed multichannel LSTM-CNN model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ICON shared task dataset**, the citation is:
  > ICON Shared Task 2020 (Task h)
- For **Telugu text dataset**, the citation is:
  > ICON Shared Task 2020 (Task h)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
