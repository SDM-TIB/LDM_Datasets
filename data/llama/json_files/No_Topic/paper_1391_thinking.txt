To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Link Weight Prediction with Node Embeddings" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the approach on three different datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of deep learning to graph mining and the link weight prediction problem. They mention that the research on this problem is still in an early stage.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **Airport dataset**: A dataset containing the 500 busiest airports in the United States, with each edge weighted by the number of passengers traveling from one airport to another.
2. **Authors dataset**: A dataset containing 16726 authors, with each edge weighted by the number of papers posted by two authors to Condensed Matter section of arXiv E-Print Archive between 1995 and 1999.
3. **Collaboration dataset**: A dataset containing 226 nations on Earth, with each edge weighted by the number of academic papers whose author lists include that pair of nations.
4. **Congress dataset**: A dataset containing the 163 committees in the 102nd United States Congress, with each edge weighted by the number of shared members.
5. **Facebook dataset**: A dataset containing 899 users of a Facebook-like forum, with each edge weighted by the number of messages posted by two users on the same topics.
6. **Forum dataset**: A dataset containing 1899 users of a student social network at UC Irvine, with each edge weighted by the number of messages sent between users.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Airport dataset**, the citation is:
  > Colizza et al. (2007) Colizza et al., 2007. Reaction-adiffusion processes and metapopulation models in heterogeneous networks. Nature Physics, 3(4):276a282, 2007.

- For **Authors dataset**, the citation is:
  > Newman (2001) Newman, 2001. The structure of scientiic collaboration networks. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 98(2):404a409, 2001.

- For **Collaboration dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pan et al. (2012) Pan et al., 2012. World citation and collaboration networks: uncovering the role of geography in science. Scientiic reports, 2, 2012.

- For **Congress dataset**, the citation is:
  > Porter et al. (2005) Porter et al., 2005. A network analysis of committees in the us house of representatives. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 102(20):7057a7062, 2005.

- For **Facebook dataset**, the citation is:
  > Opsahl (2013) Opsahl, 2013. Triadic closure in two-mode networks: redefining the global and local clustering coefficients. Social networks, 35(2):159a167, 2013.

- For **Forum dataset**, the citation is:
  > Opsahl & Panzarasa (2009) Opsahl & Panzarasa, 2009. Clustering in weighted networks. Social networks, 31(2):155a163, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
