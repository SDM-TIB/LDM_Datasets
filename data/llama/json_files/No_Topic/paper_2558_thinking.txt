To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Task-Oriented Dialogue Architecture via Transformer Neural Language Models and Symbolic Injection" by Oscar J. Romero, Antian Wang, John Zimmerman, Aaron Steinfeld, and Anthony Tomasic, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the DSTC8 dataset and the use of a pre-trained GPT-2 transformer model.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of transformer models for task-oriented dialogue systems and the need for symbolic injection.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the DSTC8 dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the DSTC8 dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the DSTC8 dataset:

- For DSTC8, the citation is:
  > Rastogi et al. (2020) Schema-Guided Dialogue State Tracking Task at DSTC8.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
