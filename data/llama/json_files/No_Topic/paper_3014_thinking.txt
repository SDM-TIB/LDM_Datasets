    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DualGraph: A graph-based method for reasoning about label noise" by HaiYang Zhang, XiMing Xing, and Liang Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the biomedical domain, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing methods for learning with noisy labels and the importance of capturing structural relationships among labels.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class.
3. **Clothing1M**: A large-scale dataset of clothing images with noisy labels.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. N. (2012). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. University of Toronto.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. N. (2012). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. University of Toronto.

- For **Clothing1M**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, T., Xia, L., Yang, Y., Huang, T. J., & Wang, H. (2015). Learning from massive noisy labeled data for image classification. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2691-2699.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
