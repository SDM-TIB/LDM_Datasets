To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LRE Map, a Song of Resources and Evaluation" by Riccardo Del Gratta, Sara Goggi, Gabriella Pardelli, and Nicoletta Calzolari, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the LRE Map of Language Resources, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the purpose of the LRE Map and the importance of documenting language resources. They mention that the data analyzed here contain information about approximately 7500 resources.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for analysis. Here, the authors mention that the LRE Map contains information on:

1. **LRE Map data**: This dataset contains information about approximately 7500 language resources.
2. **LREC and COLING conferences**: These conferences provide data on language resources used and created during the conferences.

In the **results section**, the authors report on the global picture of language resources, different trends emerging from the diachronic perspective, and comparisons between LREC and COLING.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LRE Map data**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For **LREC and COLING conferences**, the citations are not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
