To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Argument-Level Interactions for Persuasion Comments Evaluation using Co-attention Model" by Lu Ji, Zhongyu Wei, Xiangkun Hu, Yang Liu, Qi Zhang, and Xuanjing Huang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of argumentative comments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing research on argumentative comments and the importance of incorporating argument-level interactions.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following dataset:

1. **CMV dataset**: This dataset is collected from the /r/ChangeMyView subreddit and consists of 3,456 training instances and 807 testing instances.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the CMV dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for this dataset:

- For **CMV dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chenhao Tan, Vlad Niculae, Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, and Lillian Lee. *Winning arguments: A study of online debate*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1214-1223, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
