To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-layer Annotation of the R. gveda" by Oliver Hellwig, Heinrich Hettrich, Ashutosh Modi, and Manfred Pinkal, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the introduction of a multi-layer annotation of the R. gveda, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors describe the individual annotation levels, including phonetics, morphology, lexicon, and syntax, and mention the use of a tagger that was originally developed for Classical Sanskrit.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **R. gveda corpus**: This dataset is used for the multi-layer annotation of the R. gveda.
2. **Classical Sanskrit corpus**: This corpus is used for the development and adaptation of the tagger.
3. **Vedic Sanskrit corpus**: This dataset is used for the adaptation of the tagger to Vedic Sanskrit.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for the annotation and evaluation of the tagger.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **R. gveda corpus**, the citation is:
  > van Nooten, B., and Holland, G. (1994). Rig Veda: A Metrically Restored Text with an Introduction and Notes. Harvard University.

- For **Classical Sanskrit corpus**, the citation is:
  > Hellwig, O. (2009). SanskritTagger, a stochastic lexical and POS tagger for Sanskrit. In G. Huet et al., editors, Sanskrit Computational Linguistics, pages 266-277, Berlin. Springer Verlag.

- For **Vedic Sanskrit corpus**, the citation is:
  > Hellwig, O. (2015a). Morphological disambiguation of Classical Sanskrit. In C. Mahlow et al., editors, Systems and Frameworks for Computational Morphology, pages 41-59, Cham. Springer.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
