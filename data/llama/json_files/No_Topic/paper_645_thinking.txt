To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Annotating and Analyzing Biased Sentences in News Articles using Crowdsourcing" by Sora Lim, Adam Jatowt, Michael FA arber, and Masatoshi Yoshikawa, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the proposal of a novel news bias dataset which facilitates the development and evaluation of approaches for detecting subtle bias in news articles and for understanding the characteristics of biased sentences.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the lack of publicly available datasets in the area of news bias detection, especially ones containing labels concerning bias on a fine-grained level.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for the proposed approach. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **News bias dataset**: This dataset consists of 966 sentences from 46 English-language news articles covering 4 different events and contains labels concerning bias on the sentence level.
2. **Media Bias/Fact Check dataset**: This dataset is used to categorize news sources into different political stances.
3. **Hyperpartisan News Detection dataset**: This dataset is used for hyperpartisan news detection and contains 754k news articles.
4. **Stance classification dataset**: This dataset is used for stance classification and describes the task of determining the stance of the author of a text document.
5. **Fake news detection dataset**: This dataset is used for fake news detection and contains 13,000 manually labeled short statements.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **News bias dataset**, the citation is:

  > Wang, W. Y. (2017). A liar, liar pants on fire: A new benchmark dataset for fake news detection. Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
