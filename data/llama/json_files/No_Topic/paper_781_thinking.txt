To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Harnessing Privileged Information for Hyperbole Detection" by Rhys Biddle, Maciej RybiÅ„ski, Anskia Qian, Lia CA, Cecile Parisa, Guandong Xua, and Advanced Analytics Institute, University of Technology Sydney, Australia, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the HYPO dataset and the HyperProbe suite.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the HYPO dataset, which is an annotated collection of hyperbole.

In the **materials and methods section**, the authors describe the HYPO dataset, which consists of three corpora:

1. **Hyperbole Corpus**: contains manually composed hyperbole and hyperbole sourced from various online sources, including click-bait headlines, love letters, advertisements, and animated cartoons.
2. **Paraphrase Corpus**: contains literal paraphrases of the hyperbolic utterances in the Hyperbole Corpus.
3. **Minimal Units Corpus**: contains examples that contain the hyperbolic words/phrases in a non-hyperbolic context.

In the **results section**, the authors mention the HYPO dataset and the HyperProbe suite.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **HYPO**, the citation is:
  > Troiano et al. (2018) introduce an NLP pipeline style approach to detecting hyperbole in their foundational work on computational hyperbole detection.

- For **HyperProbe**, the citation is:
  > Ribeiro et al. (2020) introduce a suite of synthetic test sentences to probe the capabilities of hyperbole detection models.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
