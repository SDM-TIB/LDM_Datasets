To extract datasets from the research paper titled "When is Lying the Right Choice?" by Federico Ceruttia et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of SDL-Lite and ITA-Controlled English for natural language generation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of controlling the spread of sensitive information and the need for controlled query evaluation mechanisms.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **PROV-O ontology**: This dataset is used for provenance representation.
2. **W3C standard PROV-O ontology**: This dataset is used for provenance representation.
3. **SDL-Lite knowledge base**: This dataset is used for subjective logic opinions.
4. **ITA-Controlled English**: This dataset is used for natural language generation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PROV-O ontology**, the citation is:
  > http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/

- For **W3C standard PROV-O ontology**, the citation is:
  > http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/

- For **SDL-Lite knowledge base**, the citation is:
  > SA ensoy et al., 2013

- For **ITA-Controlled English**, the citation is:
  > Mott, 2010

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
