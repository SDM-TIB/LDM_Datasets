To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Open Information Extraction for Spanish Language-based on Syntactic Constraints" by Alisa Zhila and Alexander Gelbukh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the introduction of an approach to Open IE for Spanish language.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing approaches to Open IE and the importance of developing a system for Spanish language.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **News Commentary Corpus**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the system's performance on parallel English-Spanish dataset.
2. **Raw Web dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the system's performance on noisy texts extracted from the Web.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **News Commentary Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Chris Callison-Burch, Philipp Koehn, Christof Monz, and Omar Zaidan. 2011. Findings of the 2011 workshop on statistical machine translation. In Proceedings of the Sixth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 22a64, Edinburgh, Scotland, July. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **Raw Web dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marshall Kirkpatrick. 2011. New 5 billion-page web index with page rank now available for foundation. readwrite.com. [last visited on 25/01/2013].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
