To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Redundancy Localization for the Conversationalization of Unstructured Responses" by Sebastian Krause, Mikhail Kozhevnikov, Eric Malmi, and Daniele Pighin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of models for redundancy localization, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of addressing redundancy in conversational responses and propose a new task called redundancy localization.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **EVAL dataset**: This dataset is used for manual annotation of redundancy labels.
2. **Wikipedia passages**: The authors use a passage-retrieval system to select relevant passages from Wikipedia for annotation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **EVAL dataset**, the citation is:
  > Eneko Agirre, Carmen Banea, Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre, Rada Mihalcea, German Rigau, and Janyce Wiebe. *SemEval-2016 task 1: Semantic textual similarity, monolingual and cross-lingual evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2016). Association for Computational Linguistics, San Diego, California, pages 497a511. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/S16-1081.

- For **Wikipedia passages**, the authors use a passage-retrieval system to select relevant passages from Wikipedia, but no specific citation is provided.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
