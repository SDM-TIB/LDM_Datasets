To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Other Learner Corpora in the 2013 NLI Shared Task" by Julian Brooke and Graeme Hirst, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the 2013 NLI shared task and the use of external corpora, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the potential benefits of using external corpora in NLI tasks, including the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE), the TOEFL-11, and the Lang-8.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for the open-training tasks. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **TOEFL-11**: A corpus of non-native English texts.
2. **ICLE**: The International Corpus of Learner English.
3. **FCE**: The First Certificate in English.
4. **ICCI**: The International Corpus of Crosslinguistic Interlanguage.
5. **ICANLE**: The International Corpus Network of Asian Learners of English.
6. **Lang-8**: A website where language learners write journal entries in their L2 to be corrected by native speakers.
7. **Indian corpora**: A collection of English language Indian news articles, tweets, and blog posts.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for the open-training tasks.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **TOEFL-11**, the citation is:
  > Daniel Blanchard, Joel Tetreault, Derrick Higgins, Aoife Cahill, and Martin Chodorow. 2013. TOEFL11: A corpus of non-native English. Technical report, Educational Testing Service.

- For **ICLE**, the citation is:
  > Sylviane Granger, Estelle Dagneaux, Fanny Meunier, International Corpus ofand Magali Paquot. 2009. Learner English (Version 2). Presses Universitaires deLouvain, Louvain-la-Neuve.

- For **FCE**, the citation is:
  > Helen Yannakoudakis, Ted Briscoe, and Ben Medlock. 2011. A new dataset and method for automatically grading ESOL texts. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 180a189, Portland, Oregon.

- For **ICCI**, the citation is:
  > Shinaichiro Ishikawa, 2011. A new horizon in learner corpus studies: The aim of the ICNALE project, pages3a11. University of Strathclyde Press, Glasgow, UK.

- For **ICANLE**, the citation is:
  > Shinaichiro Ishikawa, 2011. A new horizon in learner corpus studies: The aim of the ICNALE project, pages3a11. University of Strathclyde Press, Glasgow, UK.

- For **Lang-8**, the citation is:
  > Julian Brooke and Graeme Hirst. 2012b. Robust, lexicalized native language identification. In Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING a12).

- For **Indian corpora**, the citation is:
  > Bo Han, Paul Cook, and Timothy Baldwin. 2012. Geolocation prediction in social media data by finding location indicative words. In Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING a12).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
