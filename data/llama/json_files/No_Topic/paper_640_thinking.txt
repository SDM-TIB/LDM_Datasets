To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying Cleartext in Historical Ciphers" by Maria-Elena Gambardella, BeA ata Megyesi, Eva Pettersson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the DECODE database and the HistCorp platform, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the DECODE database and the HistCorp platform, which are used to create word-based and character-based language models.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the DECODE database, which contains a collection of almost 3000 ciphertexts and keys from Early Modern times in Europe.

In the **results section**, the authors describe the dataset used in their study, which consists of 214 documents in 8 different languages.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DECODE**, the citation is:
  > ASV.(2016a). Reproduced excerpt from the Vati-i. 1025, Segretario di Stato,https://de-can Secret Archive,Francia, doss. 117, DECODE link:crypt.org/decode Record ID 198.

- For **HistCorp**, the citation is:
  > Pettersson, E. and Megyesi, B. (2018). The HistCorpCollection of Historical Corpora and Resources. InProceedings of the Digital Humanities in the NordicCountries 3rd Conference, Helsinki, Finland, March.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
