To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEMI-SUPERVISED FEW-SHOT LEARNING WITH A CONTROLLED DEGREE OF TASK-ADAPTIVE CONDITIONING" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss few-shot learning and semi-supervised few-shot learning, but no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **miniImageNet**: A few-shot learning dataset.
2. **tieredImageNet**: A few-shot learning dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **miniImageNet**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For **tieredImageNet**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
