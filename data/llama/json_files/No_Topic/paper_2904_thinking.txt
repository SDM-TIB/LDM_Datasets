To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extracting Economic Signals from Central Bank Speeches" by Maximilian Ahrens and Michael McMahon, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of a supervised topic modeling approach to extract monetary policy signals from central bank speeches, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of incorporating central bank language into economic models and mention the use of the Greenbook dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Greenbook dataset**: This dataset contains numerical and text data from the Federal Reserve's Greenbook reports.
2. **Public speeches dataset**: This dataset contains textual transcripts of over 3000 speeches given by different central bank officials.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for the analysis.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Greenbook dataset**, the citation is:
  > Federal Reserve. (2013). Greenbook. Retrieved from <https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/greenbook/>

- For **Public speeches dataset**, the citation is:
  > Federal Reserve. (2013). Speeches. Retrieved from <https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/speeches/>

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
