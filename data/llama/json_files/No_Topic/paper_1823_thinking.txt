To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Language Technology for Closely Related Languages, Varieties and Dialects", I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the construction of two monolingual word alignment corpora for the Greater China Region (GCR).

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for word alignment corpora for languages with different scripts, such as Mandarin Chinese.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for construction of the GCR word alignment corpora.

The authors mention two datasets:

1. **Wikipedia**: used as a source for extracting sentence pairs.
2. **News website**: used as a source for extracting sentence pairs.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for construction of the GCR word alignment corpora.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Wikipedia**, the citation is:
  > No specific citation found

- For **News website**, the citation is:
  > No specific citation found

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
