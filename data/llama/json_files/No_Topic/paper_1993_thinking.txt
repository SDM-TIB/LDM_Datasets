To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DSC-IIT ISM at WNUT-2020 Task 2: Detection of COVID-19 informativetweets using RoBERTa" by Sirigireddy Dhanalaxmi, Rohit Agarwal, and Aman Sinha, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of models for the COVID-19 informativetweets task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of detecting informative COVID-19 English tweets, which implies the use of a dataset for this task.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named datasets:

1. **WNUT-2020 Task 2 dataset**: This dataset is used for the COVID-19 informativetweets classification task.
2. **Twitter dataset**: The authors mention that the dataset consists of 7000 and 1000 samples for training and validation, respectively, and 12000 tweets for testing.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WNUT-2020 Task 2 dataset**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For **Twitter dataset**, the authors mention that the dataset consists of 7000 and 1000 samples for training and validation, respectively, and 12000 tweets for testing.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
