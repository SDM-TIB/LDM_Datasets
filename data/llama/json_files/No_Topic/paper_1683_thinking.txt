To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning brain regions via large-scale online structured sparse dictionary-learning" by Elvis Dohmatob, Arthur Mensch, Gael Varoquaux, and Bertrand Thirion, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of brain imaging data, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of univariate models and the importance of multivariate models for brain imaging. They hint at the use of datasets for functional brain imaging.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset**: This dataset is used for functional brain imaging.
2. **fMRI data**: This dataset is used for functional brain imaging.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for the proposed method.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **HCP dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. van Essen et al. *The Human Connectome Project: A data acquisition perspective*. NeuroImage, 62, 2012.

- For **fMRI data**, the citation is:
  > R. Saxe, M. Brett, and N. Kanwisher. *Divide and conquer: a defense of functional localizers*. Neuroimage, 30, 2006.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
