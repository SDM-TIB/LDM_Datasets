To extract datasets from the research paper titled "APLenty: annotation tool for creating high-quality datasets using active and proactive learning" by Minh-Quoc Nghiem and Sophia Ananiadou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various datasets for sequence labeling tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing annotation tools and the importance of creating high-quality labeled datasets using active and proactive learning. They hint at the use of several datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **English CoNLL-2003 named entity dataset**: This dataset is used for named entity recognition tasks.
2. **JNLPBA corpus**: This corpus annotates proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
3. **CHEMDNER corpus**: This dataset is focused on annotating drugs and chemicals.
4. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: This dataset is used for gene recognition tasks.
5. **DUALIST**: This dataset is used for active learning annotation.
6. **Prodigy**: This dataset is used for commercial annotation.
7. **WebAnno**: This dataset is used for web-based annotation.
8. **PubAnnotation**: This dataset is used for web-based annotation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
