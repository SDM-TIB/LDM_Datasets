To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SemEval-2016 Task 7: Determining Sentiment Intensity of English and Arabic Phrases" by Svetlana Kiritchenko and Saif M. Mohammad, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the three tasks for sentiment intensity determination, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of sentiment intensity and the limitations of existing sentiment lexicons. They hint at the creation of new datasets for sentiment intensity determination.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named datasets:

1. **General English Sentiment Modifiers Set**: This dataset comprises English single words and multi-word phrases from the general domain.
2. **English Twitter Mixed Polarity Set**: This dataset focuses on English phrases made up of opposing polarity terms.
3. **Arabic Twitter Set**: This dataset includes single words and phrases commonly found in Arabic tweets.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the participating systems.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **General English Sentiment Modifiers Set**, the citation is:
  > Kiritchenko and Mohammad (2016b)

- For **English Twitter Mixed Polarity Set**, the citation is:
  > Kiritchenko and Mohammad (2016c)

- For **Arabic Twitter Set**, the citation is:
  > Mohammad et al. (2015)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
