    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "REPRESENTATION BALANCING OFFLINE MODEL-BASED REINFORCEMENT LEARNING" by Byung-Jun Lee, Jongmin Lee, and Kee-Eung Kim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representation learning for offline model-based reinforcement learning, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of offline model-based reinforcement learning and the need for representation learning that is robust to distribution shifts.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **D4RL benchmark datasets**: This dataset is used for evaluation of offline model-based reinforcement learning algorithms.
2. **MuJoCo benchmark datasets**: This dataset is used for evaluation of offline model-based reinforcement learning algorithms.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **D4RL benchmark datasets**, the citation is:
  > Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Oir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219, 2020.

- For **MuJoCo benchmark datasets**, the citation is:
  > Timothy P. Lillicrap, Jonathan J. Hunt, Alexander Pritzel, Nicolas Heess, Tom Erez, Yuval Tassa, David Silver, and Daan Wierstra. Continuous control with deep reinforcement learning. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
