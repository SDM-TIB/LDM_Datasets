To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WLSI-3/OIAF4HLT-2" by Yohei Murakami et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The paper mentions several datasets used in the workshop, including:

1. Kathaa
2. LAPPS/Galaxy
3. Model Investigator
4. Language Service ontology
5. Kachako API
6. CLARIN asWeblicht
7. Uyghur dependency Treebank
8. Universal dependencies for Uyghur
9. Vietnamese Speech Recognition System
10. Kaldi

Next, I will focus on the datasets that are explicitly mentioned as being used in the workshop, such as Kathaa, LAPPS/Galaxy, and Language Service ontology.

Now, I will check the references section to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Kathaa**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For **LAPPS/Galaxy**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For **Language Service ontology**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For **Kachako API**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For **CLARIN asWeblicht**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For **Uyghur dependency Treebank**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For **Universal dependencies for Uyghur**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For **Vietnamese Speech Recognition System**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For **Kaldi**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
