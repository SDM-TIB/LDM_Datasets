To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bypassing Optimization Complexity through Transfer Learning & DeepNeural Nets for Speech Intelligibility Improvement" by Ritujoy Biswas, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for speech intelligibility improvement, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of speech intelligibility and the limitations of existing methods. They hint at the evaluation of these methods on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **STOI (Speech Test Outcomes Index) dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating speech intelligibility.
2. **NOM (Noise-Only Mask) dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating noise robustness.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **STOI**, the citation is:
  > Cees H. Taal, Richard C. Hendriks, Richard Heusdens, and Jesper Jensen. *A short-time objective intelligibility measure for time-frequency weighted noisy speech*. In International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, pages 4214â€“4217, 2010.

- For **NOM**, the citation is:
  > Not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
