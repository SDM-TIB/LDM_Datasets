To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GEPSA, a tool for monitoring social challenges in digital press" by I Enaki San Vicente, Xabier Saralegi, Nerea Zubia, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various NLP techniques for analyzing social challenges, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of analyzing social challenges in digital press narratives, which implies the use of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **EIEC corpus**: A dataset used for evaluating the named entity recognition model.
2. **CONLL2003 dataset**: A dataset used for evaluating the named entity recognition model.
3. **Basque and Spanish language datasets**: Datasets used for training and evaluating the keyword extraction and sentiment analysis models.
4. **News datasets**: Datasets used for training and evaluating the thematic section classification model.
5. **Challenge datasets**: Datasets used for training and evaluating the social challenge classification model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **EIEC corpus**, the citation is:

- For **CONLL2003 dataset**, the citation is:
