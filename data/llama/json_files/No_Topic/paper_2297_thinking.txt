To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stylistic Approaches to Predicting Reddit Popularity in Diglossia" by Huikai Chua, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of data from the Singaporean and British subreddits, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of data from the Singaporean and British subreddits, but no specific dataset names are mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the use of data from the Singaporean and British subreddits, but no specific dataset names are mentioned.

In the **results section**, the authors mention the use of data from the Singaporean and British subreddits, but no specific dataset names are mentioned.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the Singaporean subreddit, the authors mention the use of data from the Pushshift API, but no specific dataset name is mentioned.
- For the British subreddit, the authors mention the use of data from the Pushshift API, but no specific dataset name is mentioned.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
