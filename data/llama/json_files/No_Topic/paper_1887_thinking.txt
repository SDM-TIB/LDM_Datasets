To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probe-Less Probing of BERT as Layer-Wise Linguistic Knowledge with Masked Word Prediction" by Tatsuya Aoyama, Nathan Schneider, and Nathan Schneider, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the analysis of BERT's layer-wise masked word prediction on an English corpus, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the current study's goal of analyzing BERT's layer-wise linguistic knowledge and its relation to probing studies. They mention the use of STREUSLE 4.4 corpus.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for analysis. Here, the authors mention the STREUSLE 4.4 corpus.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the STREUSLE 4.4 corpus was used for the analysis.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the STREUSLE 4.4 corpus:

- For STREUSLE 4.4, the citation is:
  > Nathan Schneider, Jena D. Hwang, Vivek Srikumar, Jakob Prange, Austin Blodgett, Sarah R. Moeller, Aviram Stern, Adi Bitan, and Omri Abend. Comprehensive supersense disambiguation of English prepositions and possessives. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 185a196, Melbourne, Australia. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
