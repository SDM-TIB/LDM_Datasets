To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discriminative Shape from Shading in Uncalibrated Illumination" by Stephan R. Richter, Stefan Roth, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the training and analysis of a large-scale dataset for training and analysis, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous work and the need for a large-scale dataset for training and analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and analysis. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MIT intrinsic image dataset**: This dataset is used for training and analysis.
2. **Synthetic dataset**: This dataset is used for training and analysis.
3. **3D models created by artists**: This dataset is used for training and analysis.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and analysis.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MIT intrinsic image dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Grosse, M. K. Johnson, E. H. Adelson, and W. T. Freeman. Ground truth dataset and baseline evaluations for intrinsic image algorithms. In ICCV, 2009.

- For **Synthetic dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Ben-Arie and D. Nandy. A neural network approach for reconstructing surface shape from shading. In ICIP, 1998.

- For **3D models created by artists**, the citation is:
  > Dosch Design.http://www.doschdesign.com/products/3d/Comic_Characters_V2.html.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
