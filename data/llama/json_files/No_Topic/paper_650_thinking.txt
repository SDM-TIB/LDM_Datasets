To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compositional Mechanisms of Japanese Numeral Classifiers" by Miho Mano, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the analysis of numeral classifiers, focusing on Japanese having various kinds of classifiers.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the requirements of match the classifiers and the quantified nouns, and mention that Huang and Ahrens (2003) explain the compositional mechanisms of classifiers and the quantified nouns using coercion instead of agreement.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for analysis. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Japanese counters**: A dataset containing about 360 counters in Japanese, divided into numeral classifiers and measure specifiers.
2. **Matsumoto (1991, 1993)**: A dataset containing semantic restrictions of Japanese classifiers.
3. **Downing (1996)**: A dataset containing semantic restrictions of Japanese classifiers.
4. **Iida (1999)**: A dataset containing semantic restrictions of Japanese classifiers.
5. **Nishimitsu and Mizuguchi (2004)**: A dataset containing semantic restrictions of Japanese classifiers.
6. **Kageyama et al. (2011)**: A dataset containing categorizations of Japanese counters.
7. **Huang and Ahrens (2003)**: A dataset containing analysis of Mandarin classifier system.
8. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: A dataset used for gene recognition tasks.
9. **JNLPBA corpus**: A corpus annotating proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
10. **CHEMDNER corpus**: A dataset focused on annotating drugs and chemicals.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
