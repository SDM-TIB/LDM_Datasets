To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mental Health Surveillance over Social Media with Digital Cohorts" by Silvio Amir, Mark Dredze and John W. Ayers, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the construction of a digital cohort of social media users and the analysis of mental health trends.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of tracking mental health conditions via social media and the need for representative samples of the underlying population.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Twitter users dataset**: A large sample of Twitter users randomly selected and processed with demographic inference techniques.
2. **CLPysch 2015 dataset**: A self-reported dataset created for CLPysch 2015, containing user-level data for depression and PTSD.
3. **NIH statistics dataset**: A dataset containing prevalence statistics for depression and PTSD from the National Institutes of Health.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for analysis.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Twitter users dataset**, no specific citation is mentioned.
- For **CLPysch 2015 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mitchell et al., 2015; Coppersmith et al., 2015b.
- For **NIH statistics dataset**, the citation is:
  > NIH reports (2003 and 2015 for depression and PTSD, respectively).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
