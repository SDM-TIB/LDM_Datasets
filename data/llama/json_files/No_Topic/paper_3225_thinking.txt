To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the First Conference on Machine Translation, Volume 2: Shared Task Papers, pages 499a504,Berlin, Germany, August 11-12, 2016. c2016 Association for Computational Linguistics" I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of machine translation outputs, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the evaluation of machine translation outputs using the character n-gram F-score (CHRF) and the word n-gram F-score (WORDF). They hint at the use of various datasets for this evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **WMT14 and WMT15 shared tasks datasets**: These datasets are used for the evaluation of machine translation systems.
2. **English, French, German, Czech, Russian, Hindi, and Finnish datasets**: These datasets are used for the evaluation of machine translation systems in different languages.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WMT14 and WMT15 shared tasks datasets**, the citation is:
  > Ondrej Bojar, Christian Buck, Christian Federmann,Barry Haddow, Philipp Koehn, Johannes Leveling,Christof Monz, Pavel Pecina, Matt Post, HerveSaint-Amand, Radu Soricut, Lucia Specia, and AleEsTamchyna. 2014. Findings of the 2014 workshopIn Proceedingson statistical machine translation.of the 9th Workshop on Statistical Machine Transla-tion (WMT-14), pages 12a58, Baltimore, Maryland,USA, June.
- For **English, French, German, Czech, Russian, Hindi, and Finnish datasets**, the citation is:
  > Ondrej Bojar, Rajen Chatterjee, Christian Federmann,Barry Haddow, Matthias Huck, Chris Hokamp,Philipp Koehn, Varvara Logacheva, Christof Monz,Matteo Negri, Matt Post, Carolina Scarton, LuciaSpecia, and Marco Turchi. 2015. Findings of the2015 workshop on statistical machine translation. InProceedings of the 10th Workshop on Statistical Ma-chine Translation (WMT-15), pages 1a46, Lisbon,Portugal, September.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
