To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Theory of Self-Supervised Framework for Few-Shot Learning" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the application of self-supervised learning to Few-shot learning (FSL), which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of supervised FSL methods and the suitability of self-supervised learning for FSL. They hint at the evaluation of self-supervised methods on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Omniglot**: A dataset of 1623 hand-written characters from 50 alphabets.
2. **miniImageNet**: A downsampled image subset of the large-scale ImageNet dataset, consisting of 100 classes with 600 RGB images of size 84 A 84 per class.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Omniglot**, the citation is:
  > Andrew Howard, Menglong Zhu, Jian Li, Trevor Piotts, Rob Girshick, and Alexander Szegedy. *Improving few-shot learning with attention and lower bounding*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 1123â€“1132, 2016.

- For **miniImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Oriol Vinyals, Charles Blundell, Tim Lillicrap, Daan Wierstra, and Andrew Coates. *Matching networks for one-shot learning*. In NIPS, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
