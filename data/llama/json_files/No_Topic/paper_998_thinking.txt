Histor-ically, this is the period in which many regis-ters of English developed, including the lan-guage of science. Our overarching interest isthe linguistic development of scientiic writ-ing to a distinctive (group of) register(s). Aregister is marked not only by the choice oflexical words (discourse domain) but cruciallyby grammatical choices which indicate style.The focus of the paper is on the latter, trac-ing words with primarily grammatical func-tions (function words and some selected, poly-functional word forms) diachronically. To thisend, we combine diachronic word embeddingswith appropriate visualization and exploratorytechniques such as clustering and relative en-tropy for meaningful aggregation of data anddiachronic comparison.1IntroductionWord embeddings are by now a well establishedinstrument for exploring and comparing corporain terms of lexical ields and semantic richness(Lenci, 2008). More recently, diachronic wordembeddings have been successfully applied to in-vestigate lexical semantic change (e.g. Jatowt andDuh (2014); Hamilton et al. (2016a); Hellrichand Hahn (2016); Fankhauser and Kupietz (2017);Hellrich et al. (2018)). We supplement this lineof work using diachronic word embeddings forthe analysis of change in grammatical use, po-tentially indicating shifts in style/register. Wordembeddings reiect shared usage contexts not onlyof lexical words but also of grammatical words.By grammatical words we understand functionwords (determiners, conjunctions, etc.) as wellas some other speciic word forms, such as wh-pronouns or ing-forms of verbs. Typically, thelatter are poly-functional (e.g. verbal ing-formscan be gerunds, participles or markers of presentcontinuous). Function words are high-frequencywords and affected by change only in the longterm (e.g. by becoming clitics or bound forms),while lexical words, typically in the lower fre-Ifquency band, tend to change (meaning) fast.pressure arises for grammar to change (e.g.formore economical expression), it will likely af-fect the poly-functional word forms irst, whichcan spread to new syntagmatic environments orattract new lexemes and extend paradigmatically(like lexical words, unlike function words). Tocapture such developments, we employ diachronicword embeddings with visualization of word clus-ters on a diachronic axis combined with someother exploratory techniques, such as clusteringand relative entropy. For instance, spread of aword/word form will result in the word movingin the overall embedding space, or paradigmaticextension will result in locally higher populate,denser spaces. Comparing lexical words, functionwords and poly-functional word forms, we inspectthe overall topology of the embedding space overtime as well as capture the internal composition of(selected) individual sub-spaces.As a data set we use the Royal Society Corpus(RSC) (Kermes et al., 2016), a diachronic corpusof the Philosophical Transactions and the Proceed-ings of the Royal Society of London, which in-cludes text material that is linguistically well ex-plored in terms of style, register and diachrony(e.g. Biber and Finegan (1997); Atkinson (1999);Banks (2008); Degaetano-Ortlieb et al. (2018)).Following related work (Section 2), we presentour data and methods (Section 3).

Zooming in on ing-forms, we also micro-inspect their (changing) syntagmatic contexts. Weconclude with a summary and future work direc-tions (Section 5).2 Related workQuantitative corpus-based approaches to language(2006); Geeraerts et al.change (e.g. Hilpert(2011); Sagi et al. (2011); Hilpert and Gries(2016)) share the basic assumption that languageuse is governed by statistical properties of lexicaland grammatical items. In recent years, distribu-tional semantic approaches based on word embed-dings, often combined with clustering, capture thisassumption in a bottom-up fashion, allowing tomodel semantic similarity of words from corpora.Approaches such as word2vec (Mikolov et al.,2013) and SVD PPMI (Levy and Goldberg, 2014;Levy et al., 2015) trained on corpora covering sev-eral time spans allow investigating changes in thesemantic usage of lexical items over time (Jatowtand Duh, 2014; Kim et al., 2014; Kulkarni et al.,2015; Hamilton et al., 2016a; Hellrich and Hahn,2016). To also capture syntactic information, ap-proaches have been developed that account forword order based on structured skip-gram models(Ling et al., 2015) and clustering the model output(Dubossarsky et al., 2015; Fankhauser and Kupi-etz, 2017).Particularly targeted at the digital humanities aswell as socio-historical corpus-linguistics are ap-proaches which also allow meaningful ways toinspect the data. For instance, Hellrich et al.(2018) provide a visualization website (JeSemE)to inspect change in word meaning over time bymeans of line and bar plots considering differ-ent comparative parameters (word similarity, wordemotion, typical context, and relative frequency);Fankhauser and Kupietz (2017) provide a visual-ization of change in the distributional semantics ofwords combined with their relative frequency overtime.3 Data and Methods3.1 DataAs a data set we use v4.0 of the Royal SocietyCorpus (RSC)1, containing the publications of thePhilosophical Transactions and Proceedings of the1Availableopensourceathttp://fedora.clarin-d.uni-saarland.de/rsc_v4/Royal Society of London from 1665 to 1869 (ca.32 million tokens and 10,000 documents).

(2015) witha one-hot encoding for words as input layer, a200-dimensional hidden layer, and a window of[-5,5] as the output layer. Importantly, as this ap-proach takes into account word order, it will cap-ture grammatical patterns in word usage.Word embeddings are calculated for eachdecade of the RSC. The embeddings for the irstdecade are initialized with a irst-run training onthe whole corpus, and subsequently reined foreach decade of the 20 decades taken into consid-eration (1670a1860). The vocabulary of the mod-els consists of a total of 117.165 100-dimensionalpoints. The vocabulary consists only of aspacedatokens (i.e. divided by space or punctuation inthe original text). Multiword expressions andphrases are not taken into account, to maintain theoriginal modelling as agnostic as possible aboutthe content of the corpus.
