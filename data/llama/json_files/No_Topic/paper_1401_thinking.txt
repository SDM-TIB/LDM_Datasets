To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AOD-Net: All-in-One Dehazing Network" by Boyi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the AOD-Net model on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of dehazing and the limitations of previous methods. They hint at the evaluation of the AOD-Net model on synthetic and natural haze images.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Middlebury stereo database**: This dataset is used for evaluating the AOD-Net model on synthetic haze images.
2. **NYU2 Depth Database**: This dataset is used for evaluating the AOD-Net model on synthetic haze images.
3. **Challenging Real Photos**: This dataset is used for evaluating the AOD-Net model on natural haze images.
4. **Pascal VOC 2007 dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the AOD-Net model on object detection tasks with haze.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of the AOD-Net model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Middlebury stereo database**, the citation is:
  > S. I. Seitz, B. M. Pelikka, and R. Szeliski. A comparison of stereo vision algorithms from structure from motion. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 31(5):730–744, 2009.

- For **NYU2 Depth Database**, the citation is:
  > L. Silberman, D. Hoiem, P. Kohli, and R. Fergus. Indoor segmentation from depth. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 351–358, 2012.

- For **Challenging Real Photos**, the citation is:
  > R. Fattal. Single image dehazing. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 27(3):72, 2008.

- For **Pascal VOC 2007 dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2007 (VOC2007) Results. http://www.pascal-network.org/challenges/VOC/voc2007/workshop/index.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
