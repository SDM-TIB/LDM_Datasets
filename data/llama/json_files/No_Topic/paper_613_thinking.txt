To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On learning to refer to things based on discriminative properties" by Angeliki Lazaridou, Nghia The Pham, and Marco Baroni, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the biomedical domain, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of word2vec and the importance of character-based representations like fastText. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Visual Attributes for Concepts Dataset (ViSA)**: This dataset contains per-concept (as opposed to per-image) attributes for 500 concrete concepts (CAT, SOFA, MILK) spanning across different categories (MAMMALS, FURNITURE), annotated with 636 general attributes.
2. **Discriminative Attribute Dataset**: This dataset is generated from the ViSA dataset, consisting of pairs of (intended) referents and contexts, with respect to which the referents should be identified by their distinctive attributes.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ViSA**, the citation is:
  > Silberer et al. (2013) Models of semantic representation with visual attributes. In Proceedings of ACL, pages 572a582, Soia, Bulgaria.

- For **Discriminative Attribute Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not explicitly mentioned, but it is generated from the ViSA dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
