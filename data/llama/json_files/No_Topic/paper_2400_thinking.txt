To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UNSUPERVISED CONTINUAL LEARNING AND SELF-TAUGHT ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY HIERARCHIES" by James Smith, Seth Baer, Zsolt Kira & Constantine Dovrolis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the MNIST dataset, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the UCL problem and the use of the MNIST dataset for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the MNIST dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the MNIST dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset:

- For MNIST, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, and P. Haffner. Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278a2324, Nov 1998.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
