To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Construction of English-French Multimodal Affective Conversational Corpus from TV Dramas" by Sashi Novitasari et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the construction of a multimodal affective conversational corpus based on TV dramas, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets for affective conversation and the importance of constructing a new corpus.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for construction. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **HUMAINE Database**: A multimodal corpus that consists of natural and induced data showing emotion in a range of contexts.
2. **SEMAINE Database**: An emotion-rich conversational database, which was carefully constructed by recording interactions between a sensitive artificial listener (SAL) and users.
3. **BTEC (ATR basic travel expression corpus)**: A corpus that serves as the primary source for developing broad-coverage speech translation systems.
4. **Formosa Speech Database**: A multilingual corpus for Taiwanese-Hakka-Mandarin, created by recording 49 hours of speech.
5. **Multi30K Database**: A corpus from Multilingual English-German Image Descriptions, created for a WMT Shared Task of Multimodal Machine Translation.
6. **Flickr30K Entities dataset**: A dataset used as the basis for the Multi30K Database.
7. **Conversation dialog corpus from movies and television**: A corpus constructed to provide transcriptions of natural conversations of humans since the recording and transcription of actual human-to-human conversations are tedious and time-consuming.
8. **Large-scale multimodal movie dialogue corpus**: A corpus constructed from movies, containing 149,689 dialogue segments from 1,722 movies.
9. **TV-series data**: A dataset constructed from American TV dramas, containing parallel English-French language in lexical, acoustic, and facial features.
