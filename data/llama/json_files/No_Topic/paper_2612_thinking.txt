To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Prediction of Morphosemantic Relations" by Svetla Koeva, Svetlozara Leseva, Ivelina Stoyanova, Tsvetana Dimitrova, and Maria Todorova, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the morphosemantic relations, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing MSR datasets and the importance of developing a machine learning method for automatic identification and classification of morphosemantic relations. They hint at the use of the Prince-ton WordNet (PWN) and the Bulgarian WordNet (BulNet).

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **PWN**: The Prince-ton WordNet, which is used as a source for MSR instances.
2. **BulNet**: The Bulgarian WordNet, which is used as a source for MSR instances.
3. **MSR dataset**: A dataset containing morphosemantic relations between verb and noun synset pairs in the Bulgarian WordNet.
4. **Negative examples dataset**: A dataset containing examples of derivationally related verb-noun literal pairs that do not have an MSR.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PWN**, the citation is:
  > Fellbaum, C. (2009). Putting semantics into WordNet. In Proceedings of the 2009 Conference on Human Language Technology and Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 1-8).

- For **BulNet**, the citation is:
  > Koeva, S. (2008). Derivational and morphosemantic relations in Bulgarian Wordnet. Intelligent Information Systems, 359-368.

- For **MSR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dimitrova, T., Tarpomanova, E., Rizov, B., & Koeva, S. (2014). Automatic semantic filtering of morphosemantic relations in WordNet.

- For **Negative examples dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dimitrova, T., Tarpomanova, E., Rizov, B., & Koeva, S. (2014). Automatic semantic filtering of morphosemantic relations in WordNet.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
