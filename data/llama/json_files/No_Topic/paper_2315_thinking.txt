To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On shape classifiers, their metaphorical extension(s) and wordnet potentials" by Francesca Quattri, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the introduction of shape information in wordnets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the complexity of Chinese shape classifiers and their metaphorical implications. They hint at the exploration of these classifiers in wordnets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CEDICT**, the citation is:
  > http://cdict.net/

- For **Hantology**, the citation is:
  > http://hantology.sinica.edu.tw/

- For **Mandarin Daily Dictionary of Chinese Classifiers**, the citation is:
  > Chu-Ren Huang, Ke-Jiann Chen and Ching-Hsiung Lai (eds.). 1997. Mandarin Daily Dictionary of Chinese Classifiers. MandarinDaily Press, Taipei, Taiwan.

- For **SUMO**, the citation is:
  > http://www.ontologyupperontologyportal.com/

- For **WordNet**, the citation is:
  > http://wordnet.princeton.edu/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
