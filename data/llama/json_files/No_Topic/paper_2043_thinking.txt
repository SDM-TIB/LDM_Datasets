To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 1986a1997,Berlin, Germany, August 7-12, 2016. c2016 Association for Computational Linguistics" by Silvio Cordeiro, Carlos Ramisch, Marco Idiart, and Aline Villavicencio, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of distributional semantic models (DSMs) for predicting the compositionality of nominal compounds on 4 datasets for English and French.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of DSMs and the importance of evaluating them on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Reddy**: A dataset containing compositionality judgments for 90 compounds and their individual word components.
2. **Reddy++**: An extension of the Reddy dataset with an additional 90 English nominal compounds.
3. **Farahmand**: A dataset containing binary non-compositionality judgments for 1042 English compounds.
4. **FR-comp**: A dataset containing adjective-noun and noun-adjective compounds in French.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Reddy**, the citation is:
  > Siva Reddy, Diana McCarthy, and Suresh Manandhar. *An empirical study on compositionality in compound nouns*. In Proceedings of The 5th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing 2011 (IJCNLP 2011), Chiang Mai, Thailand, November.

- For **Reddy++**, the citation is:
  > Carlos Ramisch, Silvio Cordeiro, Leonardo Zilio, Marco Idiart, Aline Villavicencio, and Rodrigo Wilkens. *How naked is the naked truth?* A multilingual lexicon of nominal compound compositionality. In Proc. of the 55th ACL (Volume 2:Short Papers), Berlin, Germany, Aug. ACL.

- For **Farahmand**, the citation is:
  > Meghdad Farahmand, Aaron Smith, and Joakim Nivre. *A multiword expression data set: Annotating non-compositionality and conventionalization for English noun compounds*. In Proceedings of the 11th Workshop on Multiword Expressions, pages 29a33, Denver, Colorado, June.

- For **FR-comp**, the citation is:
  > Carlos Ramisch, Silvio Cordeiro, Leonardo Zilio, Marco Idiart, Aline Villavicencio, and Rodrigo Wilkens. *How naked is the naked truth?* A multilingual lexicon of nominal compound compositionality. In Proc. of the 55th ACL (Volume 2:Short Papers), Berlin, Germany, Aug. ACL.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
