To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Warp to the Future: Joint Forecasting of Features and Feature Motion" by Josip ESariA c1Marin OrEsiA c1TonA ci AntunoviA c2Sacha VraEziA c2SiniEsa ESegviA c11Faculty of Electrical Engineering and ComputingUniversity of Zagreb, Croatia2Rimac AutomobiliSveta Nedelja, CroatiaAbstractWe address anticipation of scene development by fore-casting semantic segmentation of future frames. Severalprevious works approach this problem by F2F (feature-to-feature) forecasting where future features are regressedfrom observed features. Different from previous work,we consider a novel F2M (feature-to-motion) formulation,which performs the forecast by warping observed featuresaccording to regressed feature iow. This formulation mod-els a causal relationship between the past and the future,and regularizes inference by reducing dimensionality of theforecasting target. However, emergence of future scenerywhich was not visible in observed frames can not be ex-plained by warping. We propose to address this issue bycomplementing F2M forecasting with the classic F2F ap-proach. We realize this idea as a multi-head F2MF modelbuilt atop shared features. Experiments show that the F2Mhead prevails in static parts of the scene while the F2F headkicks-in to ill-in the novel regions. The proposed F2MFmodel operates in synergy with correlation features andoutperforms all previous approaches both in short-term andmid-term forecast on the Cityscapes dataset.
