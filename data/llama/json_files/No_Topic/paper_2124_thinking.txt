To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Search-Oriented Conversational AI" by various authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of models for search-oriented conversational systems, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of search-oriented conversational systems and the need for evaluation metrics. They hint at the use of various datasets for training and testing models.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Neural Response Ranking for Social Conversation: A Data-Eficient Approach**: This dataset is used for training and testing models for social conversation.
2. **Autonomous Sub-domain Modeling for Dialogue Policy with Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning**: This dataset is used for training and testing models for dialogue policy.
3. **Building Dialogue Structure from Discourse Tree of a Question**: This dataset is used for training and testing models for dialogue structure.
4. **A Methodology for Evaluating Interaction Strategies of Task-Oriented Conversational Agents**: This dataset is used for training and testing models for task-oriented conversational agents.
5. **A Reinforcement Learning-driven Translation Model for Search-Oriented Conversational Systems**: This dataset is used for training and testing models for search-oriented conversational systems.
6. **Research Challenges in Building a Voice-based Artiicial Personal Shopper - Position Paper**: This dataset is used for training and testing models for voice-based personal shoppers.
7. **Curriculum Learning Based on Reward Sparseness for Deep Reinforcement Learning of Task Completion**: This dataset is used for training and testing models for task completion.
8. **Data Augmentation for Neural Online Chats Response Selection**: This dataset is used for training and testing models for neural online chat response selection.
9. **A Knowledge-Grounded Multimodal Search-Based Conversational Agent**: This dataset is used for training and testing models for multimodal search-based conversational agents.
10. **Embedding Individual Table Columns for Resilient SQL Chatbots**: This dataset is used for training and testing models for resilient SQL chatbots.
11. **Exploring Named Entity Recognition As an Auxiliary Task for Slot Filling in Conversational Language**: This dataset is used for training and testing models for named entity recognition and slot filling.
12. **Why are Sequence-to-Sequence Models So Dull? Understanding the Low-Diversity Problem of Chatbots**: This dataset is used for training and testing models for chatbots.
