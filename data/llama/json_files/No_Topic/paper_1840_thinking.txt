To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-life, French-accented Corpus of Air Traffic Control Communications" by Estelle Delpech et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the creation of the AIRBUS-ATC corpus, which is a real-life, French-accented speech corpus of Air Traffic Control (ATC) communications.

In the **introduction**, the authors describe the corpus and its intended use for building a robust ATC speech recognition engine.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for the corpus. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **ATCOSIM**: A small corpus containing various non-native accents.
2. **HIWIRE**: A noisy and non-native English speech corpus for cockpit communication.
3. **NIST Air Traffic Control Corpus**: A large corpus of real-life ATC from 3 different US airports.
4. **FISHER**: A corpus of spoken language, including everyday topics and standard language.
5. **SWITCHBOARD**: A voluminous dataset of conversational speech.
6. **VOCALISE**: A military ATC corpus.
7. **Lopez et al. corpus**: A corpus of real-life French-accented civil ATC.
8. **AIRBUS-ATC corpus**: The dataset being described in the paper.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
