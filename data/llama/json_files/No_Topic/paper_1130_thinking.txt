To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SIGDIAL 2019" by various authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **program and committee listings** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The program and committee listings mention several datasets used in the conference, including:

* TDDiscourse: A Dataset for Discourse-Level Temporal Ordering of Events
* T2B: A Dataset for Task-to-Dialogue Alignment
* DIAL-OUT: A Dataset for Dialogue Systems
* DIAL-IN: A Dataset for Dialogue Systems
* DIAL-OUT: A Dataset for Dialogue Systems
* DIAL-IN: A Dataset for Dialogue Systems

In the **table of contents**, I found the following datasets:

* Deep Reinforcement Learning For Modeling Chit-Chat Dialog With Discrete Attributes
* Improving Interaction Quality Estimation with BiLSTMs and the Impact on Dialogue Policy Learning
* Lifelong and Interactive Learning of Factual Knowledge in Dialogues
* Few-Shot Dialogue Generation Without Annotated Data: A Transfer Learning Approach
