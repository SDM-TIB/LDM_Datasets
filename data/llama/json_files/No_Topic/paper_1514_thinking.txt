To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 131a136, Soia, Bulgaria, August 4-9 2013. c2013 Association for Computational Linguistics131A Decade of Automatic Content Evaluation of News Summaries:Reassessing the State of the Art" by Peter A. Rankel et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of automatic content metrics for news summary evaluation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of ROUGE metrics and the importance of assessing the ability of automatic evaluations to identify statistically significant differences.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Text Analysis Conference (TAC) evaluations, 2008-2011**: This dataset is used for evaluating automatic summarization systems.
2. **ROUGE metrics**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of ROUGE variants.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **TAC evaluations**, the citation is:
  > Ani Nenkova, Rebecca J. Passonneau, and Kathleen McKeown. 2007. The pyramid method: Incorporating human content selection variation in summarization evaluation. TSLP, 4(2).
- For **ROUGE metrics**, the citation is:
  > Chin-Yew Lin. 2004. ROUGE: A package for automatic evaluation of summaries. In Stan Szpakowicz, Marie-Francine Moens, editor, Text Summarization Branches Out: Proceedings of the ACL-04 Workshop, pages 74â€“81, Barcelona, Spain, July. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
