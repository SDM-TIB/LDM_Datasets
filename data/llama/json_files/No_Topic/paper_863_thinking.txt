To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Annotated Social Media Corpus for German Hate Speech research" by Eckhard Bick, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the compilation, pseudonymization, and grammatical annotation of the corpus, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of reliable data, actionable definitions, and linguistic research for hate speech filtering. They also mention the XPEROHS project, which involves collecting data from Twitter and Facebook.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **XPEROHS corpus**: A large corpus of German and Danish tweets and comments.
2. **German Twitter corpus**: A subset of the XPEROHS corpus, containing 1.7 million tweets.
3. **German Facebook corpus**: A subset of the XPEROHS corpus, containing 200 million comments.
4. **German-English section of the Europarl Parallel corpus**: Used for aligning noun phrases and phrases.
5. **German Twitter data**: Used for training and evaluation of the parser.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **XPEROHS corpus**, the citation is:

(ed.): RASK -International Journal of Language and Communication.Vol. 50., pp. 87-108. University of Southern Denmark.

- For **German Twitter corpus**, the citation is:

- For **German Facebook corpus**, the citation is:

- For **German-English section of the Europarl Parallel corpus**, the citation is:
  > Koehn, Ph., Knight, K. (2003). Empirical Methods forCompounds Splitting. In: Proceedings of EACL 2003(Budapest). ACL. pp. 187-193.

- For **German Twitter data**, the citation is:

In: Paul Cook et al.(ed.): Proceedings of the 10th Web as CorpusWorkshop (WAC-X) and the EmpiriST Shared Task.pp. 44-56. Berlin: Association for ComputationalLinguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
