To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lightweight Word-Level Conidence Estimation for Neural Interactive Translation Prediction" by Rebecca Knowles and Philipp Koehn, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of neural machine translation models and the importance of conidence estimation in interactive translation prediction, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous systems and the potential of conidence estimation in interactive translation prediction. They hint at the use of existing datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the use of WMT 2016 test data for training and development, and WMT 2017 test data for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For WMT 2016 test data, the citation is:
  > Sennrich et al. (2016) for the following language pairs and directions:
    - English-German (en-de)
    - German-English (de-en)
    - English-Czech (en-cs)
    - Czech-English (cs-en)

- For WMT 2017 test data, the citation is:
  > Sennrich et al. (2017) for the following language pairs and directions:
    - English-German (en-de)
    - German-English (de-en)
    - English-Czech (en-cs)
    - Czech-English (cs-en)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
