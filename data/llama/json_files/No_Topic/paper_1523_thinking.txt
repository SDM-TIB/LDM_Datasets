To extract datasets from the research paper titled "L2-Net: Deep Learning of Discriminative Patch Descriptor in Euclidean Space" by Yurun Tian, Bin Fan, and Fuchao Wu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the Brown and Oxford datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the research focus on designing local patch descriptors and the use of Brown and Oxford datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Brown dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the proposed L2-Net model.
2. **Oxford dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the proposed L2-Net model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Brown dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Brown, G. Hua, and S. A. G. Winder. Discriminative learning of local image descriptors. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2010.

- For **Oxford dataset**, the citation is:
  > K. Mikolajczyk and C. Schmid. A performance evaluation of local descriptors. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2003.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
