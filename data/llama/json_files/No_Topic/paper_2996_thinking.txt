To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Causal Investigation of Public Opinion during the COVID-19 Pandemic via Social Media Text" by Michael Jantscher, Roman Kern, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of NLP methods in combination with methods from economics and social sciences, and the authors discuss the analysis of sentiment analysis of Tweets toward the current COVID-19 situation in the UK and Sweden.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of understanding public opinion during a pandemic and the use of social media text as a proxy for public opinion.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Twitter dataset**: A geotagged Twitter dataset used for sentiment analysis and topic modeling.
2. **COVID-19Data Repository**: A dataset containing reported COVID-19 cases and deaths from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.
3. **Google Mobility Reports**: A dataset capturing movement trends over different categories relative to a predefined baseline.
4. **COVID-19 Government ResponseTracker**: A dataset capturing policies related to closure and containment, health, and economic measures across countries and national and subnational jurisdictions.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for analysis.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Twitter dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gupta et al. (2021) collected COVID-19 related Tweet IDs and performed sentiment analysis and LDA topic modeling.

- For **COVID-19Data Repository**, the citation is:
  > Dong et al. (2020) gathered data on reported COVID-19 cases and deaths.

- For **Google Mobility Reports**, the citation is:
  > Google Mobility (2020) provides a dataset capturing movement trends.

- For **COVID-19 Government ResponseTracker**, the citation is:
  > Hale et al. (2021) developed the COVID-19 Government ResponseTracker.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
