To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating GAN-Based Image Augmentation for Threat Detection in Large-Scale X-ray Security Images" by Joanna Kazzandra Dumagpi and Yong-Jin Jeong, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the SIXray dataset for threat detection, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of prior studies on X-ray security images and the importance of addressing the class imbalance problem. They mention the SIXray dataset as a large-scale and imbalanced X-ray security image dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SIXray dataset**: This dataset is used for threat detection and is described as a large-scale and imbalanced X-ray security image dataset.
2. **SIXray10, SIXray100, and SIXray1000 subsets**: These subsets are mentioned as being used for evaluation of the threat detection model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the SIXray dataset was used for evaluation of the threat detection model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SIXray dataset:

- For **SIXray dataset**, the citation is:
  > Miao, C.; Xie, L.; Wan, F.; Su, C.; Liu, H.; Jiao, J.; Ye, Q. SIXray: A Large-scale Security Inspection X-ray Benchmark for Prohibited Item Discovery in Overlapping Images. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Long Beach, CA, USA, 15a20 June 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
