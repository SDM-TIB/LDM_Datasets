To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modality-Agnostic Learning for Radar-Lidar Fusion in Vehicle Detection" by Yu-Jhe Li, Jinhyung Park, Matthew OaToole, and Kris Kitani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset, which suggests that this dataset is likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing Lidar-Radar fusion models and the importance of addressing the issue of missing sensors during inference. They hint at the evaluation of their proposed model on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the Oxford Radar Robotcar (ORR) dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the ORR dataset was used for evaluation of their proposed model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ORR dataset:

- For the ORR dataset, the citation is:
  > Dan Barnes, Matthew Gadd, Paul Murcutt, Paul Newman, and Ingmar Posner. *The Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset: AIn 2020radar extension to the Oxford robotcar dataset*. IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 6433â€“6438, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA.2020.9197493

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
