To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SELFISH EMERGENT COMMUNICATIONAnonymous authorsPaper under double-blind reviewABSTRACTCurrent literature in machine learning holds that unaligned, self-interested agentsdo not learn to use an emergent communication channel. We introduce a newsender-receiver game to study emergent communication for this spectrum ofpartially-competitive scenarios and put special care into evaluation. We ind thatcommunication can indeed emerge in partially-competitive scenarios, and we dis-cover three things that are tied to improving it. First, that selish communication isproportional to cooperation, and it naturally occurs for situations that are more co-operative than competitive. Second, that stability and performance are improvedby using LOLA (Foerster et al., 2018a), especially in more competitive scenarios.And third, that discrete protocols lend themselves better to learning cooperativecommunication than continuous ones.
