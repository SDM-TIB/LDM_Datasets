To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CTAP for Italian: Integrating Components for the Analysis of Italian into a Multilingual Linguistic Complexity Analysis Tool" by Nadezda Okinina, Jennifer-Carmen Frey, and Zarah Weiss, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the extension of the CTAP tool to support Italian, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of linguistic complexity research and the need for a comprehensive tool for analyzing Italian texts.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **De Mauro dictionary of basic Italian**: This dataset is used for lexical sophistication features.
2. **SUBTLEX-IT**: This dataset is used for lexical sophistication features.
3. **Google Books 2012**: This dataset is used for lexical sophistication features.
4. **Italian Wikipedia**: This dataset is used for familiarity features.
5. **Tint 0.2**: This dataset is used for part-of-speech tagging and syntactic analysis.
6. **Lingua::IT:Hyphenate**: This dataset is used for syllable annotation.
7. **Coease**: This dataset is used for text complexity analysis.
8. **READ-IT**: This dataset is used for text complexity analysis.
9. **Tint 2.0**: This dataset is used for text complexity analysis.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of the CTAP tool, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **De Mauro dictionary of basic Italian**, the citation is:
  > De Mauro, T. (2016). Il Nuovo vocabolario di base della italiana. https://dizionario.internazionale.it/nuovovocabolariodibase

- For **SUBTLEX-IT**, the citation is:
  > Crepaldi, D., Amenta, S., Mandera, P., Keuleers, E., Brysbaert, M. (2015). SUBTLEX-IT. Subtitle-based Word Frequency Estimates for Italian. Annual Meeting of the Italian Association for Experimental Psychology.

- For **Google Books 2012**, the citation is:

- For **Italian Wikipedia**, the citation is:
  > (no specific citation found)

- For **Tint 0.2**, the citation is:
  > Aprosio, A. P. and Moretti, G. (2016). Italy goes to Stanford: a collection of CoreNLP modules for Italian.

- For **Lingua::IT:Hyphenate**, the citation is:
  > Calpini, A. (no specific citation found)

- For **Coease**, the citation is:
  > Tonelli, S., Manh, K. T., Pianta, E. (2012). Making Readability Indices Readable. NAACL-HLT 2012 Workshop on Predicting and Improving Text Readability for target reader populations.

- For **READ-IT**, the citation is:
  > DellaOrletta, F. (2009). Ensemble system for Part-of-Speech tagging. Proceedings of Evalitaa09.

- For **Tint 2.0**, the citation is:
  > Aprosio, A. P. and Moretti, G. (2018). Tint 2.0: An All-inclusive Suite for NLP in Italian.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
