To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Demo Application for the AutoGOAL Framework" by Suilan Estevez-Velarde et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of AutoGOAL on several machine learning problems, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing AutoML tools and the importance of combining resources from different frameworks. They hint at the use of various datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Haha**: A dataset for text classification.
2. **ML-Plan**: A dataset for machine learning pipeline optimization.
3. **Weka**: A dataset for classification tasks.
4. **Sklearn**: A dataset for classification tasks.
5. **TPOT**: A dataset for pipeline optimization.
6. **Auto-Sklearn**: A dataset for classification tasks.
7. **Auto-WEKA**: A dataset for classification tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of AutoGOAL.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Haha**, the citation is:
  > Luis Chiruzzo, S Castro, Mathias Etcheverry, Diego Garat, Juan JosA e Prada, and Aiala RosA a. 2019. Overview ofhaha at iberlef 2019: Humor analysis based on human annotation.

- For **ML-Plan**, the citation is:
  > Felix Mohr, Marcel Wever, and Eyke HA ullermeier. 2018. ML-Plan: Automated machine learning via hierarchicalplanning. Machine Learning, 107(8):1495a1515, sep.

- For **Weka**, the citation is:

- For **Sklearn**, the citation is:
  > Frank Hutter, Lars Kotthoff, and Joaquin Vanschoren, editors. 2018. Automated Machine Learning: Methods,Systems, Challenges. Springer. In press, available at http://automl.org/book.

- For **TPOT**, the citation is:
  > Randal S Olson and Jason H Moore. 2016. Tpot: A tree-based pipeline optimization tool for automating machinelearning. In Workshop on Automatic Machine Learning, pages 66a74.

- For **Auto-Sklearn**, the citation is:
  > Matthias Feurer, Aaron Klein, Katharina Eggensperger, Jost Springenberg, Manuel Blum, and Frank Hutter. 2015.Eficient and robust automated machine learning. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages2962a2970.

- For **Auto-WEKA**, the citation is:
  > Chris Thornton, Frank Hutter, Holger H Hoos, and Kevin Leyton-Brown. 2013. Auto-WEKA: Combined selec-tion and hyperparameter optimization of classiication algorithms. In Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDDinternational conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, pages 847a855. ACM.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
