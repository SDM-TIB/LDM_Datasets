To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Facial Emotion Distribution Learningby Exploiting Low-Rank Label Correlations Locally" by Xiuyi Jia, Xiang Zheng, Weiwei Li, Changqing Zhang, and Zechao Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the facial expression recognition problem, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous facial expression recognition methods and the importance of multi-label learning for facial expression recognition. They hint at the evaluation of these methods on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **s-JAFFE**: A facial expression recognition dataset containing 213 grayscale images of 10 Japanese female models.
2. **SBU 3DFE**: A facial expression recognition dataset containing 2500 images.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their method, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **s-JAFFE**, the citation is:
  > M. Lyons, S. Akamatsu, M. Kamachi, and J. Gyoba. Coding facial expressions with Gabor wavelets. In Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, pages 200-205, 2002.

- For **SBU 3DFE**, the citation is:
  > L. Yin, X. Wei, Y. Sun, J. Wang, and M. J. Rosato. A 3D facial expression database for facial behavior research. In Proceedings of the 2006 International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, pages 211-216, 2006.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
