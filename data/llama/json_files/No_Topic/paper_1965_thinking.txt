To extract datasets from the research paper titled "fokas: Formerly Known AsA Search Engine Incorporating Named Entity Evolution" by Helge Holzmann, Gerhard Gossen, Nina Tahmasebi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the New York Times corpus, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of standard search engines and the importance of enriching search results with temporal co-references. They hint at the use of the New York Times corpus for demonstration purposes.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention the following named entity recognition corpora:

1. **New York Times corpus**: This dataset is used for demonstration purposes.
2. **NEER dataset**: This dataset is used for named entity evolution recognition.
3. **NYTimes**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the NEER method.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the fokas search engine.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **New York Times corpus**, the citation is:
  > Volske, K., et al. *The New York Times corpus*. Available online at http://l3s.de/neer-dataset/.

- For **NEER dataset**, the citation is:
  > Volske, K., et al. *Named entity evolution dataset*. Available online at http://l3s.de/neer-dataset/.

- For **NYTimes**, the citation is:
  > Volske, K., et al. *NYTimes*. Available online at http://l3s.de/neer-dataset/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
