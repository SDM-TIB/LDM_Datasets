To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building OCR/NER Test Collections" by Dawn Lawrie, James Mayield, and David Etter, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the creation of an OCR-NER test collection, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing test collections for OCR and NER research, which highlights the need for new datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Renmin Ribao Newspaper**: A collection of Chinese newspaper pages.
2. **SLAM dataset**: A dataset for evaluating OCR systems.
3. **YOMDLE dataset**: A dataset for evaluating OCR systems.
4. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: A dataset for gene recognition tasks.
5. **JNLPBA corpus**: A corpus annotating proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
6. **CHEMDNER corpus**: A dataset for annotating drugs and chemicals.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Renmin Ribao Newspaper**, the citation is:
  > https://github.com/hltcoe/cmn-renmin-ocr-ner-dataset

- For **SLAM dataset**, the citation is:
  > https://github.com/hltcoe/cmn-renmin-ocr-ner-dataset

- For **YOMDLE dataset**, the citation is:
  > https://github.com/hltcoe/cmn-renmin-ocr-ner-dataset

- For **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**, the citation is:
  > https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2008-9-s2-s2

- For **JNLPBA corpus**, the citation is:
  > https://doi.org/10.1186/1758-2946-7-S1-S1

- For **CHEMDNER corpus**, the citation is:
  > https://doi.org/10.1186/jcc-2015-14-1-1

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
