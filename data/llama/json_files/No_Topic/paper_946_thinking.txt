To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparative Graph-based Summarization of Scientific Papers Guided by Comparative Citations" by Jingqiang Chen, Chaoxiang Cai, Xiaorui Jiang, and Kejia Chen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the construction of a comparative citation-guided dataset and the use of CSSC for scientific papers.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of comparative citations in finding related and comparable articles and common topics for comparative summaries.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset construction section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for annotation and collection. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CSSC (Comparative Scientific Summarization Corpus)**: This dataset is constructed based on comparative citations and contains 40 groups of comparable scientific papers and corresponding reference summaries.
2. **DUC2006 and DUC2007**: These datasets are used for multi-document summarization tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their comparative graph-based summarization method.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CSSC**, the citation is:
  > Jingqiang Chen, Chaoxiang Cai, Xiaorui Jiang, and Kejia Chen. *Comparative Graph-based Summarization of Scientific Papers Guided by Comparative Citations*. Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pages 5978-5988, 2022. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/W22-3701

- For **DUC2006 and DUC2007**, the citations are:
  > DUC2006: https://www.duc.edu/duccorpora/ducc2006/
  > DUC2007: https://www.duc.edu/duccorpora/ducc2007/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
