To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assessing the Performance of Automatic Speech Recognition Systems When Used by Native and Non-Native Speakers of Three Major Languages in Dictation Workflows" by JuliAn Zapata, Andreas S. A. Borg, and Mirsk Digital ApS, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the experiment with a sample of speakers of three major languages and with different linguistic profiles.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the experiment and the use of ASR systems in dictation workflows.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for the experiment. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **English**: A 200-word text used for all four tasks.
2. **French**: A 200-word text used for all four tasks.
3. **Spanish**: A 200-word text used for all four tasks.
4. **Indian-accented English**: A 200-word text used for the English task.
5. **Spanish-accented English**: A 200-word text used for the English task.
6. **Russian-accented French**: A 200-word text used for the French task.
7. **Spanish-accented French**: A 200-word text used for the French task.
8. **Iberian-accented Spanish**: A 200-word text used for the Spanish task.
9. **Latin-American Spanish**: A 200-word text used for the Spanish task.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for the experiment.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **English**, **French**, and **Spanish**, the citations are not explicitly mentioned, but the text is described as a 200-word text used for all four tasks.
- For **Indian-accented English**, **Spanish-accented English**, **Russian-accented French**, **Spanish-accented French**, **Iberian-accented Spanish**, and **Latin-American Spanish**, the citations are not explicitly mentioned, but the text is described as a 200-word text used for the respective tasks.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their descriptions from the paper.
