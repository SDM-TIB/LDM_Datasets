To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rakutenas Participation in WAT 2022:Parallel Dataset Filtering by Leveraging Vocabulary Heterogeneity" by Alberto Poncelas, Johanes Effendi, Ohnmar Htun, Sunil Kumar Yadav, Dongzhe Wang, Saurabh Jain, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the Parallel Corpus Filtering Task and the use of JParaCrawl v3.0.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the task of domain-specific data selection for scientific domain parallel corpus.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **JParaCrawl v3.0**: This dataset is used for the Parallel Corpus Filtering Task.
2. **ASPEC**: This dataset is used for scientific domain parallel corpus.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **JParaCrawl v3.0**, the citation is:
  > Makoto Morishita, Jun Suzuki, and Masaaki Nagata. 2020. JParaCrawl: A large scale web-based English-In Proceedings of TheJapanese parallel corpus.12th Language Resources and Evaluation Confer-ence, pages 3603a3609, Marseille, France.

- For **ASPEC**, the citation is:
  > Toshiaki Nakazawa, Hideya Mino, Isao Goto, RajDabre, Shohei Higashiyama, Shantipriya Parida,Anoop Kunchukuttan, Makoto Morishita, OndErejBojar, Chenhui Chu, Akiko Eriguchi, Kaori Abe,Yusuke Oda, and Sadao Kurohashi. 2022. Overviewof the 9th workshop on Asian translation. In Pro-ceedings of the 9th Workshop on Asian Translation(WAT2022), Gyeongju, Republic of Korea. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
