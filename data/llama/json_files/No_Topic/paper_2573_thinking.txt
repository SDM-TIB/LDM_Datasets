To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Language Technology for Closely Related Languages, Varieties and Dialects, pages 11a16,Hissar, Bulgaria, September 10, 2015. c2015 Association for Computational Linguistics" by Marc Franco-Salvador, Paolo Rosso, and Francisco Rangel, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the DSL shared task and the HispaBlogs dataset.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the DSL shared task and the use of various datasets for language identification.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **HispaBlogs**: A new collection of Spanish blogs from five different countries: Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Spain.
2. **DSL Corpus Collection (DSLCC)**: A dataset containing sentences in Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Czech, Slovak, Argentinian Spanish, Peninsular Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, Malay, Indonesian, and a group containing texts written in a set of other languages.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **HispaBlogs**, the citation is:
  > https://github.com/autoritas/RD-Lab/tree/master/data/HispaBlogs

- For **DSL Corpus Collection (DSLCC)**, the citation is:
  > Liling Tan, Marcos Zampieri, Nikola LjubeEsic, and JA org Tiedemann. 2014. Merging comparable datasources for the discrimination of similar languages: The dsl corpus collection. In Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Building and Using Comparable Cor-pora, pages 11a15, Reykjavik, Iceland.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
