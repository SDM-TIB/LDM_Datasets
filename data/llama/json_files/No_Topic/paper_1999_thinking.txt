To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stability analysis of Strange Attractors using Attractor Networks" by Anonymous Author(s), I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of attractor networks for the identiication of different regions and the parameters resulting in a particular region, in well-deined strange attractors. The introduction discusses the stability analysis of strange attractors and the use of Lyapunov stability tests.

In the **methods section**, the authors mention the use of attractor networks, which store and utilize information regarding the neuronal iring patterns observed during the training phase. They also mention the Lorenz and Rossler attractors, which are used for the experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the experimental results, including the phase spaces for each attractor with variations in the parameters.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the Lorenz attractor, the citation is:
  > Warwick Tucker. *The Lorenz attractor exists*. Comptes Rendus de la AcadAmie des Sciences-Series I-Mathematics, 328.12 (1999): 1197-1202.

- For the Rossler attractor, the citation is:
  > Christophe Letellier and Otto E. Rossler. *Rossler attractor*. Scholarpedia, 1.10 (2006): 1721.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
