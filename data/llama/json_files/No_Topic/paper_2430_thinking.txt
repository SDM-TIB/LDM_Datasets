To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finite State Intensional Semantics" by Mats Rooth, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **introduction, section 2, section 3, section 4, section 5, section 6, and section 7** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The introduction mentions the use of regular Kripke frames and finite state acceptors and transducers.

In the **section 2**, the authors discuss the definition of Hintikka semantics for intensional complements in the finite state framework.

In the **section 3**, the authors look at sub-clausal compositional semantics, using an encoding of discourse referents in strings.

In the **section 4**, the authors present the syntax-semantics interface, based on a categorial grammar.

In the **section 5**, the authors extend the semantics to question complements, using partition semantics for questions.

In the **section 6**, the authors describe the implementation.

In the **section 7**, the authors comment on applications and related work.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **W**, the citation is:
  > C := t | b
- For **V**, the citation is:
  > V := a | e
- For **S**, the citation is:
  > S := A1 := < | >A2 := < | > |W := [[A2SC][A2SV ][A2SC]A2] [ A1 ] [ A1 A1 ]
- For **R**, the citation is:
  > R in the running example is defined by making substitutions for letters that are marked by a minussign, i.e. letters in positions that the robot has not seen.
- For **W1**, the citation is:
  > W1 := [[A2SC][A2SV ][A2SC]A2] [ A1 ] [ A1 A1 ]
- For **W2**, the citation is:
  > W2 := [[A2SC][A2SV ][A2SC]A2] [ A1 ] [ A1 A1 ]
