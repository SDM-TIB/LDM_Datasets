To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Self-supervised Joint Training Framework for Document Reranking" by Xiaozhi Zhu, Tianyong Hao, Sijie Cheng, Fu Lee Wang, and Hai Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the MS MARCO passage ranking and TREC Robust datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the document ranking task and mention the use of pre-trained language models such as BERT.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **MS MARCO Passage Ranking**: This dataset is used for passage ranking tasks.
2. **TREC Robust04**: This dataset is used for passage ranking tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MS MARCO Passage Ranking**, the citation is:
  > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A human-generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.05871, 2016.

- For **TREC Robust04**, the citation is:
  > Ellen M Voorhees. Overview of the trec 2004 robust retrieval track. In Proceedings of the 13th Text Retrieval Conference, pages 1â€“11, 2004.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
