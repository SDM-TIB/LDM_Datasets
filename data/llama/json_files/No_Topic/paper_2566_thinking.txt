To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ICARUS for intonation" by Markus GA artner et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the ICARUS tool for intonation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of manual annotation of speech data and the importance of automatic annotations. They hint at the use of various annotation layers, including prosody, syntax, and coreference.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **DIRNDL corpus**: This corpus is used for coreference resolution and bridging resolution tasks.
2. **ToBI system for American English**: This system is used for manual annotation of pitch accents and prosodic phrase boundaries.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the ICARUS tool.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DIRNDL corpus**, the citation is:
  > Anders BjA orkelund, Kerstin Eckart, Arndt Riester, Nadja Schaufier, and Katrin Schweitzer. 2014. The Extended DIRNDL Corpus as a Resource for Coreference and Bridging Resolution. In LREC.

- For **ToBI system for American English**, the citation is:
  > Mary Beckman and Julia Hirschberg. 1999. The ToBI Annotation Conventions. http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/Etobi/ame_tobi/annotation_conventions.html.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
