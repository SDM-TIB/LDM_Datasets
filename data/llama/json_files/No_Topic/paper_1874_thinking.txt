To extract datasets from the Proceedings of the SIGDIAL 2015 Conference, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the MultiLing contest of SIGDIAL 2015, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the problem of extractive text summarization for a collection of documents, which implies the use of datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MultiLing 2015 dataset**: This dataset is used for multi-document summarization tasks in three languages: English, Hebrew, and Arabic.
2. **MultiLing 2015 single-document summarization (MSS) dataset**: This dataset is used for single-document summarization tasks in three languages: English, Hebrew, and Arabic.
3. **MultiLing 2015 multi-document summarization (MMS) dataset**: This dataset is used for multi-document summarization tasks in three languages: English, Hebrew, and Arabic.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MultiLing 2015 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Davis, S. T., Conroy, J. M., & Schlesinger, J. D. (2012). OCCAMS: An Optimal Combinatorial Covering Algorithm for Multi-document Summarization. Proceedings of the IEEE 12th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, 454-463.

- For **MultiLing 2015 MSS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Davis, S. T., Conroy, J. M., & Schlesinger, J. D. (2012). OCCAMS: An Optimal Combinatorial Covering Algorithm for Multi-document Summarization. Proceedings of the IEEE 12th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, 454-463.

- For **MultiLing 2015 MMS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Davis, S. T., Conroy, J. M., & Schlesinger, J. D. (2012). OCCAMS: An Optimal Combinatorial Covering Algorithm for Multi-document Summarization. Proceedings of the IEEE 12th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, 454-463.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
