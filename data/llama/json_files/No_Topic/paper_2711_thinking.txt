To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Stylistic and Content-based Classifier for Hyperpartisan News Detection" by A. Urgen Knauth, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the SemEval-2019 shared task 4 and the use of several datasets for training and validation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of hyperpartisan news detection and the lack of research in this area.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and validation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SemEval-2019 Task 4 dataset**: This dataset is used for training and validation of the hyperpartisan news detection model.
2. **American news articles dataset**: This dataset is used for training and validation of the hyperpartisan news detection model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SemEval-2019 Task 4 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Johannes Kiesel, Maria Mestre, Rishabh Shukla, Emanuel Vincent, Payam Adineh, David Corney, Benno Stein, and Martin Potthast. *Semeval-2019 task 4: Hyperpartisan news detection*. In Proceedings of The 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2019), pages 976-980, 2019. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/S19-1021

- For **American news articles dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
