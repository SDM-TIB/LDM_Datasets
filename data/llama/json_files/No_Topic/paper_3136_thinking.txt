To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ICARUS: A Versatile Graphical Search Tool for Dependency Treebanks" by Markus GA artner, Gregor Thiele, Wolfgang Seeker, Anders Björkelund, Jonas Kuhn, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the tool ICARUS and its application to dependency treebanks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of linguistically annotated corpora and the need for suitable and intuitive tools for exploration. They also mention related work on tools for querying linguistic treebanks.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following treebanks:

1. **CoNLL 2008 Shared Task data set**: This dataset is used for dependency parsing tasks.
2. **Prague Dependency Treebank for Czech**: This dataset is used for dependency parsing tasks.
3. **SynTagRus for Russian**: This dataset is used for dependency parsing tasks.
4. **Fangorn**: This dataset is used for querying constituent treebanks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their tool ICARUS, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CoNLL 2008 Shared Task data set**, the citation is:
  > Mihai Surdeanu, Richard Johansson, Adam Meyers, Lluís Màrquez, and Joakim Nivre. *The CoNLL 2008 Shared Task on Joint Parsing of Syntactic and Semantic Dependencies*. In Proceedings of CoNLL 2008, pages 159–177, 2008.

- For **Prague Dependency Treebank for Czech**, the citation is:
  > Jan Hajič, Alena Bohnová, Eva Hajičová, and Barbora Vidová-Hladká. *The Prague Dependency Treebank: A Three-Level Annotation Scenario*. In Treebanks: Building and Using Parsed Corpora, pages 103–127, 2000.

- For **SynTagRus for Russian**, the citation is:
  > Igor Boguslavsky, Svetlana Grigorieva, Nikolai Grigoriev, Leonid Kreidlin, and Nadezhda Frid. *Dependency Treebank for Russian: Concept, Tools, and Resources*. In Proceedings of the 2000 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), pages 1–19, 2000.

- For **Fangorn**, the citation is:
  > Sumukh Ghodke and Steven Bird. *Fangorn: A System for Querying very large Treebanks*. In Proceedings of COLING 2012: Demonstration Papers, pages 175–182, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
