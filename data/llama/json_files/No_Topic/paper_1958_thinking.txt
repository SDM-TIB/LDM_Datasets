    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NEURAL GRAPH EVOLUTION: TOWARDS EFFICIENT AUTOMATIC ROBOT DESIGN" by Tingwu Wang, Yuhao Zhou, Sanja Fidler, and Jimmy Ba, I will follow a systematic approach.

    First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the robotic locomotion control, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

    In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous approaches and the goal of the proposed method, Neural Graph Evolution (NGE). They hint at the evaluation of the proposed method on various robotic locomotion control tasks, but I need to look for specific names.

    Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

    1. **MuJoCo**: A physics engine for model-based control.
    2. **Fish Env**: A 2D environment for fish locomotion control.
    3. **Walker Env**: A 2D environment for walker locomotion control.
    4. **Cheetah Env**: A 2D environment for cheetah locomotion control.

    In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of the proposed method, NGE.

    Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

    - For **MuJoCo**, the citation is:
      > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). Stochastic optimization for robot locomotion. In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012.

    - For **Fish Env**, **Walker Env**, and **Cheetah Env**, the citations are not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

    After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
