To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural sentence generation from formal semantics" by Kana Manome et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of logical formulas in sentence generation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of semantic parsing systems and mention the use of datasets annotated with logical formulas.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the use of the SNLI corpus and the creation of a custom dataset annotated with logical formulas.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the SNLI corpus, the citation is:
  > Bowman et al. (2015) - SNLI: A Large-Scale Natural Language Inference Corpus
- For the custom dataset, the citation is:
  > Not explicitly mentioned, but the authors mention the use of ccg2lambda and C&C parser for parsing and inference.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
