To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Oriented Object Proposals" by Shengfeng He and Rynson W.H. Lau, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset and the Freestyle Motocross dataset.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset and the Freestyle Motocross dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset and the Freestyle Motocross dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PASCAL VOC 2007**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Eslami, S., Gool, L. van, Williams, C., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2010). The Pascal visual object classes challenge. IJCV, 88(2), 303–338.

- For **Freestyle Motocross**, the citation is:
  > Villamizar, M., Moreno-Noguer, F., Andrade-Cetto, J., & Sanfeliu, A. (2010). Efficient rotation invariant object detection using boosted random ferns. In Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 1038–1045.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
