To extract datasets from the research paper titled "YZU-NLP Team at SemEval-2016 Task 4: Ordinal Sentiment Classification Using a Recurrent Convolutional Network" by Yunchao He et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the Sentiment analysis of tweets has attracted considerable attention recently for potential use in commercial and public sector applications, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the typical sentiment analysis classifies the sentiment of sentences into several discrete classes (e.g., positive and negative), and Task 4 subtask C of SemEval-2016 seeks to classify the sentiment of tweets into an ordinal five-point scale.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SemEval-2016 Task 4 subtask C dataset**: This dataset is used for ordinal sentiment classification of tweets.
2. **Vader corpus**: This dataset is used to further improve word embeddings to capture sentiment information.
3. **Twitter public timeline**: This dataset is used to annotate sentiment ratings in a range of [-4, 4].

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SemEval-2016 Task 4 subtask C dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nakov et al. (2015) Evaluation Measures for the SemEval-2016 Task 4 aSentiment Analysis in Twittera (Draft: Version 1.1).

- For **Vader corpus**, the citation is:
  > Hutto et al. (2014) Vader: A par-simonious rule-based model for sentiment analysis of social media text.

- For **Twitter public timeline**, the citation is:
  > Hutto et al. (2014) Vader: A par-simonious rule-based model for sentiment analysis of social media text.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
