To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Clause Attention for Long Sentence Processing" by [Unknown], I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of datasets for training and evaluation of the clause attention model.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of attention mechanisms for long sentence processing and mention the use of datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CoNLL-2003**: A dataset for named entity recognition.
2. **NiuTrans English-Chinese**: A dataset for machine translation.
3. **WMT16 English-German**: A dataset for machine translation.
4. **WMT15 English-Vietnamese**: A dataset for machine translation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and evaluation of the clause attention model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CoNLL-2003**, the citation is:
  > [32]

- For **NiuTrans English-Chinese**, the citation is:
  > [32]

- For **WMT16 English-German**, the citation is:
  > [32]

- For **WMT15 English-Vietnamese**, the citation is:
  > [32]

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
