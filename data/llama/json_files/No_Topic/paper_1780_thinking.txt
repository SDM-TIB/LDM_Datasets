To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Rare Category Classifiers on a Tight Labeling Budget" by Ravi Teja Mullapudi, Fait Poms, William R. Mark, and Deva Ramanan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of models for rare categories, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of building models for rare categories and the importance of using semi-supervised and active learning approaches. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **iNaturalist**: A fine-grained species recognition dataset.
2. **Places**: A scene classification dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **iNaturalist**, the citation is:
  > Grant Van Horn, Oisin Mac Aodha, Yang Song, Yin Cui, Chen Sun, Alex Shepard, Hartwig Adam, Pietro Perona, and Serge Belongie. *The inaturalist species classification and detection dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 8769a8778, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2018.00062

- For **Places**, the citation is:
  > Bolei Zhou, Agata Lapedriza, Aditya Khosla, Aude Oliva, and Antonio Torralba. *Places: A 10 million image database for scene recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2017. https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2459

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
