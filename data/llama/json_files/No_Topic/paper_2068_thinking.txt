To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expressing the Opposite: Acoustic Cues of Thai Verbal Irony" by Nimit Kumwapee and Sujinat Jitwiriyanont, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the acoustic cues of sarcasm in Thai, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the linguistic device of verbal irony and its relation to sarcasm, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for the study. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Baseline Reading Set**: A set of 30 baseline sentences without any context provided.
2. **Biased Reading Set**: A set of 30 baseline sentences preceded by their biasing context.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for the study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Baseline Reading Set**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.
- For **Biased Reading Set**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
