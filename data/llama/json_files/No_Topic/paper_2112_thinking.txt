To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3PointTM: Faster Measurement of High-Dimensional Transmission Matrices" by Yujun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The introduction mentions the measurement of transmission matrices and the challenges of measuring them.

In the **methods section**, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Holographic interferometry dataset**: This dataset is used for phase-shifting holography.
2. **Phase retrieval dataset**: This dataset is used for phase retrieval methods.
3. **Four-step holography dataset**: This dataset is used for four-step holography methods.
4. **Genetic algorithm dataset**: This dataset is used for genetic algorithm optimization.
5. **PrVAMP dataset**: This dataset is used for phase retrieval via VAMP.
6. **Multi-slice light propagation dataset**: This dataset is used for multi-slice light propagation models.
7. **Time-of-light imaging dataset**: This dataset is used for time-of-light imaging systems.
8. **Multi-slice light-propagation models dataset**: This dataset is used for modeling the transmission matrix as a composition of linear transformations.
9. **Random scattering media dataset**: This dataset is used for imaging through random scattering media.
10. **Tissue phantom dataset**: This dataset is used for imaging through tissue phantoms.
11. **Scattering media dataset**: This dataset is used for imaging through scattering media.
12. **Biological tissue dataset**: This dataset is used for imaging through biological tissue.
13. **Optical system dataset**: This dataset is used for modeling the optical system.
14. **Sensor dataset**: This dataset is used for measuring the sensor.
15. **Laser dataset**: This dataset is used for modeling the laser.
16. **Phase-only SLM dataset**: This dataset is used for phase-only SLM.
17. **Holographic diiuser dataset**: This dataset is used for holographic diiuser.
18. **Speckle intensity dataset**: This dataset is used for speckle intensity measurements.
19. **Image reconstruction dataset**: This dataset is used for image reconstruction.
20. **Focusing enhancement dataset**: This dataset is used for focusing enhancement.
