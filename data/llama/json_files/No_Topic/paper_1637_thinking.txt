To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Construction et maintenance d'une ressource lexicale basée sur la usage" by Laurie Planes, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the construction and maintenance of a lexical resource based on usage, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of lexical resources and the need for a robust and adaptable system. They hint at the use of existing lexical resources and the creation of new ones.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Lexique existant**: The authors import an existing lexical resource for French.
2. **FAQs**: The authors use FAQs from various projects to enrich the lexical resource.
3. **Corpus de questions utilisateurs**: The authors analyze the questions asked by users to improve the lexical resource.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for the construction and maintenance of the lexical resource.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Lexique existant**, the citation is:
  > Importation d'un lexique existant pour le franAais

- For **FAQs**, the citation is:
  > Utilisation de FAQs de projets diffArents pour enrichir le lexique

- For **Corpus de questions utilisateurs**, the citation is:
  > Analyse de questions utilisateurs pour améliorer le lexique

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
