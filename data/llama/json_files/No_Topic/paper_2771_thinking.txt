To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GBD-NER at PARSEME Shared Task 2018: Multiword Expression Detection Using Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory Networks and Graph-Based Decoding" by Tiberiu Boros, Ruxandra Burtica, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the PARSEME Shared Task and the use of standard MWE corpora.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the issue of multiword expression (MWE) detection and the use of standard MWE corpora supplied in the PARSEME Shared Task.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the PARSEME Shared Task corpora.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the PARSEME Shared Task corpora were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the PARSEME Shared Task, the citation is:
  > Carlos Ramisch, Silvio Ricardo Cordeiro, Agata Savary, Veronika Vincze, Verginica Barbu Mititelu, Archna Bhatia, Maja Buljan, Marie Candito, Polona Gantar, Voula Giouli, Tunga Gungor, Abdelati Hawwari, Uxoa Ienurrieta, Jolanta Kovalevskaitė, Simon Krek, Timm Lichte, Chaya Liebeskind, Johanna Monti, Carla Parra Escartán, Behrang Qasemi-Zadeh, Renata Ramisch, Nathan Schneider, Ivelina Stoyanova, Ashwini Vaidya, and Abigail Walsh. *Edition 1.1 of the PARSEME shared task on automatic identification of verbal multiword expressions*. In Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Linguistic Annotation, Multiword Expressions and Constructions (LAW-MWE-CxG-2018), Santa Fe, USA, August. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
