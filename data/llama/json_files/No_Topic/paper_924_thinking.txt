To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Scene Geometry for Visual Localization in Challenging Conditions" by Nathan Piasco, DAsirA SidibA, ValArie Gouet-Brunet, and Cedric Demonceaux, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the Oxford Robotcar public dataset, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of the Oxford Robotcar public dataset for image-based localization tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the Oxford Robotcar public dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the Oxford Robotcar public dataset was used for evaluation of their method.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Oxford Robotcar public dataset:

- For the Oxford Robotcar public dataset, the citation is:
  > W. Maddern, G. Pascoe, C. Linegar, and P. Newman. *1 year, 1000 km: The Oxford RobotCar dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR), 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
