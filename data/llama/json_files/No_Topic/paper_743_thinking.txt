To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enriched Feature Guided Reinement Network for Object Detection" by Jing Nie, Rao Muhammad Anwer, Hisham Cholakkal, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, and Yanwei Pang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of object detection models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing object detection methods and the importance of multi-scale contextual features. They hint at the evaluation of their proposed method on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **PASCAL VOC 2007**: This dataset is used for object detection tasks.
2. **MS COCO**: This dataset is used for object detection tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their model, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PASCAL VOC 2007**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The pascal visual object classes (voc) challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303â€“338, 2010.

- For **MS COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollA ar, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
