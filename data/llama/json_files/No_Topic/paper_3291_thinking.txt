To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tag Taxonomy Aware Dictionary Learning for Region Tagging" by Jingjing Zheng and Zhuolin Jiang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the proposed approach for region tagging using a two-layer tag taxonomy, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of region tagging and the limitations of existing approaches. They hint at the evaluation of their proposed method on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **MSRC-v1**: A dataset containing 240 images with 562 regions associated with 13 tags.
2. **MSRC-v2**: A dataset containing 591 images with 1482 regions associated with 23 tags.
3. **SAIAPR TC-12**: A dataset containing 99,535 regions segmented from 20,000 images with 276 tags.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their proposed method.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MSRC-v1**, the citation is:
  > J. Shotton, J. M. Winn, C. Rother, and A. Criminisi. Tex-tonboost for image understanding: Multi-class object recog-nition and segmentation by jointly modeling texture, lay-out, and context. International Journal of Computer Vision,2009. 5

- For **MSRC-v2**, the citation is:
  > J. Shotton, J. M. Winn, C. Rother, and A. Criminisi. Tex-tonboost for image understanding: Multi-class object recog-nition and segmentation by jointly modeling texture, lay-out, and context. International Journal of Computer Vision,2009. 5

- For **SAIAPR TC-12**, the citation is:
  > H. J. Escalante, C. A. HernA andez, J. A. GonzA alez, A. LA opez-LA opez, M. M. y GA omez, E. F. Morales, L. E. Sucar, L. V.Pineda, and M. Grubinger. The segmented and annotatediapr tc-12 benchmark. Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 2010.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
