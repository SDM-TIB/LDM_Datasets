To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multilingual Document Structure Extraction using Transfer Learning" by Frederic Haase, Ivan Taxy.io, and Steffen Kirchhoff, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the FinTOC-2020 shared task and the use of a benchmark dataset.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of automatic structure analysis of documents and mention the FinTOC-2020 shared task.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for the FinTOC-2020 shared task. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **FinTOC-2020 shared task dataset**: This dataset consists of 52 English and 47 French financial PDF documents.
2. **Juge et al. (2019) dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as a previous work on financial document structure extraction.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the FinTOC-2020 shared task dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **FinTOC-2020 shared task dataset**, the citation is:
  > Najah-Imane Bentabet, RA emi Juge, Ismail El Maarouf, Virginie Mouilleron, Dialekti Valsamou-Stanislawski, and Mahmoud El-Haj. 2020. The Financial Document Structure Extraction Shared task (FinToc 2020). In The 1st Joint Workshop on Financial Narrative Processing and MultiLing Financial Summarisation (FNP-FNS 2020, Barcelona, Spain.

- For **Juge et al. (2019) dataset**, the citation is:
  > Remi Juge, Imane Bentabet, and Sira Ferradans. 2019. The FinTOC-2019 shared task: Financial document structure extraction. In Proceedings of the Second Financial Narrative Processing Workshop (FNP 2019), pages 51a57, Turku, Finland, September.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
