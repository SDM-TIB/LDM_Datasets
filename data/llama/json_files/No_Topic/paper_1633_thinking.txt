To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Superadditivity and Convex Optimization for Globally Optimal Cell Segmentation Using Deformable Shape Models" by Leonid Kostrykin and Karl Rohr, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed approach using six image datasets of five different cell types.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of cell nuclei segmentation and the limitations of previous methods.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention six named datasets:

1. **NIH3T3 dataset**: A dataset of 49 Hoechst-stained images with a size of 13441024 pixels.
2. **U2OS dataset**: A dataset of 48 images of U2OS cells that were stained with Hoechst 33342.
3. **GOWT1 dataset 1**: A dataset of 31 images (with 150 cell nuclei) of GFP-transfected mouse embryonic stem cells.
4. **GOWT1 dataset 2**: A dataset of 20 images (128 cell nuclei) of GFP-transfected mouse embryonic stem cells.
5. **Fibroblast dataset**: A dataset of 175 3-D stacks of 35 x 50 DAPI-stained images of human Fibroblast cells.
6. **HeLa dataset**: A dataset of 25 DAPI-stained HeLa images.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **NIH3T3 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kalinin et al. (2018) 3D cell nuclear morphology: Microscopy imaging dataset and voxel-based morphometry classiication results, in Proceedings of the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pp. 2272–2280.

- For **U2OS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Coelho et al. (2009) Nuclear segmentation in microscope cell images: A hand-segmented dataset and comparison of algorithms, in Proceedings of the International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging, pp. 518–521.

- For **GOWT1 dataset 1**, the citation is:
  > IEEE ISBI CellTracking Challenge training data.

- For **GOWT1 dataset 2**, the citation is:
  > IEEE ISBI CellTracking Challenge training data.

- For **Fibroblast dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kalinin et al. (2018) 3D cell nuclear morphology: Microscopy imaging dataset and voxel-based morphometry classiication results, in Proceedings of the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pp. 2272–2280.

- For **HeLa dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ronja Rappold (2021) HeLa dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
