To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HIBOU: an eBook to improve Text Comprehension and Reading Fluency for Beginning Readers of French" by Ludivine Javourey-Drevet, StAphane Dufau, Johannes C. Ziegler, and NAoria Gala, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the ALECTOR corpus and the development of the HIBOU eBook.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of reading comprehension and fluency for beginning readers of French.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the ALECTOR corpus.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the ALECTOR corpus was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ALECTOR corpus:

- For ALECTOR, the citation is:
  > Gala, N., Tack, A., Javourey-Drevet, L., FranAois, T., & Ziegler, J. C. *Alector: A parallel corpus of simplified French texts with alignments of misreadings by poor and dyslexic readers*. In Language Resources and Evaluation for Language Technologies (LREC). European Language Resources Association, Marseille, France, 1353-1361.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
