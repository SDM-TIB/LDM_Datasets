To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural Language Generation from Pictographs" by Leen Sevens, Vincent Vandeghinste, Ineke Schuurman, and Frank Van Eynde, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the development of a Pictograph-to-Text translation system for people with Intellectual or Developmental Disabilities (IDD).

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for digital communication interfaces that enable written contact for people with IDD.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two pictograph sets:

1. **Sclera**: A pictograph set with mainly black-and-white pictographs, often representing complex concepts.
2. **Beta**: A pictograph set characterized by its overall consistency, with most pictographs representing simple concepts.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Sclera**, the citation is:
  > Vaillant (1998) offers a limited vocabulary of pictographs, each one corresponding to a single word.

- For **Beta**, the citation is:
  > The Beta set5 is characterized by its overall consistency. Beta hardly contains any complex pictographs.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
