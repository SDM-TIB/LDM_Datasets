To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lingua Custodiaas participation at the WMT 2021 Machine Translationusing Terminologies shared task" by Melissa Ailem, Jinghsu Liu and Raheel Qader, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the participation in the WMT21 shared task on machine translation using terminologies, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of neural machine translation models in handling terminology constraints. They hint at the use of three language pairs: English-French, Russian, and Chinese.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and testing. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **News Crawl 2020**: A dataset used for training and testing the model.
2. **NCv16**: A dataset used for training and testing the model.
3. **Europarl v10**: A dataset used for training and testing the model.
4. **EMEA, Medline Titles, Medline abstracts**: A dataset used for training and testing the model.
5. **Wikititles**: A dataset used for training and testing the model.
6. **ParaCrawl**: A dataset used for training and testing the model.
7. **YandexMedline**: A dataset used for training and testing the model.
8. **Common Crawl**: A dataset used for training and testing the model.
9. **UN**: A dataset used for training and testing the model.
10. **Wikimatrix**: A dataset used for training and testing the model.
11. **Biomedical data**: A dataset used for training and testing the model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and testing the model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **News Crawl 2020**, the citation is:
  > News Crawl 2020
- For **NCv16**, the citation is:
  > NCv16
- For **Europarl v10**, the citation is:
  > Europarl v10
- For **EMEA, Medline Titles, Medline abstracts**, the citation is:
  > EMEA, Medline Titles, Medline abstracts
- For **Wikititles**, the citation is:
  > Wikititles
- For **ParaCrawl**, the citation is:
  > ParaCrawl
- For **YandexMedline**, the citation is:
  > YandexMedline
- For **Common Crawl**, the citation is:
  > Common Crawl
- For **UN**, the citation is:
  > UN
- For **Wikimatrix**, the citation is:
  > Wikimatrix
- For **Biomedical data**, the citation is:
  > Biomedical data

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
