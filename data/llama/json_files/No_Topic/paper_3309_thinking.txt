To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent Trees for Coreference Resolution" by Eraldo Rezende Fernandes, CA Acero Nogueira dos Santos, and Ruy Luiz Milidi A u, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task data sets, which comprise three languages: Arabic, Chinese, and English.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task and its multilingual scope.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task data sets.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task data sets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task data sets, the citation is:
  > Sameer Pradhan, Alessandro Moschitti, Nianwen Xue, Olga Uryupina, and Yuchen Zhang. *CoNLL-2012 Shared Task: Modeling multilingual unrestricted coreference in OntoNotes*. In Joint Conference on EMNLP and CoNLLa Shared Task, CoNLLa12, pages 1-40, Jeju Island.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
