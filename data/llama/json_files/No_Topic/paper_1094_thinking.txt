To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications" by Marwa Ragheb and Markus Dickinson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the annotation scheme for learner language, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of learner corpora and the lack of annotated data and standards for POS tagging and parsing of learner language.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Learner corpus of written essays**: A dataset of written essays from students entering Indiana University.
2. **SUSANNE corpus**: A dataset of English texts used for POS tagging.
3. **TnT corpus**: A dataset of English texts used for POS tagging.
4. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: A dataset used for gene recognition tasks.
5. **JNLPBA corpus**: A dataset annotating proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
6. **CHEMDNER corpus**: A dataset annotating drugs and chemicals.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their annotation scheme, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Learner corpus of written essays**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.
- For **SUSANNE corpus**, the citation is:
