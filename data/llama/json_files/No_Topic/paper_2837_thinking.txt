To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dense Monocular Depth Estimation in Complex Dynamic Scenes" by RenA e Ranftl, Vibhav Vineet, Qifeng Chen, and Vladlen Koltun, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the approach on complex dynamic scenes, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of prior methods for monocular depth estimation in dynamic scenes and the need for a dense depth estimation approach that can handle complex scenes.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Sintel dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the approach.
2. **KITTI dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the approach.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Sintel dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Scharstein and S. Hirschmuller. High-quality large baseline stereo matching using the semi-global matching algorithm. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 33(12):2241–2251, 2011.

- For **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, C. Stiller, and R. Urtasun. Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset. International Journal of Robotics Research, 32(11):1733–1755, 2013.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
