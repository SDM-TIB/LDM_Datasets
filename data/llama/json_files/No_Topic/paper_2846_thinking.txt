To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single Image Camera Calibration with Lenticular Arrays for Augmented Reality" by Ian Schillebeeckx and Robert Pless, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of a lenticular array for camera calibration, which suggests that a dataset is likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional camera calibration methods and the potential of lenticular arrays for camera calibration. They hint at the evaluation of their method on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention a lenticular array calibration object.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the lenticular array calibration object was used for evaluation of their method.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the lenticular array calibration object:

- For the lenticular array calibration object, the citation is:
  > I. Schillebeeckx, J. Little, B. Kelly, and R. Pless. The geometry of colorful, lenticular iducial markers. In International Conference on 3D Vision, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
