To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Number agreement, dependency length, and word order in Finnish traditional dialects" by Kaius SinnemÃ¤ki and Akira Takaki, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of The Finnish Dialect Syntax Archive, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the variation in number agreement in Finnish traditional dialects and the use of corpus data.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention:

1. **The Finnish Dialect Syntax Archive**: This dataset contains recorded spoken data from more than 100 interviewees, totaling roughly one million lemmas.
2. **Universal Dependencies data**: This dataset is mentioned as a reference, but not explicitly used in the paper.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that The Finnish Dialect Syntax Archive was used for the analysis.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for The Finnish Dialect Syntax Archive:

> University of Turku, School of Languages and Translation Studies and Institute for the Languages of Finland. 1985. The Finnish Dialect Syntax Archive as Helsinki Korp Version.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
