To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Auto-Encoding Dictionary Definitions into Consistent Word Embeddings" by Tom Bosc and Pascal Vincent, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of monolingual dictionaries and the evaluation of word embeddings on various benchmarks.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing word embedding methods and the potential of using dictionary definitions to improve word embeddings.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **WordNet**: A lexical database containing graphs of linguistic relations, including synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy, and hypernymy.
2. **SimLex999**: A benchmark for evaluating word similarity.
3. **SimLex333**: A subset of SimLex999 focused on pairs of words that are very related but can be either similar or dissimilar.
4. **MEN**: A benchmark for evaluating word relatedness.
5. **RG**: A benchmark for evaluating word relatedness.
6. **WS353**: A benchmark for evaluating word relatedness.
7. **SCWS**: A benchmark for evaluating word relatedness.
8. **MTurk**: A benchmark for evaluating word relatedness.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WordNet**, the citation is:
  > Christian Fellbaum. 1998. WordNet. Wiley Online Library.

- For **SimLex999**, the citation is:
  > Felix Hill, Kyunghyun Cho, Anna Korhonen, and Yoshua Bengio. 2015. Learning to understand phrases by embedding the dictionary. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00548.

- For **SimLex333**, the citation is:
  > Felix Hill, Kyunghyun Cho, Anna Korhonen, and Yoshua Bengio. 2015. Learning to understand phrases by embedding the dictionary. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00548.

- For **MEN**, the citation is:
  > Anna Rogers, Aleksandr Drozd, and Bofang Li. 2017. The (Too Many) Problems of Analogical Reasoning with Word Vectors. In Proceedings of the 6th Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (* SEM 2017), pages 135–148.

- For **RG**, the citation is:
  > Herbert Rubenstein and John B Goodenough. 1965. Contextual correlates of synonymy. Communications of the ACM, 8(10), 627–633.

- For **WS353**, the citation is:
  > Lev Finkelstein, Evgeniy Gabrilovich, Yossi Matias, Eduard Rivlin, Zach Solan, Gadi Wolfman, and Eytan Ruppin. 2001. Placing search in context: The concept revisited. In Proceedings of the 10th international conference on World Wide Web, pages 406–414.

- For **SCWS**, the citation is:
  > Eric H. Huang, Richard Socher, Christopher D. Manning, and Andrew Y. Ng. 2012. Improving word representations via global context and multiple word prototypes. In Proceedings of the 50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Long Papers-Volume 1, pages 873–882.

- For **MTurk**, the citation is:
  > Kira Radinsky, Eugene Agichtein, Evgeniy Gabrilovich, and Shaul Markovitch. 2011. Word at a time: computing word relatedness using temporal semantic analysis. In Proceedings of the 20th international conference on World wide web, pages 337–346.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
