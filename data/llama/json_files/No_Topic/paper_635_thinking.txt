To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Flexible Spatio-Temporal Networks for Video Prediction" by Chaochao Lu, Michael Hirsch, and Bernhard SchÃ¶lkopf, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for video prediction, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous video prediction methods and the importance of designing a flexible spatio-temporal network for video prediction. They hint at the evaluation of their model on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three public datasets:

1. **UCF101**: A dataset of 13,320 videos with an average length of 6.2 seconds from 101 different action categories.
2. **Sports1m**: A dataset of 1 million YouTube clips, with a subset of 600 randomly selected videos used for training.
3. **PROST (Video Sequences)**: A dataset of video sequences extracted from the PROST dataset, used for training and comparison with the proposed model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their model, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > K. Soomro, A. R. Zamir, and M. Shah. UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

- For **Sports1m**, the citation is:
  > A. Karpathy, G. Toderici, S. Shetty, T. Leung, R. Sukthankar, and L. Fei-Fei. Large-scale video classification with convolutional neural networks. In CVPR, 2014.

- For **PROST (Video Sequences)**, the citation is:
  > J. Santner, C. Leistner, A. Saffari, T. Pock, and H. Bischof. Prost: Parallel robust online simple tracking. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2010 IEEE Conference on, pages 723a730. IEEE, 2010.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
