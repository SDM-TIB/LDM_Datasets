To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Preliminary Experiments on CrowdsourcedEvaluation of Feedback Granularity" by Nitin Madnani, Martin Chodorow, Aoife Cahill, Melissa Lopez, Yoko Futagi, and Yigal Attali, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of Amazon Mechanical Turk for crowdsourcing, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of the CLC-FCE corpus, which is a dataset for preposition errors.

In the **materials and methods section**, the authors mention the CLC-FCE corpus, which is used for the experiment.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the CLC-FCE corpus was used for the experiment.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CLC-FCE corpus:

- For the CLC-FCE corpus, the citation is:
  > Helen Yannakoudakis, Ted Briscoe, and Ben Medlock. *A New Dataset and Method for AutomaticallyGrading ESOL Texts*. In Proceedings of the ACL:HLT, pages 180a189, Portland, OR, USA.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
