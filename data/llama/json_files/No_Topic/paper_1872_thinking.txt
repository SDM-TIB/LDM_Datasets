To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Iniuence of Regional Pronunciation Variation on Childrenas Spellingand the Potential Beneits of Accent Adapted Spellcheckers" by Emma OaNeill, Joe Kenny, Anthony Ventresque, and Julie Carson-Berndsen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of misspelling data from schoolchildren across Ireland.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of misspelling data from schoolchildren across Ireland and the adaptation of an existing English phonetic-based spellchecker.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **IAE-corpus**: A corpus of 232 pairs of misspellings and real-word targets.
2. **Holbrook corpus**: A collection of misspellings extracted from the writings of British schoolchildren.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **IAE-corpus**, the citation is:
  > Marina Everri and Kirsty Park. 2018. Childrenas onlinebehaviours in Irish primary and secondary schools. Technical report, Zeeko, Nova UCD.

- For **Holbrook corpus**, the citation is:
  > David Holbrook. 1964. English for the rejected: Training literacy in the lower streams of the secondary school.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
