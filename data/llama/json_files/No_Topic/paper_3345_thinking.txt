To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-task learning for interpretable cause-of-death classification using key phrase prediction" by Serena Jeblee, Mireille Gomes, and Graeme Hirst, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the Million Death Study (MDS) dataset.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of the MDS dataset, which contains 12,045 records of adult deaths from India.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the MDS dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the MDS dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MDS dataset:

- For the MDS dataset, the citation is:
  > Westly, E. (2013). Global health: One million deaths. Nature, 504(7478), 22a23.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
