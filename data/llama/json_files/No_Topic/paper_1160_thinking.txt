To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control" by Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the robotic control domain, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing physics engines and the importance of simulation tools for robotic control. They hint at the evaluation of these engines on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MuJoCo dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the MuJoCo physics engine.
2. **Isolated model**: This dataset is used for smooth dynamics evaluation.
3. **Chain model**: This dataset is used for smooth dynamics evaluation.
4. **Hand model**: This dataset is used for smooth dynamics evaluation.
5. **Humanoid model**: This dataset is used for smooth dynamics evaluation.
6. **SD/FAST dataset**: This dataset is used for comparison with MuJoCo.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of the MuJoCo physics engine, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MuJoCo dataset**, the citation is:
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. University of Washington, 2016.

- For **Isolated model**, the citation is:
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. University of Washington, 2016.

- For **Chain model**, the citation is:
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. University of Washington, 2016.

- For **Hand model**, the citation is:
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. University of Washington, 2016.

- For **Humanoid model**, the citation is:
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. University of Washington, 2016.

- For **SD/FAST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. University of Washington, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
