To extract datasets from the research paper titled "More Eicient Topic Modelling Through a Noun Only Approach" by Fiona Martin and Mark Johnson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the comparison of three topic models on a news corpus, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenge of summarizing large collections of text documents and the importance of topic modeling. They hint at the use of a news corpus for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Tipster corpus**: A news corpus containing 90,257 articles.
2. **San Jose Mercury News (SJMN) articles**: A news corpus containing 35.8 million words.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Tipster corpus**, the citation is:
  > Harman, D. & Liberman, M. (1993). TIPSTER https://Complete LDC93T3A. DVD.catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93T3D.

- For **San Jose Mercury News (SJMN) articles**, the citation is:
  > Harman, D. & Liberman, M. (1993). TIPSTER https://Complete LDC93T3A. DVD.catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93T3D.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
