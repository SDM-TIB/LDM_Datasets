To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Query-Adaptive Late Fusion for Image Search and Person Re-identiication" by Liang Zheng, Shengjin Wang, Lu Tian, Fei He, Ziqiong Liu, and Qi Tian, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of three datasets for image search and person re-identiication tasks.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of feature fusion in image search and person re-identiication tasks. They mention that feature fusion has been proven effective in image search.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named datasets:

1. **Holidays dataset**: A dataset containing 1,491 personal holiday pictures.
2. **Ukbench dataset**: A dataset containing 10,200 images composed of 2,550 groups.
3. **VIPeR dataset**: A dataset used for person re-identiication tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their method.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Holidays dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. JA egou, M. Douze, and C. Schmid. Hamming embedding and weak geometric consistency for large scale image search. In ECCV, 2008.

- For **Ukbench dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Niester and H. Stewenius. Scalable recognition with a vocabulary tree. In CVPR, 2006.

- For **VIPeR dataset**, the citation is:
  > W.-S. Zheng, S. Gong, and T. Xiang. Person re-identiication In CVPR, by probabilistic relative distance comparison. 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
