To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WMDO: Fluency-based Word Moveras Distance for Machine Translation Evaluation" by Julian Chow, Pranava Madhyastha, and Lucia Specia, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of machine translation models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of current metrics for machine translation evaluation, which hints at the use of datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **WMT17 segment-level into-English datasets**: This dataset is used for evaluation of machine translation models.
2. **Word2vec embeddings**: This dataset is used for word embeddings.
3. **FastText embeddings**: This dataset is used for FastText embeddings.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the proposed WMDO metric.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WMT17 segment-level into-English datasets**, the citation is:
  > Ondrej Bojar, Yvette Graham, and Amir Kamran. 2017. Results of the wmt17 metrics shared task. Proceedings of the Second Conference on Machine Translation, page 489-494.

- For **Word2vec embeddings**, the citation is:
  > Mikolov et al. (2013) Word2vec: A Novel Semi-Supervised Learning Approach for Word Embeddings.

- For **FastText embeddings**, the citation is:
  > Mikolov et al. (2018) Advances in pre-training distributed word representations.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
