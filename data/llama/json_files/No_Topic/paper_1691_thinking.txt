To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Generative Models with the UpPropagation Algorithm" by JongHoon Oh and H Sebastian Seung, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the benchmarking of uppropagation against principal component analysis (PCA) on images of handwritten digits.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the algorithm uppropagation and its relation to Helmholtz's doctrine of unconscious inference.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **USPS dataset**: This dataset consists of example images of handwritten digits.
2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) datasets**: The authors compare uppropagation with PCA, but do not specify the exact datasets used for PCA.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the USPS dataset was used for evaluation of uppropagation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **USPS dataset**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
