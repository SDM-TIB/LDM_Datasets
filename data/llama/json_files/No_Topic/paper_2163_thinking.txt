To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stacked Ensembles of Information Extractors for Knowledge-Base Population" by Nazneen Fatema Rajani et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of stacking to ensemble multiple systems for the Knowledge Base Population English Slot Fill task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the KBP-ESF task and the use of stacking to ensemble multiple systems. They mention the KBP-ESF systems and the KBP Slot Filler Validation task.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Common Systems Dataset**: A dataset of one run for every team that participated in both the 2013 and 2014 competitions.
2. **All 2014 SFV Systems Dataset**: A dataset of all 2014 SFV systems, including all runs of all 17 teams that participated in 2014.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Common Systems Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.
- For **All 2014 SFV Systems Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
