To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A3-108 Machine Translation System for LoResMTShared Task @MT Summit 2021 Conference" by Saumitra Yadav, Manish Shrivastava, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the LoResMT Shared Task and the use of various tokenization schemes, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of data-driven methods for machine translation and mention the LoResMT shared task, which involves translating English to Marathi.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Marathi training, dev dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the machine translation system.
2. **English monolingual corpus**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the machine translation system.
3. **English training and dev data from both English aa Marathi, English aa Irish language pair**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the machine translation system.
4. **Marathi monolingual corpus**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the machine translation system.
5. **IndicNLP toolkit dataset**: This dataset is used for tokenization of Marathi text.
6. **Moses tokenizer dataset**: This dataset is used for tokenization of English text.
7. **CFILT toolkit dataset**: This dataset is used for preprocessing of English text.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and evaluation of the machine translation system.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Marathi training, dev dataset**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.
- For **English monolingual corpus**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.
- For **English training and dev data from both English aa Marathi, English aa Irish language pair**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.
- For **Marathi monolingual corpus**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.
- For **IndicNLP toolkit dataset**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.
- For **Moses tokenizer dataset**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.
- For **CFILT toolkit dataset**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
