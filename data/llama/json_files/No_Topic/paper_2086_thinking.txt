To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Masked Latent Semantic Modeling: an Efficient Pre-training Alternative to Masked Language Modeling" by Gabor Berend, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the masked language modeling task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of masked language modeling and the importance of semantic resources, which hints at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SEMCOR corpus**: This dataset is used for semantic sense induction.
2. **WordNet**: This dataset is used for semantic sense induction.
3. **ConceptNet**: This dataset is used for semantic sense induction.
4. **WikiBERT models**: This dataset is used for pre-training language models.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SEMCOR corpus**, the citation is:
  > Miller et al. (1994) used SEMCOR for sense induction.

- For **WordNet**, the citation is:
  > Fellbaum (1998) introduced WordNet.

- For **ConceptNet**, the citation is:
  > Speer et al. (2017) introduced ConceptNet.

- For **WikiBERT models**, the citation is:
  > Pyysalo et al. (2021) introduced WikiBERT models.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
