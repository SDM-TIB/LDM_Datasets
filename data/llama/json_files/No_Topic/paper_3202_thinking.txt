To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transition-Based Parsing for DeepDependency Structures" by Xun Zhang, Yantao Du, Weiwei Sun, and Xiaojun Wan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various corpora for dependency parsing, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional dependency parsing models and the potential of transition-based parsing for deep dependency structures. They mention the use of several corpora, including CCGBank, DeepBank, and EnjuBank.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CCGBank**: A corpus of CCG derivations and dependency structures extracted from the Penn treebank.
2. **DeepBank**: A dynamically annotated treebank of the Wall Street journal.
3. **EnjuBank**: A corpus for semantic dependency parsing.
4. **GRBank**: A corpus for grammatical relation analysis.
5. **PropBank**: A corpus of propositional semantics.
6. **Penn Treebank**: A classic corpus for natural language processing tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CCGBank**, the citation is:
  > Hockenmaier, Julia and Mark Steedman. 2007. CCGbank: A corpus of CCG derivations and dependency structures extracted from the Penn treebank. Computational Linguistics, 33(3):355a396.

- For **DeepBank**, the citation is:

- For **EnjuBank**, the citation is:

- For **GRBank**, the citation is:
  > Sun, Weiwei, Yantao Du, Xin Kou, Shuoyang Ding, and Xiaojun Wan. 2014. Grammatical relations in Chinese: GB-ground extraction and data-driven parsing. In Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1:Long Papers), pages 446a456, Baltimore.

- For **PropBank**, the citation is:
  > Palmer, Martha, Daniel Gildea, and Paul Kingsbury. 2005. The proposition bank: An annotated corpus of semantic roles. Computational Linguistics, 31(1):71a106.

- For **Penn Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Penn Treebank Project. (n.d.). Penn Treebank. Retrieved from <https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/penn-treebank/>

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
