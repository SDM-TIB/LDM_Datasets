To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Concept Wikiication for COVID-19" by Panagiotis Lymperopoulos, Haoling Qiu, Bonan Min, and Tufts University, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the development of an approach to curate a COVID-19 concept wikiication dataset by mining Wikipedia text and the associated intra-Wikipedia links.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the problem of concept wikiication for COVID-19 and the need for a large labeled dataset for training concept wikiiers.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **COVID-19 concept wikiication dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of concept wikiiers.
2. **Wikipedia text and intra-Wikipedia links**: This dataset is used to mine concepts related to COVID-19.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the COVID-19 concept wikiication dataset was successfully curated and used for training and evaluation of concept wikiiers.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **COVID-19 concept wikiication dataset**, the citation is:
  > Panagiotis Lymperopoulos, Haoling Qiu, Bonan Min, and Tufts University. *Concept Wikiication for COVID-19*. GitHub, 2020. https://github.com/panlybero/Covid19_wikification

- For **Wikipedia text and intra-Wikipedia links**, the citation is:
  > Not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
