To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on NLP for Similar Languages, Varieties and Dialects, pages 190a199,Valencia, Spain, April 3, 2017. c2017 Association for Computational Linguistics" by Chris van der Lee and Antal van den Bosch, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the exploration of lexical and syntactic features for language variety identification, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenge of distinguishing between similar languages and language varieties, and mention the Discriminating between Similar Languages (DSL) shared task.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the SUBTIEL corpus:

1. **SUBTIEL corpus**: This corpus contains over 500,000 subtitles in Dutch and English.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the SUBTIEL corpus was used for the evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SUBTIEL corpus:

> The SUBTIEL corpus contains over 500,000 sub-titles in Dutch and English. These subtitles were produced by a professional studio operating in several countries, among which The Netherlands and Belgium.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
