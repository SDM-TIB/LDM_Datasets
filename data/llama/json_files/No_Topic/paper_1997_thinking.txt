To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Open-domain question classification and completion in conversational information search" by Omid Mohammadi Kia, Mahmood Neshati, and Mahsa Soudi Alamdari, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the TREC CAsT 2019 track, which is one of the first attempts to build a framework in this area. This suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing neural networks and the importance of developing a rule-based method. They hint at the use of the TREC CAsT dataset for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the TREC CAsT dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the TREC CAsT dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the TREC CAsT dataset:

- For TREC CAsT, the citation is:
  > J. Dalton, C. Xiong, and J. Callan. *CAsT 2019: The Conversational Assistance Track Overview*. 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
