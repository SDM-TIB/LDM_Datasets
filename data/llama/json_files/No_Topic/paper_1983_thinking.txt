To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FII_CROSS at SemEval-2021 Task 2: Multilingual and Cross-lingual Word-in-Context Disambiguation" by Ciprian Bodnar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of datasets from SemEval 2021 Task 2.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of datasets from SemEval 2021 Task 2.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SemEval-2021 Task 2 dataset**: This dataset is used for multilingual and cross-lingual word-in-context disambiguation tasks.
2. **SemEval-2021 Task 2 dataset (training and testing sets)**: This dataset is used for training and testing the proposed system.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SemEval-2021 Task 2 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Martelli F., Kalach N., Tola G., Navigli R. (2021) SemEval-2021 Task 2: Multilingual and Cross-lingual Word-in-Context Disambiguation (MCL-WiC). In Proceedings of the 15th Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
