To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A multi-Teraiop Constituency Parser using GPUs" by John Canny and David Hall, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the Berkeley latent variable grammar and the Penn Treebank section 22.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of full CKY parsing and the use of GPUs for CKY chart evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the Penn Treebank.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the Penn Treebank was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Penn Treebank:

- For the Penn Treebank, the citation is:
  > Mitchell P. Marcus, Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. 1993. Building a large annotated corpus of english: The penn treebank. COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS, 19(2):313-330.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
