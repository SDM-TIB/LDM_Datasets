To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diversity Augmented Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of multiple datasets for image-to-image translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) and the importance of diversity augmentation for image-to-image translation tasks. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CatDog**: A dataset for two-domain image-to-image translation tasks.
2. **Yosemite Summer Winter**: A dataset for two-domain image-to-image translation tasks.
3. **Alps Seasonal Transfer**: A dataset for multi-domain image-to-image translation tasks.
4. **Image Weather Conditions**: A dataset for multi-domain image-to-image translation tasks.
5. **AFHQ**: A dataset for multi-domain image-to-image translation tasks.
6. **WikiArts**: A dataset for multi-domain image-to-image translation tasks.
7. **CatDog**: A dataset for two-domain image-to-image translation tasks.
8. **DogCat**: A dataset for two-domain image-to-image translation tasks.
9. **Summer Winter**: A dataset for two-domain image-to-image translation tasks.
10. **Yosemite**: A dataset for two-domain image-to-image translation tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CatDog**, the citation is:
  > Lee et al. (2018) [32]

- For **Yosemite Summer Winter**, the citation is:
  > Zhu et al. (2017a) [1]

- For **Alps Seasonal Transfer**, the citation is:
  > Anoosheh et al. (2018) [33]

- For **Image Weather Conditions**, the citation is:
  > Chu et al. (2017) [34]

- For **AFHQ**, the citation is:
  > Choi et al. (2020) [35]

- For **WikiArts**, the citation is:
  > Zhu et al. (2017a) [1]

- For **CatDog**, the citation is:
  > Lee et al. (2018) [32]

- For **DogCat**, the citation is:
  > Lee et al. (2018) [32]

- For **Summer Winter**, the citation is:
  > Zhu et al. (2017a) [1]

- For **Yosemite**, the citation is:
  > Zhu et al. (2017a) [1]

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
