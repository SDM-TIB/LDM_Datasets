To extract datasets from the Proceedings of COLING 2014, the 25th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the development of supervised classiiers to predict communicative function labels for English NPs using lexical, morphological, and syntactic features.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of modeling the relationship between the grammar of deiniteness and its communicative functions in a data-driven fashion.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the English deiniteness corpus of Bhatia et al. (2014), which consists of texts from multiple genres annotated with the CommunicativeFunctions of Deiniteness (CFD) scheme.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that this dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for this dataset:

- For the English deiniteness corpus, the citation is:
  > Archna Bhatia, Mandy Simons, Lori Levin, Yulia Tsvetkov, Chris Dyer, and Jordan Bender. *A unified annotation scheme for the semantic/pragmatic components of deiniteness*. In Proc. of LREC. ReykjavAk, Iceland.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
