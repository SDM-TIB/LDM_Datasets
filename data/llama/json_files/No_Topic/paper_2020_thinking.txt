To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Uniied Encoding of Structures in Transition Systems" by Tao Jia, Yong Jiang, Tao Wang, Zhongqiang Huang, Fei Huang, Yuanbin Wu, Xiaoling Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the transition system, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous works and the importance of a unified encoder for transition systems. They hint at the evaluation of their model on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **English Penn Treebank (PTB)**
2. **Universal Dependencies (UD)**
3. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**
4. **JNLPBA corpus**
5. **CHEMDNER corpus**

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PTB**, the citation is:
  > Chen and Manning (2014)

- For **UD**, the citation is:
  > Nivre et al. (2018)

- For **BC2GM**, the citation is:
  > Smith et al. (2008)

- For **JNLPBA**, the citation is:
  > Kim et al. (2004)

- For **CHEMDNER**, the citation is:
  > Krallinger et al. (2015)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
