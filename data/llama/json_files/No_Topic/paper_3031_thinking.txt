To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 604a614, Soia, Bulgaria, August 4-9 2013. c2013 Association for Computational Linguistics" by Haibo Lia, Jing Zhenga, Heng Jia Qi Lia Wen Wangaa, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the proposed Name-aware Machine Translation (MT) approach, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional MT approaches and the importance of integrating name processing into MT models. They hint at the use of parallel corpora and name-tagged data for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Chinese-English MT training corpus**: A large corpus containing parallel sentences in Chinese and English.
2. **Parallel treebank corpora**: A set of corpora containing parallel sentences in Chinese and English, annotated with syntactic and semantic information.
3. **Wikipedia translations**: A dataset containing translations of Wikipedia articles from Chinese to English.
4. **Translation lexicon data**: A dataset containing word translations between Chinese and English.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and evaluation of their Name-aware MT approach.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Chinese-English MT training corpus**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, H. (2008). Statistical machine translation. Springer.
- For **Parallel treebank corpora**, the citation is:
  > Li, X., Strassel, S., Grimes, S., Ismael, S., Ma, X., Bies, A., Xue, N., & Maamouri, M. (2010). Parallel aligned treebank corpora at LDC: methodology, annotation, and integration. In Workshop on Annotation and Exploitation of Parallel Corpora (AEPC).
- For **Wikipedia translations**, the citation is:
  > Wikipedia translations.
- For **Translation lexicon data**, the citation is:
  > Wikipedia translations.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
