To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Contrastive Claims with Semantic Edits" by Christopher Hidey and Kathleen McKeown, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the construction of a dataset of 1,083,520 contrastive comment pairs drawn from Reddit using a predictive model to filter out non-contrastive claims.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of understanding contrast and contradiction in argumentation and mention the need for large, high-quality datasets that illustrate this phenomenon.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Reddit FTFY dataset**: This dataset is constructed by scraping the social media site Reddit for comments containing the acronym FTFY.
2. **AMT dataset**: This dataset is obtained through Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) annotation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and testing their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Reddit FTFY dataset**, the citation is:
  > Christopher Hidey and Kathleen McKeown. *Generating contrastive claims with semantic edits*. Proceedings of NAACL-HLT 2019, pages 1756-1767.

- For **AMT dataset**, the citation is:
  > Christopher Hidey and Kathleen McKeown. *Generating contrastive claims with semantic edits*. Proceedings of NAACL-HLT 2019, pages 1756-1767.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
