To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online List Labeling with Predictions" by Samuel McCauley, Benjamin Moseley, Aidin Niaparast, and Shikha Singh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the list labeling problem, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional list labeling algorithms and the importance of incorporating predictions to improve performance. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Gowalla dataset**: A location-based social networking dataset.
2. **Email-Eu-core dataset**: A dataset for evaluating the performance of list labeling algorithms on email data.
3. **AskUbuntu dataset**: A dataset for evaluating the performance of list labeling algorithms on question-answering data.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Gowalla dataset**, the citation is:
  > Eunjoon Cho, Seth A Myers, and Jure Leskovec. *Friendship and mobility: user movement in location-based social networks*. In Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, pages 1082-1090, 2011.

- For **Email-Eu-core dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **AskUbuntu dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not found

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
