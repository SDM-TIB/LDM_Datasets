To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FEW-SHOT REGRESSION VIA LEARNED BASIS FUNCTIONS" by Yi Loo, Swee Kiat Lim, Gemma Roig, and Ngai-Man Cheung, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the few-shot learning tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous few-shot learning methods and the importance of learning basis functions for regression tasks. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three regression tasks:

1. **Sinusoidal regression task**: This dataset is used for regression tasks involving sinusoidal functions.
2. **1D heat equation task**: This dataset is used for regression tasks involving the 1D heat equation.
3. **2D Gaussian distribution task**: This dataset is used for regression tasks involving 2D Gaussian distributions.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Sinusoidal regression task**, the authors do not provide a specific citation, but it is mentioned that the sinusoidal regression task is similar to the one used in Vinyals et al. (2016).
- For **1D heat equation task**, the authors mention the 1D heat equation task as a variant of the problem.
- For **2D Gaussian distribution task**, the authors mention the 2D Gaussian distribution task as a variant of the problem.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
