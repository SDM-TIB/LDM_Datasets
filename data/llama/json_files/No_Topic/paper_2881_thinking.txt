To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DISENTANGLING ADVERSARIAL ROBUSTNESS IN DI-RECTIONS OF THE DATA MANIFOLD" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of robustness in the data manifold, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of standard adversarial training and the importance of generative models in crafting adversarial examples. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits.
2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of images.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton. ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 1097–1105, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
