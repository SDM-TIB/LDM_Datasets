To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Document Representations for Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval in Low-Resource Settings" by Mahsa Yarmohammadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the cross-lingual information retrieval task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of machine translation and the importance of document representation in cross-lingual information retrieval. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three test collections:

1. **OpenCLIR Evaluation**: This dataset is used for cross-lingual information retrieval evaluation.
2. **Somali, Swahili, and Tagalog speech and text documents**: These datasets are used for speech and text document representation evaluation.
3. **IARPA MATERIAL project**: This dataset is used for cross-lingual information retrieval evaluation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **OpenCLIR Evaluation**, the citation is:
  > https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/openclir-evaluation

- For **Somali, Swahili, and Tagalog speech and text documents**, the citation is:
  > https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/material-project

- For **IARPA MATERIAL project**, the citation is:
  > https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/material-project

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
