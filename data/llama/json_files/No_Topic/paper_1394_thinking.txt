To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Assessment of the Accuracy of Automatic Evaluation in Summarization" by Karolina Owczarzak, Hoa Trang Dang, John M. Conroy, and Ani Nenkova, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of datasets from the 2008-2011 Text Analysis Conference (TAC) for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of datasets from TAC for summarization research.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **TAC 2008-2011 datasets**: This dataset is used for multi-document summarization of news.
2. **TAC 2008-2011 topic-focused summarization datasets**: This dataset is used for topic-focused summarization.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **TAC 2008-2011 datasets**, the citation is:
  > Paul Over and Hoa Dang and Donna Harman. 2007. DUC in context. Inf. Process. Manage. 43(6), 1506â€“1520.

- For **TAC 2008-2011 topic-focused summarization datasets**, the citation is:
  > Chin-Yew Lin and Eduard H. Hovy. 2003. Automatic Evaluation of Summaries Using N-gram Co-occurrence Statistics. Proceedings of HLT-NAACL.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
