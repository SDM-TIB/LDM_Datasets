To extract datasets from the IWPT 2020 Shared Task on Parsing into Enhanced Universal Dependencies, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the proceedings to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The proceedings mention the IWPT 2020 Shared Task on Parsing into Enhanced Universal Dependencies, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.
