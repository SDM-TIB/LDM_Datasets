To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Impact du franAais inclusif sur les outils du TALCyril GrouinUniversitA Paris-Saclay, CNRS, Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire des Sciences du NumAriques (LISN)507 rue du BelvAdA re, 91400 Orsay, France" I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of NLP tools on French inclusive language, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of French inclusive language and the need for NLP tools to handle it. They mention that several processes exist to substitute the generic use of the masculine form, but do not specify any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention a corpus used for the study:

1. **Corpus**: A corpus composed of 1313 words and 56 portions relevant to French inclusive language.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that this corpus was used for the evaluation of NLP tools.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for this corpus:

- For the corpus, the citation is:
  > Grouin, C. (2022). Impact du franAais inclusif sur les outils du TAL. In Actes de la 29e ConfArence sur le Traitement Automatique des Langues Naturelles, Avignon, France, 27 juin au 1er juillet 2022, Volume 1 : confArence principale, pages 126a135.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
