To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoRuSS a a New Prosodically Annotated Corpus of Russian Spontaneous Speech" by T. Kachkovskaia, D. Kocharov, P. Skrelin, and N. Volskaya, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the speech data recording, processing and annotation of a new speech corpus CoRuSS (Corpus of Russian Spontaneous Speech), which is based on connected communicative speech recorded from 60 native Russian male and female speakers of different age groups.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing Russian speech corpora and the need for a new corpus with detailed prosodic annotation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for the corpus. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **ORD (One Day of Speech) corpus**: A large corpus of everyday speech.
2. **PrACS-Russ (Prosodically Annotated Corpus of Spoken Russian)**: A corpus of monologue speech with limited prosodic annotation.
3. **CORPRES (Corpus of Professionally Read Speech)**: A corpus of professionally read speech.
4. **aRuSpeecha (Corpus of monologues)**: A corpus of transcribed recordings produced by 220 speakers.
5. **CoRuSS (Corpus of Russian Spontaneous Speech)**: The new corpus described in the paper, with detailed prosodic annotation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation and comparison.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ORD**, the citation is:
  > Bogdanova-Beglarian et al. (2015). The One Day of Speech corpus: Pho-netic and syntactic studies of everyday spoken russian. In 17th International Conference on Speech and Computer, SPECOM 2015, volume 9319 of LNAI, pages 429-437. Springer.

- For **PrACS-Russ**, the citation is:
  > Kibrik and Podlesskaya (2009). Rasskazy o snov-idenijakh. Korpusnoe issledovanie ustnogo russkogo diskursa. Jazyki slavyanskoj kultury.

- For **CORPRES**, the citation is:
  > Skrelin et al. (2010). Corpres a corpus of russian professionally read speech. In 13th International Conference Text, Speech and Dialogue, TSD 2010, volume 6231 of LNCS, pages 392-399. Springer.

- For **aRuSpeecha**, the citation is:
  > Krivnova (2013). Russkij rechevoj korpus ruspeech. In Proceedings of the VII International Scientific Conference aFonetika segodniaa, pages 54-56.

- For **CoRuSS**, the citation is:
  > Kachkovskaia et al. (paper title not found)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
