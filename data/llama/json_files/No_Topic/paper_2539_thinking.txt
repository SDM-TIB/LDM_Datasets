To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mildly Non-Projective Dependency Grammar" by Marco Kuhlmann, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the extraction of lexicalized linear context-free rewriting systems from dependency treebanks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the formalism for non-projective dependency grammar based on linear context-free rewriting systems, but no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following dependency treebanks:

1. **Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank**
2. **Prague Dependency Treebank of Czech**
3. **Danish Dependency Treebank**
4. **Slovene Dependency Treebank**
5. **Metu-SabancA treebank of Turkish**

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank**, the citation is:
  > HajiEc et al. (2004)

- For **Prague Dependency Treebank of Czech**, the citation is:
  > B A ohmovA a et al. (2003)

- For **Danish Dependency Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Kromann (2003)

- For **Slovene Dependency Treebank**, the citation is:
  > DEzeroski et al. (2006)

- For **Metu-SabancA treebank of Turkish**, the citation is:
  > Oiazer et al. (2003)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
