To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cycle-Consistent GAN Front-End to Improve ASRobustness to Perturbed Speech" by Sri Harsha Dumpala, Imran Sheikh, Rupayan Chakraborty, and Sunil Kumar Kopparapu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of two spontaneous speech datasets, namely, AMI meeting corpus and Buckeye corpus of conversational speech.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of analyzing the effect of emotional coloring of speech on ASR performance and the analysis of the effect of voice qualities on ASR performance.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **AMI meeting corpus**: This dataset is used for laughter speech.
2. **Buckeye corpus of conversational speech**: This dataset is used for creaky speech.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the proposed front-end system.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **AMI meeting corpus**, the citation is:
  > Iain McCowan, Jean Carletta, W Kraaij, S Ashby, S Bourban, M Flynn, M Guillemot, T Hain, J Kadlec, V Karaiskos, et al. The ami meeting corpus. In Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Methods and Techniques in Behavioral Research, volume 88, page 100, 2005.

- For **Buckeye corpus of conversational speech**, the citation is:
  > Mark A Pitt, Laura Dilley, Keith Johnson, Scott Kiesling, William Raymond, Elizabeth Hume, and Eric Fosler-Lussier. Buckeye corpus of conversational speech (2nd release)[www.buckeyecorpus.osu.edu] columbus, oh: Department of psychology. Ohio State University (Distributor), 2007.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
