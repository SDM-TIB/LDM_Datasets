To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Neural Verb Lexicon Model with Source-side Syntactic Context for String-to-Tree Machine Translation" by Maria Nadejde, Alexandra Birch, and Philipp Koehn, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various datasets for machine translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of string-to-tree MT systems and the importance of verb translation. They hint at the evaluation of these systems on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **WMT15 parallel data**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the string-to-tree MT system.
2. **newstest2013, newstest2014, and newstest2015**: These datasets are used for evaluation of the verb translation model.
3. **newstest2013-2015**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the verb translation model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WMT15 parallel data**, the citation is:
  > O. Bojar, R. Chatterjee, C. Federmann, B. Had-dow, M. Huck, C. Hokamp, P. Koehn, V. Logacheva, C. Monz, M. Negri, M. Post, C. Scarton, L. Specia, and M. Turchi. *Findings of the 2015 workshop on statistical machine translation*. In Proceedings of the Tenth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, Lisbon, Portugal, September 2015, pp. 1-46.

- For **newstest2013, newstest2014, and newstest2015**, the citation is:
  > O. Bojar, R. Chatterjee, C. Federmann, B. Had-dow, M. Huck, C. Hokamp, P. Koehn, V. Logacheva, C. Monz, M. Negri, M. Post, C. Scarton, L. Specia, and M. Turchi. *Findings of the 2015 workshop on statistical machine translation*. In Proceedings of the Tenth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, Lisbon, Portugal, September 2015, pp. 1-46.

- For **newstest2013-2015**, the citation is:
  > O. Bojar, R. Chatterjee, C. Federmann, B. Had-dow, M. Huck, C. Hokamp, P. Koehn, V. Logacheva, C. Monz, M. Negri, M. Post, C. Scarton, L. Specia, and M. Turchi. *Findings of the 2015 workshop on statistical machine translation*. In Proceedings of the Tenth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, Lisbon, Portugal, September 2015, pp. 1-46.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
