To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Annotation, Analysis and Comparison:A Multilingual and Cross-lingual Text Analytics Toolkit" by Lei Zhang and Achim Rettinger, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the toolkit's goal of facilitating multilingual and cross-lingual access to data, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of multilingual and cross-lingual text analytics and the need for systems that can overcome language barriers. They hint at the use of Wikipedia as a knowledge base for their toolkit.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention Wikipedia as the central knowledge base for their toolkit.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For Wikipedia, the citation is:
  > Milne and Witten (2008) could improve the wikiication service significantly by viewing wikiication even more as a supervised machine learning task: Wikipedia is used here not only as a source of information to point to, but also as training data to identify always the appropriate link.

- For the Wikipedia articles in English, German, Spanish, and French, the citation is:
  > Table 1 shows the statistics of the Wikipedia articles in English, German, Spanish and French as well as the cross-language links between them in these languages extracted from Wikipedia snapshots of May 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
