To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discourse Sense Classiication from Scratch using Focused RNNs" by Gregor Weiss and Marko Bajec, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the CoNLL 2016 Shared Task and the use of PDTB and CDTB datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing systems for discourse parsing and the focus on sense classification.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB)**: A dataset for shallow discourse parsing.
2. **Chinese Discourse TreeBank (CDTB)**: A dataset for shallow discourse parsing in Chinese.
3. **CoNLL 2016 Shared Task datasets**: A dataset for sense classification of multi-lingual shallow discourse relations.
4. **Wikinews datasets**: A dataset for sense classification of multi-lingual shallow discourse relations.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PDTB**, the citation is:
  > Rashmi Prasad, Nikhil Dinesh, Alan Lee, Eleni Milt-sakaki, Livio Robaldo, Aravind Joshi, and BonnieWebber. 2008. The Penn Discourse TreeBank 2.0.Proc. Sixth Int. Conf. Lang. Resour. Eval., pages2961a2968.

- For **CDTB**, the citation is:
  > Yuping Zhou and Nianwen Xue. 2012. PDTB-styleDiscourse Annotation of Chinese Text. Proc. 50thAnnu. Meet. Assoc. Comput. Linguist. (Volume 1Long Pap., (July):69a77.

- For **CoNLL 2016 Shared Task datasets**, the citation is:
  > Nianwen Xue, Hwee Tou Ng, Sameer Pradhan, RashmiPrasad, Christopher Bryant, and Attapol T. Ruther-ford. 2015. The CoNLL-2015 Shared Task on Shal-low Discourse Parsing. In Proc. Ninet. Conf. Com-put. Nat. Lang. Learn. Shar. Task, pages 1a16.

- For **Wikinews datasets**, the citation is:
  > Martin Potthast, Tim Gollub, Francisco Rangel, PaoloRosso, Efstathios Stamatatos, and Benno Stein.Improving the Reproducibility of PANas2014.Shared Tasks: Plagiarism Detection, Author Iden-tiication, and Author Proiling.In EvangelosKanoulas, Mihai Lupu, Paul Clough, Mark Sander-son, Mark Hall, Allan Hanbury, and Elaine Toms,editors, Inf. Access Eval. meets Multilinguality, Mul-timodality, Vis. 5th Int. Conf. CLEF Initiat. (CLEF14), pages 268a299, Berlin Heidelberg New York,sep. Springer.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
