To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Samsung: Align-and-Differentiate Approach to Semantic Textual Similarity" by Lushan Han, Justin Martineau, Doreen Cheng and Christopher Thomas, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the Align-and-Differentiate approach on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of measuring semantic similarity between two sentences using a scale ranging from 0 to 5.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SemEval-2015 Task 2**: This dataset is used for the evaluation of the Align-and-Differentiate approach.
2. **SemEval-2015 Task 6**: This dataset is used for the evaluation of the Align-and-Differentiate approach.
3. **SemEval-2014 Task 10**: This dataset is used for the evaluation of the Align-and-Differentiate approach.
4. **UMBC WebBase corpus**: This dataset is used for the evaluation of the Align-and-Differentiate approach.
5. **Stanford POS tagger**: This dataset is used for the evaluation of the Align-and-Differentiate approach.
6. **Headlines dataset**: This dataset is used for the evaluation of the Align-and-Differentiate approach.
7. **Images dataset**: This dataset is used for the evaluation of the Align-and-Differentiate approach.
8. **Students dataset**: This dataset is used for the evaluation of the Align-and-Differentiate approach.
9. **Forums dataset**: This dataset is used for the evaluation of the Align-and-Differentiate approach.
10. **Beliefs dataset**: This dataset is used for the evaluation of the Align-and-Differentiate approach.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
