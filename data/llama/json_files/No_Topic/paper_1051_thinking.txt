To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meeting the 2020 Duolingo Challenge on a Shoestring" by Tadashi Nomoto, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of public dataset from Duolingo, containing some 4 million pairs of sentences, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of two systems, gFCONV and c-VAE, which are neural models that aim to disrupt a sentence representation the encoder generates with an eye on increasing the diversity of sentences that emerge.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named datasets:

1. **Duolingo dataset**: This dataset contains 4 million pairs of sentences.
2. **MeCab dataset**: This dataset is used for tokenizing sentences in Japanese.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Duolingo dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Mayhew, K. Bicknell, C. Brust, B. McDowell, W. Monroe, and B. Settles. *Simultaneous translation and paraphrase for language education*. In Proceedings of the ACL Workshop on Neural Generation and Translation (WNGT), pages 129a133, 2020.

- For **MeCab dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
