To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DEBIASING PRETRAINED TEXT ENCODERS BY PAY-ING ATTENTION TO PAYING ATTENTION" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the debiasing task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing debiasing methods and the importance of attention-based debiasing. They hint at the evaluation of their method on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **StereotypeSet**: A benchmark dataset for measuring bias in pre-trained language models.
2. **Crows-Pairs**: A benchmark dataset for measuring bias in pre-trained language models.
3. **GLUE**: A benchmark dataset for natural language understanding tasks.
4. **HateXplain**: A dataset for hate speech detection.
5. **News-commentary-v15**: A dataset used for evaluating the performance of the text encoder.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their method, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **StereotypeSet**, the citation is:
  > Nadeem et al. (2020) Stereoset: Measuring stereotypical bias in pretrained language models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.09456, 2020.

- For **Crows-Pairs**, the citation is:
  > Nangia et al. (2020) Crows-pairs: A challengedataset for measuring social biases in masked language models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.09456, 2020.

- For **GLUE**, the citation is:
  > Devlin et al. (2018) BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.04805, 2018.

- For **HateXplain**, the citation is:
  > Mathew et al. (2021) Reducing gender bias in abusive language detection. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 2799-2804, 2018.

- For **News-commentary-v15**, the citation is:
  > Nalisnick et al. (2016) Improving document ranking with dual word embeddings. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference Companion on World Wide Web, pp. 83-84, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
