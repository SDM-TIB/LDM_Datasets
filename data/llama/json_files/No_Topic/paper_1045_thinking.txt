To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Animacy Classiication" by Samuel R. Bowman, Harshit Chopra, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of an annotated corpus for animacy classification, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the animacy hierarchy and the importance of annotating noun phrases with animacy tags. They mention the work of Zaenen et al. (2004) and the Switchboard corpus.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Switchboard corpus**: This corpus is used for animacy annotation.
2. **Hand-parsed Switchboard corpus**: This is an annotated subset of the Switchboard corpus.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and testing their model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Switchboard corpus**, the citation is:
  > Zaenen, A., Meehan, K., & Zee, E. (2004). Animacy encoding in English: why and how. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics Workshop on Discourse Annotation (pp. 1-8).

- For **Hand-parsed Switchboard corpus**, the citation is:
  > Calhoun, S., Carletta, J., Brenier, J. M., Mayo, N., Jurafsky, D., Steedman, M., & Beaver, D. (2010). The NXT-format Switchboard Corpus. Language Resources and Evaluation, 44(4), 349-364.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
