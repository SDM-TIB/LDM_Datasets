To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Early Rumour Detection" by Kaimin Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of microblog data sets from WEIBO and TWITTER, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of early rumour detection and the potential impact of malicious rumours on social media.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **WEIBO dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluation on WEIBO.
2. **TWITTER dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluation on TWITTER.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WEIBO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ma et al. (2016) developed a standard microblog data set from WEIBO.

- For **TWITTER dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zu-biaga et al. (2016) developed a standard microblog data set from TWITTER.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
