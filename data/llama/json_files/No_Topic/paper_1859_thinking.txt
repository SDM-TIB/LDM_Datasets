To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Lexicon-Based Review Classification by Merging and Revising Sentiment Dictionaries" by Heeryon Cho, Jong-Seok Lee, and Songkuk Kim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of sentiment dictionaries on a book review dataset, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of sentiment dictionaries in opinion mining and sentiment analysis, and mention various lexical resources that define sentiment scores/categories.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Amazon book reviews dataset**: A dataset containing 90,000 Amazon book reviews, used to construct a positive/negative review dataset for sentiment dictionary evaluation.
2. **SentiSense**: A sentiment dictionary that defines sentiment scores/categories.
3. **SentiWordNet**: A sentiment dictionary that defines sentiment scores/categories.
4. **Micro-WNOp**: A sentiment dictionary that defines sentiment scores/categories.
5. **Opinion Lexicon**: A sentiment dictionary that defines sentiment scores/categories.
6. **General Inquirer**: A sentiment dictionary that defines sentiment scores/categories.
7. **AFINN**: A sentiment dictionary that defines sentiment scores/categories.
8. **WordNet-Affect**: A sentiment dictionary that defines sentiment scores/categories.
9. **Subjectivity Lexicon**: A sentiment dictionary that defines sentiment scores/categories.
10. **General Inquirer**: A sentiment dictionary that defines sentiment scores/categories.
11. **JNLPBA**: A dataset containing proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
12. **CHEMDNER**: A dataset containing drugs and chemicals.
13. **BC2GM**: A dataset containing gene mentions.
14. **JNLPBA corpus**: A dataset containing proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
15. **CHEMDNER corpus**: A dataset containing drugs and chemicals.
16. **BC2GM corpus**: A dataset containing gene mentions.
17. **SentiNet**: A dataset containing sentiment annotations.
18. **Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW)**: A dataset containing affective norms for English words.
19. **Harvard IV-4**: A dataset containing affective norms for English words.
