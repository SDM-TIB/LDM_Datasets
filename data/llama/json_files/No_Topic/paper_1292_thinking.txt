To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Literary translation as a three-stage process: machine translation, post-editing and revision" by Lieve Macken, Bram Vanroy, Luca Desmet and Arda Tezcan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of different automatic metrics to measure the (dis)similarity between the consecutive versions of the texts produced in the target language.

In the **methods section**, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **English-Dutch literary translations**: This dataset is used for the study of machine translation of literary texts.
2. **DeepL**: This is a machine translation system used as the MT engine for translating an English novel into Dutch.
3. **YouAlign2**: This is a tool used to align all versions of the text at the sentence level.
4. **AwesomeAlign**: This is a tool used to automatically create word alignments.
5. **SCATE MT error taxonomy**: This is a taxonomy used to annotate errors in machine translation output.
6. **WebAnno**: This is a tool used for manual annotation of the dataset.
7. **Nuanxed**: This is a book translation company that provided the dataset for the study.
8. **Gutenberg**: This is a dataset of English literary classics used for comparison.
9. **JNLPBA**: This is a dataset of annotated proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
10. **BC2GM**: This is a dataset of annotated gene mentions.
11. **CHEMDNER**: This is a dataset of annotated drugs and chemicals.
12. **Alice's Adventures in Wonderland**: This is a children's book used for the study of post-editing and revision.
13. **The Girl on the Train**: This is a thriller novel used for the study of post-editing and revision.
14. **Sense and Sensibility**: This is a novel used for the study of machine translation quality.
