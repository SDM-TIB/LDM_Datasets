To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Painless Labeling with Application to Text Mining" by Sajib Dasgupta, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of labeled data for text mining tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of labeled data availability for natural language domains and the need for efficient labeling methods.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three text classification tasks:

1. **Gender Classification**: A dataset containing 5000 blog articles, randomly selected from a larger dataset.
2. **Spam Classification**: A dataset containing 5000 emails, randomly selected from a larger dataset.
3. **Sentiment Classification**: A dataset containing 2000 product reviews, annotated with positive and negative sentiment labels.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their labeling system.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Gender Classification**, the citation is:
  > Schler et al. (2006) for the blog dataset

- For **Spam Classification**, the citation is:
  > Metsis et al. (2006) for the Enron spam dataset

- For **Sentiment Classification**, the citation is:
  > Pang et al. (2002) for the movie review dataset

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
