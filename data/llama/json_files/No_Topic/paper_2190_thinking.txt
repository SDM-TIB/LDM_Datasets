To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Remote Heart Rate Measurement From Face Videos Under Realistic Situations" by Xiaobai Li, Jie Chen, Guoying Zhao, Matti Pietikäinen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the MAHNOB-HCI database and the VideoHR database.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous methods for remote heart rate measurement from face videos and the potential of using ordinary cameras for this task.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **MAHNOB-HCI**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method under realistic HCI situations.
2. **VideoHR**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method on a simple self-collected database.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their methods, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MAHNOB-HCI**, the citation is:
  > M. Soleymani, J. Lichtenauer, T. Pun, and M. Pantic. *A multi-modal database for affect recognition and implicit tagging*. IEEE Trans. on Affective Computing, 2(2), 2012, 147–155. https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2011.21

- For **VideoHR**, the citation is:
  > Not found

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
