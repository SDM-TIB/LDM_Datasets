To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TRAINING WITH GROWING SETS:A SIMPLE ALTERNATIVE TO CURRICULUM LEARNINGAND SELF PACED LEARNING" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the comparison of methods for training neural networks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **methods section**, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **UCI repository datasets**: The authors mention that they tested their method on 36 datasets retrieved from the UCI repository, including:
	* laborzoolymphirishepatitis
	* audiology
	* autosglasssonar
	* heart-statlog
	* breast-cancer
	* primary-tumor
	* ionosphere
	* colic
	* vote
	* balance-scales
	* soybean
	* credit-ab
	* breast-wdiabetes
	* vehicle
	* anneal
	* vowel
	* credit-g
	* col
	* 10segments
	* splicing
	* kr-vs-kp
	* hypothyroids
	* sick
	* abalone
2. **Vehicle dataset**: The authors mention that they used the vehicle dataset for their experiments.
3. **Waveform dataset**: The authors mention that they used the waveform dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **UCI repository datasets**, the citations are not explicitly mentioned in the paper, but the datasets are listed in the **Appendix B** section.
- For **Vehicle dataset**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For **Waveform dataset**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
