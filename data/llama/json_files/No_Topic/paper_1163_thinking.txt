To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Layer rotation: a surprisingly simple indicator of generalization in deep networks" by Simon Carbonnelle and Christophe De Vleeschouwer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various datasets for experiments, but I need to look for specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of generalization in deep networks and mention that the experiments are conducted on five different tasks which vary in network architecture and dataset complexity.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for experiments. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class.
3. **Tiny ImageNet**: A dataset of 100,000 224x224 color images in 1000 classes, with 100 images per class.
4. **C10-CNN1**: A dataset of 50,000 224x224 color images in 10 classes, with 5,000 images per class.
5. **C100-resnet**: A dataset of 50,000 224x224 color images in 100 classes, with 500 images per class.
6. **C10-CNN2**: A dataset of 50,000 224x224 color images in 10 classes, with 5,000 images per class.
7. **C100-WRN**: A dataset of 50,000 224x224 color images in 100 classes, with 500 images per class.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
