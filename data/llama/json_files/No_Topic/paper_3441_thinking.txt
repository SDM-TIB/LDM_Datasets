To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Essay on Self-explanatory Computational Intelligence:A Linguistic Model of Data Processing Systems" by Jose M. Alonso, Gracian Trivino, and others, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of Natural Language for describing computational processes, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenge of building self-explanatory computational systems and the importance of using Natural Language for describing their internal processes. They hint at the use of linguistic descriptions of data, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Linguistic Description of Complex Phenomena (Trivino and Sugeno, 2013)**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed linguistic model of data processing systems.
2. **Argument Technology (Walton et al., 2008)**: This dataset is used for evaluating the argumentation schemes used in the proposed model.
3. **Natural Language Generation (Reiter and Dale, 2000)**: This dataset is used for evaluating the natural language generation capabilities of the proposed model.
4. **Linguistic Descriptions of Data (Ramos-Soto et al., 2016)**: This dataset is used for evaluating the linguistic descriptions of data used in the proposed model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Linguistic Description of Complex Phenomena**, the citation is:
  > Gracian Trivino and M. Sugeno. 2013. Towards linguistic descriptions of phenomena. International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, 54(1):22a34.

- For **Argument Technology**, the citation is:
  > David Walton, C. Reed, and F. Macagno. 2008. Argumentation Schemes. Cambridge University Press.

- For **Natural Language Generation**, the citation is:
  > Peter L. Reiter and R. Dale. 2000. Building natural language generation systems, volume 33. MIT Press.

- For **Linguistic Descriptions of Data**, the citation is:
  > A. Ramos-Soto, A. BugarA An, and S. Barro. 2016. On the role of linguistic descriptions of data in the building of natural language generation systems. Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 285:31a51.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
