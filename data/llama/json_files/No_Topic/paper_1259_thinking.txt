To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Authorship Identiication for Literary Book Recommendations" by Haifa Alharthi, Diana Inkpen, and Stan Szpakowicz, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed system using the Litrec dataset, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of reading for pleasure and the decline of reading habits, but no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the Litrec dataset:

1. **Litrec dataset**: This dataset contains data on 1,927 users who rated 3,710 literary works.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the Litrec dataset was used for evaluation of the proposed system.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Litrec dataset:

- For **Litrec dataset**, the citation is:
  > Paula Cristina Vaz, David Martins de Matos, Bruno Martins, and Pavel Calado. *LitRec vs. MovieLens a A Comparative Study*. In KDIR 2012 a Proc. International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval, Barcelona, Spain, 4-7 October, 2012, pages 370a373.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
