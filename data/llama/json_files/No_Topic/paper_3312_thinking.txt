To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING OF MOTION-INFORMED LATENTS" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of Objectron and UCF101 datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the success of self-supervised instance recognition methods and the need for more powerful visual representations.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Objectron**: A large-scale dataset of object-centric videos in the wild with pose annotations.
2. **UCF101**: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Objectron**, the citation is:
  > Adel Ahmadyan, Liangkai Zhang, Jianing Wei, Artsiom Ablavatski, and Matthias Grundmann. *Objectron: A large scale dataset of object-centric videos in the wild with pose annotations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.09988, 2020.

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
