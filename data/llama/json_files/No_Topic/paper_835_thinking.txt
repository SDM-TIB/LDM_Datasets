To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Actes de la confArence conjointe JEP-TALN-RECITAL 2016, volume 1 : JEP182Disfluences dans le vieillissement "normal" et la maladie daAlzheimer : indices segmentaux, suprasegmentaux et gestuels" by Diane Caussade et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the analysis and comparison of multimodal language productions by 10 persons with Alzheimeras disease (AD) matched to 10 controls. The introduction also mentions the use of various measures at the segmental and suprasegmental levels.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of analyzing and comparing multimodal language productions in Alzheimeras disease. They also mention the use of various measures, including lexical, phonetic, and gestural markers.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for analysis. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MMSE**: The Mini-Mental State Examination is a widely used test for cognitive impairment.
2. **NNSE**: The Neurological Examination is a comprehensive assessment of neurological function.
3. **NSE**: The Neurological Scale Examination is a standardized assessment of neurological function.
4. **Groupe Patient**: A group of 10 women with Alzheimeras disease.
5. **Groupe ContrA le**: A group of 10 controls matched to the Groupe Patient in terms of age and sex.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for analysis.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MMSE**, the citation is:
  > Folstein M.F., Folstein S.E. & McHugh P.R. *Mini-Mental State*. Journal of Psychiatric Research, 12(3), 189-198, 1975.

- For **NNSE**, the citation is:
  > Not mentioned in the paper.

- For **NSE**, the citation is:
  > Not mentioned in the paper.

- For **Groupe Patient**, the citation is:
  > Not mentioned in the paper.

- For **Groupe ContrA le**, the citation is:
  > Not mentioned in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
