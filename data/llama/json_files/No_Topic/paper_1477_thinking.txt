    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Debiasing Averaged Stochastic Gradient Descent to handle missing values" by Aude Sportisse, Claire Boyer, Aymeric Dieuleveut, and Julie Josse, I will follow a systematic approach.

    First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of averaged stochastic gradient descent algorithms for handling missing values in linear models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

    In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the problem of missing values in large-scale data analysis and the need for robust algorithms to handle them. They mention that the dataset TraumaBase R is used to assist doctors in making real-time decisions in the management of severely traumatized patients.

    Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

    1. **TraumaBase R dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithm on real-world data.
    2. **Superconductivity dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithm on a synthetic dataset.

    In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

    Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

    - For **TraumaBase R dataset**, the citation is:
      > Not found

    - For **Superconductivity dataset**, the citation is:
      > Not found

    After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
