To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Event Temporal Relation Classification via AuxiliaryLabel-Aware Contrastive Learning" by Tiesen Sun, Lishuang Li, and others, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the event temporal relation classification task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional event temporal relation classification methods and the importance of learning semantic information from golden temporal relation labels. They hint at the evaluation of their proposed method on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **TB-Dense**: A densely annotated dataset for the event temporal relation classification task.
2. **MATRES**: A refined dataset from TimeBank and TempEval, containing 275 documents with 4 temporal relations.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their proposed method, TempACL.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **TB-Dense**, the citation is:
  > Cassidy et al. (2014) An annotation framework for dense event ordering.

- For **MATRES**, the citation is:
  > Ning et al. (2018) A multi-axis annotation scheme for event temporal relations.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
