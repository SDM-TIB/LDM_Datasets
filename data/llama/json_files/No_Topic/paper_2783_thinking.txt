To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Co-reference Resolution of Elided Subjects and Possessive Pronouns in Spanish-English Statistical Machine Translation" by Annette Rios and Don Tuggener, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the method for the language pair Spanish-English, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the problems of elided subjects and morphological underspecification of pronouns when translating from pro-drop languages. They hint at the use of existing datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Se-meval 2010 shared task data set**: This dataset is used for co-reference resolution for Spanish.
2. **AnCora treebank**: This dataset is used for training the parser and the co-reference system.
3. **NC11 corpus**: This corpus is used for training and testing the model.
4. **LDC Gigaword corpus**: This corpus is used as additional training material for the language model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their method, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Se-meval 2010 shared task data set**, the citation is:
  > http://stel.ub.edu/semeval2010-coref/

- For **AnCora treebank**, the citation is:
  > TaulA e et al., 2008

- For **NC11 corpus**, the citation is:
  > http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/

- For **LDC Gigaword corpus**, the citation is:
  > https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2007T07

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
