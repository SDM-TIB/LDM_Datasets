To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty-Aware Prediction for Graph Neural Networks" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of six real network datasets for node classification prediction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of graph neural networks (GNNs) in handling different types of uncertainties associated with class probabilities.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention six real network datasets:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset.
2. **Citeseer**: A citation network dataset.
3. **Pubmed**: A citation network dataset.
4. **Coauthor Physics**: A co-authorship graph dataset.
5. **Amazon Computer**: A co-purchase graph dataset.
6. **Amazon Photo**: A co-purchase graph dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for node classification prediction and out-of-distribution detection.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Brody et al. (2009) - Cora: A citation network dataset.

- For **Citeseer**, the citation is:
  > Brody et al. (2009) - Citeseer: A citation network dataset.

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is:
  > Brody et al. (2009) - Pubmed: A citation network dataset.

- For **Coauthor Physics**, the citation is:
  > Shchur et al. (2018) - Coauthor Physics: A co-authorship graph dataset.

- For **Amazon Computer**, the citation is:
  > McAuley et al. (2015) - Amazon Computer: A co-purchase graph dataset.

- For **Amazon Photo**, the citation is:
  > McAuley et al. (2015) - Amazon Photo: A co-purchase graph dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
