To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AnaLog: Testing Analytical and Deductive Logic Learnability in Language Models" by Samuel Ryb, Mario Giulianelli, Arabella Sinclair, and Raquel Fern√°ndez, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **dataset design and construction section** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The authors describe the AnaLog dataset, which is an NLI task designed to probe models for analytical and deductive logical reasoning capabilities.

In the **dataset design and construction section**, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **LAKNLI dataset**: This dataset is used as a baseline for the AnaLog task.
2. **AnaLog dataset**: This is the main dataset described in the paper, which contains 24,000 items with premises, hypotheses, and logical relations.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their descriptions from the paper.
