To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MoRTy: Unsupervised Learning of Task-specialized Word Embeddings by Autoencoding" by Nils Rethmeier and Barbara Plank, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the MoRTy method on 18 publicly available benchmark tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of pre-trained word embeddings and the need for task-specialized word embeddings, which implies the use of datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **WikiText**: A large corpus used for training and evaluation of word embeddings.
2. **FastText**: A word embedding method used for training and evaluation.
3. **GloVe**: A word embedding method used for training and evaluation.
4. **Common Crawl**: A large corpus used for training and evaluation of word embeddings.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of the MoRTy method, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WikiText**, the citation is:
  > Merity et al. (2016) created a large corpus of text, which is used for training and evaluation of word embeddings.

- For **FastText**, the citation is:
  > Bojanowski et al. (2016) developed the FastText algorithm, which is used for training and evaluation.

- For **GloVe**, the citation is:
  > Pennington et al. (2014) developed the GloVe algorithm, which is used for training and evaluation.

- For **Common Crawl**, the citation is:
  > The Common Crawl dataset is a large corpus of web pages, which is used for training and evaluation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
