To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Replicating and Extending aBecause Their Treebanks Leaka:Graph Isomorphism, Covariants, and Parser Performance" by Mark Anderson, Anders SA gaard, and Carlos GA omez-RodrA Aguez, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of parser performance using linear regression models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of graph isomorphism (DUG) and directed graph isomorphism (DUG) as measures of parser performance, and mention the use of Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CoNLL 2018 shared task data**: This dataset is used for parser performance evaluation.
2. **CoNLL18 UDPipe 1.2 and 2.0 data**: These datasets are used for parser performance evaluation using UDPipe 1.2 and 2.0 models.
3. **CoNLL18 UDPipe 1.2 and 2.0 extended data**: This dataset is used for parser performance evaluation using UDPipe 1.2 and 2.0 models.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CoNLL 2018 shared task data**, the citation is:
  > Zeman et al. (2018) CoNLL 2018 shared task: Multilingual parsing from raw text to Universal Dependencies. In Proceedings of the CoNLL 2018 Shared Task: Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies, pages 1-21, Brussels, Belgium.

- For **CoNLL18 UDPipe 1.2 and 2.0 data**, the citation is:
  > Straka et al. (2016) Ud-pipe: Trainable pipeline for processing CoNLL-U files performing tokenization, morphological analysis, POS tagging and parsing. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LRECa16), pages 4290-4297.

- For **CoNLL18 UDPipe 1.2 and 2.0 extended data**, the citation is:
  > Straka et al. (2016) Ud-pipe: Trainable pipeline for processing CoNLL-U files performing tokenization, morphological analysis, POS tagging and parsing. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LRECa16), pages 4290-4297.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
