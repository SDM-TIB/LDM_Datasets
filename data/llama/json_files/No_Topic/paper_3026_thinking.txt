To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-lingual RDF Thesauri Interlinking" by Tatiana Lesnikova, Jerome Euzenat, and Jerome Euzenat, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of machine translation for interlinking concepts, i.e., generic entities named with a common noun or term.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of interlinking lexical resources in RDF and the need for techniques to deal with multilinguality.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **TheSoz multilingual thesaurus**: This dataset is used for the first experiment involving concepts from the TheSoz thesaurus in three languages: English, French, and German.
2. **EuroVoc**: This dataset is used for the second experiment involving concepts from EuroVoc and AGROVOC in English and Chinese respectively.
3. **AGROVOC**: This dataset is used for the second experiment involving concepts from EuroVoc and AGROVOC in English and Chinese respectively.
4. **XLore**: This dataset is mentioned as a resource described in the English and Chinese languages.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **TheSoz**, the citation is:
  > Zapilko et al. (2013) TheSoz: A SKOS Representation of the Thesaurus for the Social Sciences. Semantic Web journal (SWJ), 4(3):257a263.

- For **EuroVoc**, the citation is:
  > EuroVoc. (n.d.). EuroVoc. Retrieved from <https://eurovoc.europa.eu/>

- For **AGROVOC**, the citation is:
  > EuroVoc. (n.d.). AGROVOC. Retrieved from <https://aims.fao.org/standards/agrovoc/concept-scheme>

- For **XLore**, the citation is:
  > Wang et al. (2013) XLore: A Large-scale English-Chinese Bilingual Knowledge Graph. In International Semantic Web Conference (Posters & Demos), volume 1035 of CEUR Workshop Proceedings, pages 121a124.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
