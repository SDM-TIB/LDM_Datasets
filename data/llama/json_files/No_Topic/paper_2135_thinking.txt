To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PTB Graph Parsing with Tree Approximation" by Yoshihide Kato and Shigeki Matsubara, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the Penn Treebank (PTB) and its graph-structured representations, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous parsing methods and the importance of nonlocal dependency identification. They hint at the evaluation of these methods on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the PTB dataset was used for evaluation of their method.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PTB dataset:

- For **PTB**, the citation is:
  > Mitchell P. Marcus, Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a large annotated corpus of English: the Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):310â€“330, 1993.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
