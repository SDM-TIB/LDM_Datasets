To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-Parametric Structure-Based Calibration of Radially Symmetric Cameras" by Federico Camposeco, Torsten Sattler, and Marc Pollefeys, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the calibration of radially symmetric cameras, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of calibrating wide-field of view (WFOV) cameras, which are used in various applications such as visual navigation for robots and autonomous vehicles. They hint at the use of Structure from Motion (SfM) models and image-based localization methods.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for calibration. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SfM model**: A large-scale reconstruction obtained from regular images.
2. **Calibration pattern**: A synthetic calibration pattern with 48 corners.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for calibration.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SfM model**, the citation is:
  > Not specified

- For **Calibration pattern**, the citation is:
  > Not specified

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
