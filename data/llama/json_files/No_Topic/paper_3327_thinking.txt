To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Impact of Typicality for Informative Representative Selection" by Jawadul H. Bappy, Sujoy Paul, Ertem Tuncel and Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of models on various datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of selecting informative samples from a huge pool of training data, which implies the use of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MSRC**: A dataset used for scene-object and activity-object classiication.
2. **MIT-67 Indoor**: A dataset used for scene-object and activity-object classiication.
3. **MSRC II**: A dataset used for scene-object and activity-object classiication.
4. **MIT-67**: A dataset used for scene-object and activity-object classiication.
5. **CAD-120**: A dataset used for activity-object classiication.
6. **Scene-15**: A dataset used for scene classiication.
7. **VOC2010**: A dataset used for object recognition.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MSRC**, the citation is:
  > T. Malisiewicz and A. A. Efros. Improving spatial support for objects via multiple segmentations. In BMVC, volume 29, pages 78a1, 2007.

- For **MIT-67 Indoor**, the citation is:
  > A. Quattoni and A. Torralba. Recognizing indoor scenes. In CVPR, 2009.

- For **MSRC II**, the citation is:
  > T. Malisiewicz and A. A. Efros. Improving spatial support for objects via multiple segmentations. In BMVC, volume 29, pages 78a1, 2007.

- For **MIT-67**, the citation is:
  > A. Quattoni and A. Torralba. Recognizing indoor scenes. In CVPR, 2009.

- For **CAD-120**, the citation is:
  > H. S. Koppula, R. Gupta, and A. Saxena. Learning human activities and object affordances from rgb-d videos. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 2013.

- For **Scene-15**, the citation is:
  > S. Lazebnik, C. Schmid, and J. Ponce. Beyond bags of features: Spatial pyramid matching for recognizing natural scene categories. In CVPR, 2006.

- For **VOC2010**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. The pascal visual object classes (voc) challenge. IJCV, 2010.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
