To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BUCC2017: A Hybrid Approach for Identifying Parallel Sentences in Comparable Corpora" by Sainik Kumar Mahata, Dipankar Das, and Santanu Pal, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of comparable corpora for parallel sentence identification, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of parallel corpora for statistical machine translation and the limitations of comparable corpora for parallel sentence identification.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Europarl Corpus**: A parallel corpus for French-English language pair.
2. **BUCC2017 Task Data**: A comparable corpus for French-English language pair, containing monolingual corpora split into sentences.
3. **Gold Standard List**: A list of tab-separated EN-FR sentence_id pairs for the test data.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Europarl Corpus**, the citation is:
  > http://www.statmt.org/europarl/

- For **BUCC2017 Task Data**, the citation is:
  > https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2017/bucc2017-task.html

- For **Gold Standard List**, the citation is:
  > https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2017/bucc2017-task.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
