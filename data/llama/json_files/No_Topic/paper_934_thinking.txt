To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The beneit of syntactic vs. linear n-grams for linguistic descriptionMelanie Andresen and Heike ZinsmeisterUniversitA at HamburgInstitute for German Language and LiteratureGermany{melanie.andresen, heike.zinsmeister}@uni-hamburg.deAbstractAutomatic dependency annotations havebeen used in all kinds of language appli-cations. However, there has been muchless exploitation of dependency annota-tions for the linguistic description of lan-guage varieties. This paper presents an at-tempt to employ dependency annotationsfor describing style. We argue that forthis purpose, linear n-grams (that followthe textas surface) alone do not appropri-ately represent a language like German.For this claim, we present theoreticallyas well as empirically founded arguments.We suggest syntactic n-grams (that fol-low the dependency paths) as a possiblesolution. To demonstrate their potential,we compare the German academic lan-guages of linguistics and literary studiesusing both linear and syntactic n-grams.The results show that the approach usingsyntactic n-grams allows for the detectionof linguistically meaningful patterns thatdo not emerge in a linear n-gram analy-sis, e. g. complex verbs and light verb con-structions.1IntroductionLinear n-grams in the sense of adjacent stringsof tokens, parts of speech, etc. are a very com-mon and successful way of modeling languagein computational linguistics. However, linguis-tic structures do not always work in such linearways. From a cross-linguistic perspective, somelanguages are less linearly organized than others.While many (though not all) syntactic structures inEnglish can indeed be described by linear patterns,this is much less true for languages with a moreiexible word order and other syntactic propertiesthat induce long distance relations, e. g. German.Still, the linear n-gram approach is quite success-ful when used for applications in such languages.In the present paper our aim is a slightly differentone. We want to employ n-grams not as a meansfor an application but for linguistic description it-self. This requires the language modeling to bemore linguistically adequate and interpretable andnot just to be a means to an end. We consider theuse of syntactic n-grams in addition to linear onesto be a possibility to achieve this aim.In order to motivate our approach, we will irstintroduce the concept of syntactic n-grams (sec-tion 2) and present related work (section 3). Thenwe will investigate the descriptive beneit of syn-tactic n-grams by, irstly, looking at theoreticaldescriptions of non-linear German syntax (sec-tion 4.1), and secondly, by investigating empiri-cal consequences of such structures by describ-ing cross-linguistic differences in Universal De-pendencies (UD) treebanks, with a special focuson the comparison of English and German (sec-tion 4.2).In the main part of this paper we will presenta study of stylistic comparison between differentacademic disciplines, namely between linguisticsand literary studies in German (section 5). To cap-ture these differences, we will compare the fre-quencies of n-grams between the two disciplinesand contrast the results yielded by linear and syn-tactic n-grams in section 6.Finally, we will summarize our results in sec-tion 7. The analyses show that syntactic n-grams
