To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Multi-Object Tracking via Robust Collaborative Model and Sample Selection" by Mohamed A. Naiela, M. Omair Ahmad, M.N.S. Swamy, Jongwoo Lim, and Ming-Hsuan Yang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed scheme on seven challenging sequences, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of online multi-object tracking methods and the importance of robust collaborative models and sample selection schemes.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **PETS09-S2L1**: A sequence consisting of 799 frames of 768 A576 pixels recorded at 7 frames per second with medium crowd density.
2. **PETS09-S2L2**: A sequence consisting of 442 frames with the same resolution and frame rate as the PETS09-S2L1 sequence, but it contains heavy crowd density and illumination changes.
3. **UCF-PL**: A sequence consisting of 998 frames of 1920 A 1080 pixels recorded at 29 frames per second with medium crowd density, long-term occlusion, and targets of similar appearance.
4. **Soccer**: A sequence consisting of 155 frames of 960 A 544 pixels recorded at 3 to 5 frames per second.
5. **Town Center**: A sequence consisting of 4500 frames of 1080 A1920 pixels recorded at 25 frames per second.
6. **LISA10 Urban**: A sequence consisting of 300 frames of 704 A 480 pixels collected at 30 frames per second from a camera mounted on a moving vehicle.
7. **LISA10 Sunny**: A sequence consisting of 300 frames of 704 A 480 pixels collected at 30 frames per second from a highway with medium traffic density on a sunny day.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the proposed scheme.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PETS09-S2L1**, the citation is:
  > J. Ferryman, in: Proc. IEEE Workshop Performance Evaluation of Track-ing and Surveillance, 2009.

- For **PETS09-S2L2**, the citation is:
  > J. Ferryman, in: Proc. IEEE Workshop Performance Evaluation of Track-ing and Surveillance, 2009.

- For **UCF-PL**, the citation is:

- For **Soccer**, the citation is:
  > Y. Wu, X. Tong, Y. Zhang, H. Lu, Boosted interactively distributed particle ilter for automatic multi-object tracking, in: Proc. Int. Conf. on ImageProcess., 2008, pp. 1844a1847.

- For **Town Center**, the citation is:
  > B. Benfold, I. Reid, Stable multi-target tracking in real-time surveillancevideo, in: Proc. Comput. Vis. Pattern Recognit., 2011, pp. 3457a3464.

- For **LISA10 Urban**, the citation is:
  > S. Sivaraman, M. Trivedi, A general active-learning framework for on-road vehicle recognition and tracking, IEEE Trans. on Intell. Transp. Syst.11 (2) (2010) 267a276.

- For **LISA10 Sunny**, the citation is:
  > S. Sivaraman, M. Trivedi, A general active-learning framework for on-road vehicle recognition and tracking, IEEE Trans. on Intell. Transp. Syst.11 (2) (2010) 267a276.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
