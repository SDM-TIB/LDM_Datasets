To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Eficient Inference on Deep Neural Networks by Dynamic Representations and Decision Gates" by Mohammad Saeed Shaiee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of deep neural networks on the CIFAR10 dataset, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of deep neural networks and the importance of reducing computational cost, which hints at the evaluation of these models on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the CIFAR10 dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the CIFAR10 dataset was used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR10 dataset:

- For CIFAR10, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., & Hinton, G. E. (2012). ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) (pp. 1097-1105).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
