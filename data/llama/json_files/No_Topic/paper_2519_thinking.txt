To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Large Rated Lexicon with French Medical Words" by Natalia Grabar and Thierry Hamon, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the building of a lexicon with French medical words, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of assessing the readability of medical texts and the need for a lexicon to rate medical words.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Snomed International**: A medical terminology dataset in French.
2. **TreeTagger**: A part-of-speech tagging dataset.
3. **Flemm**: A lemmatization dataset.
4. **ASIP SANTE**: A medical terminology dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for annotation and evaluation of the lexicon.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Snomed International**, the citation is:
  > CEotA e, R., (1996). RA epertoire daanatomopathologie de laSNOMED internationale, v3.4. UniversitA e de Sher-brooke, Sherbrooke, QuA ebec.

- For **TreeTagger**, the citation is:
  > Schmid, H. (1994). Probabilistic part-of-speech taggingIn International Conference onusing decision trees.New Methods in Language Processing, pages 44a49.

- For **Flemm**, the citation is:
  > Namer, F. (2000). FLEMM : un analyseur iexionnel dufrancA ais `a base de r`egles. Traitement automatique deslangues (TAL), 41(2):523a547.

- For **ASIP SANTE**, the citation is:
  > (no specific citation found)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
