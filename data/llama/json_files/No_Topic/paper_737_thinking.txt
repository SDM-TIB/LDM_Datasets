To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta-learning with Minimax-Meta Regularization" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of meta-learning algorithms, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the generalization problem of meta-learning and the need for a regularization mechanism to address it. They hint at the evaluation of meta-learning algorithms on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Mini-Imagenet**: A dataset used for few-shot learning tasks.
2. **Omniglot**: A dataset used for few-shot learning tasks.
3. **Sinusoids**: A dataset used for few-shot regression tasks.
4. **MNIST**: A dataset used for robust reweighting tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their meta-learning algorithms, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Mini-Imagenet**, the citation is:
  > Ravi and Larochelle (2017)

- For **Omniglot**, the citation is:
  > Lake et al. (2015)

- For **Sinusoids**, the citation is:
  > Yin et al. (2019)

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > LeCun et al. (1998)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
