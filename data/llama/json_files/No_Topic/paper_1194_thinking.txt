To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Permutation-invariant Semantic Parsing in PERIN" by David Samuel and Milan Straka, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the Cross-Framework Meaning Representation Parsing (MRP) task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the MRP task and the need for a permutation-invariant approach to semantic parsing. They mention that the task involves parsing sentences into graph-structured meaning representations.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **AMR**: Abstract Meaning Representation
2. **DRG**: Discourse Representation Graphs
3. **EDS**: Elementary Dependency Structures
4. **PTG**: Prague Tectogrammatical Graphs
5. **UCCA**: Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation
6. **HUJI-KU**: A dataset for semantic parsing
7. **Hitachi**: A dataset for semantic parsing
8. **HIT-SCIR**: A dataset for semantic parsing
9. **CHEMDNER**: A dataset for semantic parsing
10. **Litte Prince**: A dataset for semantic parsing

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **AMR**, the citation is:
  > Banarescu et al. (2013) Abstract Meaning Representation for Sembanking.

- For **DRG**, the citation is:
  > Abzianidze et al. (2017) The Parallel Meaning Bank: Towards a Multilingual Corpus of Translations Annotated with Compositional In Proceedings of the Meaning Representations.

- For **EDS**, the citation is:
  > Oepen and LA nning (2006) Discriminant-Based MRS Banking.

- For **PTG**, the citation is:
  > Hajic et al. (2012) An-nouncing Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0.

- For **UCCA**, the citation is:
  > Abend and Rappoport (2013) Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA).

- For **HUJI-KU**, the citation is:
  > Arviv et al. (2020) HUJI-KU at MRP 2020: Two Transition-based Neural Parsers.

- For **Hitachi**, the citation is:
  > Ozaki et al. (2020) Hitachi at MRP 2020: Text-to-Graph-Notation Transducer.

- For **HIT-SCIR**, the citation is:
  > Dou et al. (2020) HIT-SCIR at MRP 2020: Transition-Based Parser and Iterative Inference Parser.

- For **CHEMDNER**, the citation is:
  > Krallinger et al. (2015) CHEMDNER: The drugs and chemical names extraction challenge.

- For **Litte Prince**, the citation is:
  > Oepen et al. (2019) MRP 2019: Cross-Framework Meaning Representation Parsing.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
