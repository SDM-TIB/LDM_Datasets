To extract datasets from the research paper titled "POS Tagging For Resource Poor Indian Languages Through Feature Projection" by 50S Bandyopadhyay, D S Sharma and R Sangal, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of parallel corpora for feature projection, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of supervised learning techniques for POS tagging in Indian languages and the need for creating annotated corpora for resource poor languages.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **ILCI (Indian Languages Corpora Initative) parallel corpora**: This dataset is used for feature projection and evaluation of POS tagging models.
2. **Hindi Treebank**: This dataset is used to create annotated corpora for Hindi and is also used for feature projection.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of POS tagging models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ILCI**, the citation is:
  > Choudhary and Jha. 2014. Creating multilingual parallel corpora in Indian languages. In Human Language Technology Challenges for Computer Science and Linguistics, pages 527-537. Springer.

- For **Hindi Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Bharati et al. 2006. Anncorra: Annotating corpora guidelines for pos and chunk annotation for Indian languages. LTRC-TR31.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
