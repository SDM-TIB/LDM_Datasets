To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Correlational Gaussian Processes for Cross-domain Visual Recognition" by Chengjiang Long and Gang Hua, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the visual recognition task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous models and the importance of cross-domain visual recognition. They hint at the evaluation of their model on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SUN 09 dataset**: A large-scale dataset containing 12,000 annotated images covering a wide range of scenes.
2. **E-Album dataset**: A dataset containing 108 photos taken at 21 locations in 19 events.
3. **G-Album dataset**: A dataset containing 312 photos taken at 141 locations in 117 events.
4. **VP dataset**: A dataset containing 1124 images of 8 politicians.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their model, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SUN 09 dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. He et al. *SUN dataset: A large-scale scene recognition benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1994–2003, 2012. https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2012.6169

- For **E-Album dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Cui et al. *Easyalbum: an interactive photo annotation system*. In Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGCHI International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology (ACE), pages 1–8, 2007. https://doi.org/10.1145/1284734.1284736

- For **G-Album dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Gallagher. *Clothing cosegmentation for recognizing people*. In Proceedings of the 2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1–8, 2008. https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2008.4509264

- For **VP dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Joo et al. *Visual persuasion: Inferring communicative intents of images*. In Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1–8, 2014. https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2014.69

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
