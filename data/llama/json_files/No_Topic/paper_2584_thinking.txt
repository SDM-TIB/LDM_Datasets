To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging SE(3) Equivariance for Self-Supervised Category-Level Object Pose Estimation" by Xiaolong Li, Yijia Weng, Li Yi, Leonidas J. Guibas, A. Lynn Abbott, and Shuran Song, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the ModelNet40 and NOCS-REAL275 datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the ModelNet40 and NOCS-REAL275 datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **ModelNet40**: A dataset of 3D models of 30 object categories.
2. **NOCS-REAL275**: A dataset of real-world depth point clouds.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Shuran Song, et al. *3D Shape Networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 3459–3468, 2016.

- For **NOCS-REAL275**, the citation is:
  > He Wang, et al. *Normalized Object Coordinate Space for category-level 6D object pose and size estimation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 2642–2651, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
