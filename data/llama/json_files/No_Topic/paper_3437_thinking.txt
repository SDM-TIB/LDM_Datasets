To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Figurative Language in Swedish Clinical Texts" by Dimitrios Kokkinakis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of clinical data, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of accounting for figurative language in clinical texts, but no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for analysis. Here, the authors mention the use of a large list of available idiomatic expressions (idioms and metaphors) extracted from various monolingual lexical resources for written Swedish, roughly 6,000 idiomatic expressions, as well as from several Internet sites.

In the **results section**, the authors mention the use of a list of string matching patterns, essentially rules, manually developed particularly for similes, and the extracted list of idiomatic expressions is modeled as a finite state recognizer which permits a controlled form of lexical and syntactic variability.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the list of idiomatic expressions, the citation is not explicitly mentioned, but it is likely based on the lexical resources used.

- For the list of string matching patterns, the citation is not explicitly mentioned, but it is likely based on the authors' own work.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
