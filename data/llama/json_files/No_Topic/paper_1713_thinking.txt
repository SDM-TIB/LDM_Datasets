To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interoperability of cross-lingual and cross-document event detection" by Piek Vossen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the system on a Wikinews corpus of 120 English articles that have been manually translated to Spanish and Dutch.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of event extraction across documents and languages, and the need for a semantically interoperable approach.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Wikinews corpus**: A corpus of 120 English articles that have been manually translated to Spanish and Dutch.
2. **DBpedia**: A knowledge graph that provides a standardized way of representing information in RDF.
3. **FrameNet**: A lexical database that provides a standardized way of representing word senses and their relationships.
4. **WordNet**: A lexical database that provides a standardized way of representing word senses and their relationships.
5. **OntoNotes**: A dataset of annotated text that provides a standardized way of representing entities, events, and their relationships.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their system.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Wikinews corpus**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.
- For **DBpedia**, the citation is:
  > Christian Chiarcos, Sebastian Nordhoff, and Sebastian Hellmann. Linked Data in Linguistics. Representing and Connecting Language Data and Language Metadata. Springer, Heidelberg.
- For **FrameNet**, the citation is:
  > Cosmin Adrian Bejan and Sanda Harabagiu. Un-supervised event coreference resolution with rich linguistic features. In Proceedings of the ACLa2010, Up-psala, Sweden.
- For **WordNet**, the citation is:
  > Christian Chiarcos. An ontology of linguistic annotations. LDV Forum, 23(1):1a16.
- For **OntoNotes**, the citation is:
  > Sameer Pradhan, Eduard Hovy, Mitchell Marcus, Martha Palmer, Lance Ramshaw, and Ralph Weischedel. Ontonotes: A unified relational semantic representation. International Journal of Semantic Computing, 1(4):405a419.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
