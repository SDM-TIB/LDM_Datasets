To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can the Transformer Learn Nested Recursion with Symbol Masking?" by Jean-Philippe Bernardy, Adam Ek, and Vladislav Maraev, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the language Dn as the set of strings generated by the context-free rules.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the language Dn and its characteristics, including the distance between a closing parenthesis and the corresponding opening parenthesis, and the amount of nesting between closing and opening parentheses.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the language Dn, which is used to generate strings with nested parentheses.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the experiments and results, including the accuracy of the model on the language Dn.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the language Dn:

- For the language Dn, the citation is not explicitly mentioned, but it is described as a set of strings generated by the context-free rules E ::= I; E ::= EE; E ::= oEc, where (o, c) stands for a pair of matching parenthesis pairs.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their descriptions from the paper.
