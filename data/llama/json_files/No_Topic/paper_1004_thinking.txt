To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inducing Latent Semantic Relations for Structured Distributional Semantics" by Sujay Kumar Jauhar and Eduard Hovy, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed model on two semantic tasks and a relation classification task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of standard distributional semantic models and the importance of structuring semantic space with relational information. They hint at the use of various datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **WS-353 dataset**: A dataset used for similarity scoring task.
2. **ESL dataset**: A dataset used for synonym selection task.
3. **SemEval-2012 task 2 dataset**: A dataset used for relation classification task.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their model, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WS-353 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Finkelstein et al. (2002) WS-353: WordNet-based semantic similarity measurement for word pairs.
- For **ESL dataset**, the citation is:
  > Turney (2002) Mining the web for synonyms: Pmi-ir versus lsa on toei.
- For **SemEval-2012 task 2 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jurgens et al. (2012) Semeval-2012 task 2: Measuring degrees of relational similarity.
