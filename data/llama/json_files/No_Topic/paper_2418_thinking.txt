To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Handling and Mining Linguistic Variation in UGC(invited talk)Leon DerczynskiDepartment of Computer ScienceThe University of Shefieldleon@dcs.shef.ac.uk1 Abstract2 BiographyAcross its many forms, user-generated content(UGC) acts as a sample of all human discourse.It has been harder to process this type of text withtraditional tools. People have even looked at nor-malising this text to look like the data that tradi-tional tools are used to. This talk examines thekind of variation we see in user-generated content,and contrary to the trend of normalisation, not onlypresents methods for coping with the noise with-out changing it, but also goes on to explain themany kinds of latent information expressed by thestable, consistent linguistic variation seen acrosssociety and the internet.Dr. Leon Derczynski is a Research Associate inthe University of Shefieldas NLP group. He hasworked on the forefront of social media languageprocessing since 2012, developing and releasingtools to the community and in GATE, and is apply-ing this by current work on multiple EU projectscentred around detecting and predicting rumoursand false claims on the web.
