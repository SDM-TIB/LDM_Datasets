To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On nature and causes of observed MT errors" by Maja PopoviA c, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the analysis of nature and causes of MT errors observed by different evaluators.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the evaluation of MT systems and the importance of human evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two publicly available data sets:

1. **DCU dataset**: This dataset was created for purposes of MT evaluation.
2. **HU dataset**: This dataset was created for improving an NMT system by giving it feedback about errors.

In the **results section**, the authors report results for three language pairs, two domains, and eleven MT systems.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DCU dataset**, the citation is:
  > PopoviA c, M. (2020a). Informative manual evaluation of machine translation output. In Proceedings of the28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 20), Online.

- For **HU dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kreutzer, J., Bastings, J., and Riezler, S. (2020). Correct Me If You Can: Learning from Error Correctionsand Markings. Proceedings of the 22nd Annual Conference of the European Association for MachineTranslation (EAMT 20).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
