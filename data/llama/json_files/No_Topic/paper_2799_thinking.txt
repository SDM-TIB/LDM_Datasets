To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparing Data Sources and Architectures for Deep Visual Representation Learning in Semantics" by Douwe Kiela, Anita L. VerEo and Stephen Clark, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the comparison of deep visual representation learning techniques and data sources, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional semantic models and the importance of multi-modal representation learning. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: A large image dataset used for training and evaluation of deep visual representation learning models.
2. **ESP Game**: A dataset of images annotated with words, used for evaluation of visual representation learning models.
3. **Google Images**: A dataset of images retrieved from Google search, used for evaluation of visual representation learning models.
4. **Bing Images**: A dataset of images retrieved from Bing search, used for evaluation of visual representation learning models.
5. **Flickr**: A dataset of images retrieved from Flickr, used for evaluation of visual representation learning models.
6. **MEN**: A dataset of human similarity and relatedness judgments, used for evaluation of visual representation learning models.
7. **SimLex-999**: A dataset of human similarity and relatedness judgments, used for evaluation of visual representation learning models.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Fei-Fei Li. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of CVPR, pages 248a255, 2009.

- For **ESP Game**, the citation is:
  > Luis von Ahn and Laura Dabbish. *Labeling images with a computer game*. In CHI, pages 319a326, 2004.

- For **Google Images**, the citation is:
  > Robert Fergus, Fei-Fei Li, Pietro Perona, and Andrew Zisserman. *Learning object categories from image search results*. In Proceedings of ICCV, pages 1816a1823, 2005.

- For **Bing Images**, the citation is:
  > Robert Fergus, Fei-Fei Li, Pietro Perona, and Andrew Zisserman. *Learning object categories from image search results*. In Proceedings of ICCV, pages 1816a1823, 2005.

- For **Flickr**, the citation is:
  > Robert Fergus, Fei-Fei Li, Pietro Perona, and Andrew Zisserman. *Learning object categories from image search results*. In Proceedings of ICCV, pages 1816a1823, 2005.

- For **MEN**, the citation is:
  > Bruni et al. (2012) *Multimodal distributional semantics*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 49:1a47.

- For **SimLex-999**, the citation is:
  > Hill et al. (2015) *Simlex-999: Evaluating semantic models with (gen-uine) similarity estimation*. Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
