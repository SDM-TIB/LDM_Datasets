To extract datasets from the research paper titled "More is not Necessary Better: Multilingual Auxiliary Tasks for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer of Hate Speech Detection" by Anonymous ACL submission, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of several datasets for hate speech detection, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer learning for hate speech detection and highlight the cultural gap between languages.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Hate speech datasets**: The authors mention that they use the same hate speech datasets as Nozza (2021), which are in three languages: English, Spanish, and Italian. Each language is divided into corpora from two domains: hate speech towards immigrants and hate speech towards women.
2. **Twitter datasets**: The authors mention Twitter datasets for sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and syntactic tasks.
3. **Universal Dependencies (UD) datasets**: The authors mention UD datasets for syntactic tasks.
4. **WNUT 2016 NER shared task dataset**: The authors mention this dataset for named entity recognition.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Hate speech datasets**, the citation is:
  > Nozza (2021) uses the same hate speech datasets as this paper.

- For **Twitter datasets**, the citation is:
  > Barbieri et al. (2016) and Rosenthal et al. (2017) provide sentiment analysis datasets on Twitter.

- For **Universal Dependencies (UD) datasets**, the citation is:
  > Nivre et al. (2020) provide UD datasets for syntactic tasks.

- For **WNUT 2016 NER shared task dataset**, the citation is:
  > Strauss et al. (2016) provide this dataset for named entity recognition.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
