To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 340a345, Soia, Bulgaria, August 4-9 2013. c2013 Association for Computational Linguistics" by Lei Cuia, Dongdong Zhanga, Shujie Liua, Mu Lia, and Ming Zhouaa School of Computer Science and TechnologyHarbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the importance of bilingual data quality in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of supervised learning methods for bilingual data cleaning and the need for an unsupervised approach.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **NIST 2003 (dev)**
2. **NIST 2005 (test)**
3. **NIST 2006 (test)**
4. **NIST 2008 (test)**
5. **CWMT 2008 (test)**
6. **In-house dataset 1 (test)**
7. **In-house dataset 2 (test)**
8. **In-house dataset 3 (test)**
9. **United Nations parallel corpus released by LDC**
10. **Parallel corpus released by China Workshop on Machine Translation (CWMT)**

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **NIST 2003 (dev)**, the citation is:
  > Jiang et al., 2009

- For **NIST 2005 (test)**, the citation is:
  > Jiang et al., 2009

- For **NIST 2006 (test)**, the citation is:
  > Jiang et al., 2009

- For **NIST 2008 (test)**, the citation is:
  > Jiang et al., 2009

- For **CWMT 2008 (test)**, the citation is:
  > Jiang et al., 2009

- For **In-house dataset 1 (test)**, the citation is:
  > Jiang et al., 2009

- For **In-house dataset 2 (test)**, the citation is:
  > Jiang et al., 2009

- For **In-house dataset 3 (test)**, the citation is:
  > Jiang et al., 2009

- For **United Nations parallel corpus released by LDC**, the citation is:
  > Jiang et al., 2009

- For **Parallel corpus released by China Workshop on Machine Translation (CWMT)**, the citation is:
  > Jiang et al., 2009

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
