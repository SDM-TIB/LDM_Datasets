To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning from Group Comparisons: Exploiting Higher Order Interactions" by Yao Li, Minhao Cheng, Kevin Fujii, and Fushing Hsieh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of online game datasets for evaluating the proposed model, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the problem of learning from group comparisons and the limitations of previous approaches, which implies that datasets are used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two online game datasets:

1. **Heroes of the Storm (HotS) tournament data**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed model on tournament games.
2. **Dota 2 data**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed model on Dota 2 games.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **HotS tournament data**, the citation is:
  > [32]

- For **Dota 2 data**, the citation is:
  > [33]

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
