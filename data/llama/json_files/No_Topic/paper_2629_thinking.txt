To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reducing infrequent-token perplexity via variational corpora" by Yusheng Xie, Pranjal Daga, Yu Cheng, Kunpeng Zhang, and Ankit Agrawal, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the Brown corpus and the Brown corpus's vocabulary.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the Brown corpus and its vocabulary, which suggests that the Brown corpus is a dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the Brown corpus.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the Brown corpus was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Brown corpus:

- For the Brown corpus, the citation is:
  > Nelson Francis and Henry Kucera. 1979. Brown corpus manual. Technical report, Department of Linguistics, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, US.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
