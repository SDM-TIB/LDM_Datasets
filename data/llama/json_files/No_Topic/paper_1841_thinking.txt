To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lingua: Addressing Scenarios for LiveInterpretation and Automatic Dubbing" by Nathan J. Anderson, Caleb Wilson, and Stephen D. Richardson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the development and pilot of the Lingua system, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of cascaded STS systems and the potential of Lingua to address these limitations. They hint at the use of customized ASR and MT components, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Customized ASR dataset**: This dataset is used for training the customized ASR component.
2. **Customized MT dataset**: This dataset is used for training the customized MT component.
3. **TTS dataset**: This dataset is used for training the TTS component.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of the Lingua system, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Customized ASR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Customized MT dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **TTS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not found

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
