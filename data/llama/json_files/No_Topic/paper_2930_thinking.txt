To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MaCoCu: Massive collection and curation of monolingual and bilingual data: focus on under-resourced languages" by Marta Ba EnA ona et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the project MaCoCu and its goal of building monolingual and parallel corpora for under-resourced languages.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the project's objectives and the approach followed, which includes crawling large amounts of textual data from selected top-level domains of the Internet and applying a curation and enrichment pipeline.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for the project. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MaCoCu dataset**: This dataset is the main focus of the project, containing monolingual and parallel corpora for under-resourced languages.
2. **Paracrawl dataset**: This dataset is used as a reference for the MaCoCu project, containing parallel corpora for several languages.
3. **Oscar dataset**: This dataset is also used as a reference for the MaCoCu project, containing parallel corpora for several languages.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for the project, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MaCoCu dataset**, the citation is:

Forcada, Cristian GarcA Aa-Romeroa, Taja Kuzmana, Nikola LjubeEsiA ca, Rik van Noorda, Leopoldo Pla Semperea, Gema RamA Arez-SA ancheza, Peter Rupnika, VA At Suchomela, Antonio Torala, Tobias van der Werffa, Jaume Zaragoza. *MaCoCu: Massive collection and curation of monolingual and bilingual data: focus on under-resourced languages*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 4555a4567, Online, July.

- For **Paracrawl dataset**, the citation is:

Forcada, Amir Kamran, Faheem Kirefu, Philipp Koehn, Sergio Ortiz Rojas, Leopoldo Pla Sem-pere, Gema RamA Arez-SA anchez, Elsa SarrA Aas, MarekStrelec, Brian Thompson, William Waites, Dion Wig-gins, and Jaume Zaragoza. *ParaCrawl: Web-scale acquisition of parallel corpora*.

- For **Oscar dataset**, the citation is:
  > Julien Abadji, Pedro Ortiz Suarez, Laurent Romary, and BenoEAt Sagot. *Towards a Cleaner Document-Oriented Multilingual Crawled Corpus*. arXiv e-prints, page arXiv:2201.06642, January.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
