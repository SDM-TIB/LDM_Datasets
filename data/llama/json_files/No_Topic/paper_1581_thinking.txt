To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Object-Oriented Representation for Eficient Reinforcement Learning" by Carlos Diuk, Andre Cohen, and Michael L. Littman, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the Taxi domain and the Pitfall videogame, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of standard Markov Decision Process (MDP) formalization and the introduction of Object-Oriented MDPs (OO-MDPs).

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Taxi domain**: A grid-based domain with 500 states.
2. **Pitfall videogame**: A real-life videogame with a large state space.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Taxi domain**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.
- For **Pitfall videogame**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
