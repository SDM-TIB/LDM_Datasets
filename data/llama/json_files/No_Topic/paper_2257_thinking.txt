To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Small-Variance Asymptotics for Hidden Markov Models" by Anirban Roychowdhury, Ke Jiang, and Brian Kulis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the Hidden Markov Model, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing algorithms for the Hidden Markov Model and the importance of developing scalable algorithms. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Synthetic Gaussian hidden Markov model data**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the proposed algorithm.
2. **Financial time-series prediction data**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the proposed algorithm.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Synthetic Gaussian hidden Markov model data**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Financial time-series prediction data**, the citation is:
  > Not found

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
