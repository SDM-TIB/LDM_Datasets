To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SOPA: Random Forests Regression for the Semantic Textual Similarity task" by Davide Buscaldi, Jorge J. GarcA Aa Flores, Ivan V. Meza, and Isaac RodrA Aguez, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various datasets for the Semantic Textual Similarity task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the technical problems that affected their previous participation and the inclusion of additional features based on alignments.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **AQUAINT-2**: A dataset used for the English sub-task.
2. **NTCIR-84**: A dataset used for the English sub-task.
3. **DBPedia**: A dataset used for the English sub-task.
4. **UkWaC**: A dataset used for the English sub-task.
5. **RAE8**: A dictionary used for the Spanish sub-task.
6. **Spanish QA@CLEF 2005**: A dataset used for the Spanish sub-task.
7. **MultiUN**: A dataset used for the Spanish sub-task.
8. **Sultan similarity**: A dataset used for the alignment measure.
9. **WordNet**: A dataset used for the conceptual similarity measure.
10. **CMU Sphinx-4**: A dataset used for the speech recognition system.
11. **Yago**: A dataset used for the named entity recognition.
12. **Geo-WordNet**: A dataset used for the geographical context similarity measure.
13. **Google Web 1T**: A dataset used for the information retrieval-based similarity measure.
14. **Clustered Keywords Positional Distance (CKPD)**: A dataset used for the n-gram based similarity measure.
15. **British National Corpus**: A dataset used for the information retrieval-based similarity measure.
16. **Google Web 1T**: A dataset used for the n-gram based similarity measure.
17. **Google Web 1T**: A dataset used for the n-gram based similarity measure.
18. **Google Web 1T**: A dataset used for the n-gram based similarity measure.
19. **Google Web 1T**: A dataset used for the n-gram based similarity measure.
20. **Google Web 1T**: A dataset used for the n-gram based similarity measure.
