To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Energy Disaggregation via DiscriminativeSparse Coding" by J. Zico Kolter, Siddarth Batra, and Andrew Y. Ng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the energy disaggregation task and the use of a large-scale energy disaggregation task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of energy disaggregation and the limitations of current electricity meters. They also mention the Plugwise energy data set.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the Plugwise energy data set.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the Plugwise energy data set was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Plugwise energy data set:

- For the Plugwise energy data set, the citation is:
  > Plugwise. (n.d.). Plugwise Energy Data Set. Retrieved from <https://www.plugwise.com/en/data>

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
