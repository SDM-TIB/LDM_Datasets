To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cluster Labeling by Word Embeddings and WordNet as Hypernymy" by Hanieh Poostchi and Massimo Piccardi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the biomedical domain, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of word2vec and the importance of character-based representations like fastText. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named entity recognition corpora:

1. **WebAP dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the proposed approach.
2. **RAKE dataset**: This dataset is used for keyword extraction.
3. **GloVe dataset**: This dataset is used for word embeddings.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WebAP dataset**, the citation is:
  > Keikha et al. (2014) Retrieving Passages and Finding Answers. In Proceedings of the 2014 Australasian DocumentComputing Symposium (ADCS). pages 81a84.

- For **RAKE dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rose et al. (2010). Automatic Keyword Extraction from Individ-In Text Mining. Applications andual Documents.Theory, Wiley-Blackwell, chapter 1, pages 1a20.

- For **GloVe dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mikolov et al. (2013). GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation. In Proceedings of the 2014 Empirical Methods in Nat-ural Language Processing (EMNLP). volume 14, pages 1532a1543.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
