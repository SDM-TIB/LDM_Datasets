To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Self-Training through Spaced Repetition" by Hadi Amiri, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of IMDb and Twitter datasets for sentiment classification and churn prediction tasks.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of current self-training methods and the importance of exploring the entire data space.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **IMDb dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification tasks.
2. **Churn dataset**: This dataset is used for churn prediction tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **IMDb dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maas et al. (2011) for sentiment classification where systems should classify the polarity of a given movie review as positive or negative.

- For **Churn dataset**, the citation is:
  > Amiri and Daum A e III (2015) for churn prediction tasks.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
