To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Evaluation of Multimodal Machine Translation" by Desmond Elliotta, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the biomedical domain, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of word2vec and the importance of character-based representations like fastText. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named entity recognition corpora:

1. **Multi30K dataset**: This dataset is used for multimodal machine translation tasks.
2.  **JNLPBA corpus**: This corpus annotates proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
3.  **CHEMDNER corpus**: This dataset is focused on annotating drugs and chemicals.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Multi30K dataset**, the citation is:
  > Desmond Elliott, Stella Frank, Lucia Specia. 2016. Multi30K: Multilingual English-German Image Descriptions. In Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Vision and Language, pages 70–74.

- For **JNLPBA**, the citation is:
  > Jin-Dong Kim, Tomoko Ohta, Yoshimasa Tsuruoka, Yuka Tateisi, and Nigel Collier. *Introduction to the bio-entity recognition task at JNLPBA*. In Proceedings of the 2004 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), pages 70–75, 2004.

- For **CHEMDNER**, the citation is:
  > Martin Krallinger, Florian Leitner, Obdulia Rabal, Miguel Vazquez, Julen Oyarzabal, and Alfonso Valencia. *CHEMDNER: The drugs and chemical names extraction challenge*. Journal of Cheminformatics, 7(Suppl 1):S1, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
