To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiway Attention Networks for Modeling Sentence Pairs" by Chuanqi Tany, Furu Wei, Wenhui Wang, Weifeng Lv, and Ming Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the Quora Question Pairs, SNLI, MultiNLI, and SQuAD datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the task of modeling sentence pairs and mention the Quora Question Pairs, SNLI, MultiNLI, and SQuAD datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Quora Question Pairs**: A dataset consisting of over 400,000 question pairs, each annotated with a binary value indicating whether the two questions are paraphrases of each other.
2. **SNLI**: A natural language inference dataset containing 570,152 sentence pairs, each labeled with one of the following relationships: entailment, contradiction, neutral.
3. **MultiNLI**: A natural language inference dataset containing 392,702 sentence pairs, each labeled with one of the following relationships: entailment, contradiction, neutral.
4. **SQuAD**: A reading comprehension dataset, where the answer to each question is a span of text from the corresponding passage.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Quora Question Pairs**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **SNLI**, the citation is:
  > Bowman et al., 2015

- For **MultiNLI**, the citation is:
  > Williams et al., 2017

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar et al., 2016

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
