To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SCAR: Sentence Compression using Autoencoders for Reconstruction" by Chanakya Malireddy, Tirth Maniar, and Manish Shrivastava, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of benchmark datasets for evaluation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing sentence compression methods and the need for unsupervised approaches. They hint at the use of benchmark datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Gigaword**: A benchmark dataset for sentence compression.
2. **DUC-2003**: A benchmark dataset for sentence compression.
3. **DUC-2004**: A benchmark dataset for sentence compression.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their model, SCAR.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Gigaword**, the citation is:
  > Alexander M. Rush, Sumit Chopra, and Jason Weston. *A neural attention model for abstractive sentence summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 379a389, Lisbon, Portugal. https://doi.org/10.3115/1612900

- For **DUC-2003**, the citation is:
  > Paul Over, Hoa Dang, and Donna Harman. *DUC-2003: Document Understanding Corpus*. Information Processing & Management, 43(6):1506a1520.

- For **DUC-2004**, the citation is:
  > Paul Over, Hoa Dang, and Donna Harman. *DUC-2004: Document Understanding Corpus*. Information Processing & Management, 43(6):1506a1520.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
