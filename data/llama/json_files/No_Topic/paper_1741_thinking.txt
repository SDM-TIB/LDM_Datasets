To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dr.Bokeh: DiffeRentiable Occlusion-aware Bokeh Rendering" by Yichen Sheng, Jianming Zhang, and others, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of rendering algorithms for the bokeh effect, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing bokeh rendering methods and the importance of occlusion-aware rendering. They hint at the evaluation of their method on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MPIB**: A dataset for bokeh rendering.
2. **BokehMe**: A dataset for bokeh rendering.
3. **SteReFo**: A dataset for bokeh rendering.
4. **DeepLens**: A dataset for bokeh rendering.
5. **Light Field Dataset**: A dataset for light field rendering.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their method, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MPIB**, the citation is:
  > Juewen Peng, Jianming Zhang, Xianrui Luo, Hao Lu, Ke Xian, and Zhiguo Cao. MPIB: An MPI-Based Bokeh Rendering Framework for Realistic Partial Occlusion Effects. In Computer Vision a ECCV 2022, pages 590a607, Cham, 2022. Springer Nature Switzerland.

- For **BokehMe**, the citation is:
  > Juewen Peng, Zhiguo Cao, Xianrui Luo, Hao Lu, Ke Xian, and Jianming Zhang. BokehMe: When Neural Rendering Meets Classical Rendering. In 2022 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 15674a15683, Nashville, TN, USA, 2022. IEEE.

- For **SteReFo**, the citation is:
  > Benjamin Busam, Matthieu Hog, Steven McDonagh, and Gregory Slabaugh. SteReFo: Efficient Image Refocusing with Stereo Vision. In 2019 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshop (ICCVW), pages 3295a3304, Seoul, Korea (South), 2019. IEEE.

- For **DeepLens**, the citation is:
  > Lijun Wang, Xiaohui Shen, Jianming Zhang, Oliver Wang, Zhe Lin, Chih-Yao Hsieh, Sarah Kong, and Huchuan Lu. DeepLens: Shallow Depth Of Field From A Single Image. arXiv:1810.08100 [cs], 2018. arXiv: 1810.08100.

- For **Light Field Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pratul P. Srinivasan, Rahul Garg, Neal Wadhwa, Ren Ng, and Jonathan T. Barron. Aperture Supervision for Monocular Depth Estimation. In 2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 6393a6401, Salt Lake City, UT, 2018. IEEE.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
