    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ARShadowGAN: Shadow Generative Adversarial Network for Augmented Reality in Single Light Scenes" by Daquan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

    First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the construction of a new dataset for training and evaluating the proposed ARShadowGAN.

    In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of generating virtual object shadows consistent with real-world environment shading effects in augmented reality applications.

    Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors mention the construction of a new dataset called Shadow-AR dataset.

    In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the Shadow-AR dataset was used for training and evaluating the proposed ARShadowGAN.

    Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Shadow-AR dataset:
