To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sampling via Controlled Stochastic Dynamical Systems" by Benjamin J. Zhang, Tuhin Sahai, and Youssef M. Marzouk, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the construction of controlled stochastic dynamical systems that exactly sample from a class of probability distributions with Gaussian tails.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the problem of computing expectations with respect to complex probability distributions and the need for efficient schemes for producing samples that approximate the distribution.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **1-D Gaussian mixture model**: A target distribution with two components, each with a Gaussian distribution.
2. **2-D distribution**: A slight modification of an example in [19]; an exact formula for the density is in the appendix.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **1-D Gaussian mixture model**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For the **2-D distribution**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
