To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MixedEmotions: Social Semantic Emotion Analysis for Innovative Multilingual Big Data Analytics Markets ICT-15-2014 Big data and Open Data Innovation and take-up - Innovation Action Industry Partners Expert System, Italy Millward Brown, Czech Republic Academic Partners Insight Centre for Data Analytics, National University of Ireland, Galway (coordinator) Paradigma TecnolA3gico, Spain Universidad PolitAcnica de Madrid, Spain Phonexia, Czech Republic University of Passau, Germany SindiceTech, Ireland Brno University of Technology, Czech Republic Deutsche Welle, Germany Project duration: April 2015 - March 2017 Summary Emotion analysis is central to tracking customer and user behaviour and satisfaction, which can be observed from user interaction in the form of explicit feedback through email, call centre interaction, social media comments, etc., as well as implicit acknowledgment of approval or rejection through facial expressions, speech or other non-verbal feedback. In Europe specifically, but increasingly also globally, an added factor here is that user feedback can be in multiple languages, in text as well as in speech and audio-visual content. This implies different cultural backgrounds and thus different ways to produce and perceive emotions in everyday interactions, beyond the fact of having specific rules for encoding and decoding emotions in each language. Making sense of accumulated user interaction from different (amixeda) data sources, modalities and languages is challenging and has not yet been explored in fullness in an industrial context. Commer-cial solutions exist but do not address the multilingual aspect in a robust and large-scale setting and do not scale up to huge data volumes that need to be processed, or the integration of emotion analysis observations across data sources and/or modalities on a meaningful level, i.e. keeping track of entities involved as well the connections between them (who said what? to whom? in the context of which event, product, service?) The MixedEmotions project will implement an integrated Big Linked Data platform for emotion analysis across heterogeneous data sources, languages and modalities, building on existing state-of-the-art tools, services and approaches that will enable the tracking of emotional aspects of user inter-action and feedback on an entity level. The platform will provide an integrated solution for: Large-scale emotion analysis and fusion on heterogeneous, multilingual, text, speech, video and social media data streams, leveraging open access and proprietary data sources, exploiting also social context by leveraging social network graphs Semantic-level emotion information aggregation and integration through robust extraction of so-cial semantic knowledge graphs for emotion analysis along multidimensional clusters The platform will be developed and evaluated in the context of three cross-domain pilot projects that are representative of a variety of data analytics markets: Social TV, Brand Reputation Man-agement, Call Centre Operations.
