To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BERT + Ensembling = Too Cool: Using MultipleBERT Models Together for Various COVID-19 Tweet Identification Tasks" by Leung Wai Liu, Akshat Gupta, Saheed O. Obitayo, Xiaomo Liu, and Sameena Shah, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the COVID-19 tweet identification tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of Twitter data and the importance of pharmacovigilance and health mandate related tasks. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **DeepADEMiner dataset**: This dataset is used for pharmacovigilance tasks.
2.  **stance detection dataset**: This dataset is used for health mandate related tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DeepADEMiner dataset**, the citation is:
  > Arjun Magge, Elena Tutubalina, Zulfat Miftahutdinov, Ilseyar Alimova, Anne Dirkson, Suzan Verberne, Davy Weissenbacher, and Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez. *DeepADEMiner: a deep learning pharmacovigilance pipeline for extraction and normalization of adverse drug event mentions on Twitter*. In Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, pages 2184â€“2192, 2021.

- For **stance detection dataset**, the citation is:
  > Vera Davydova and Elena Tutubalina. 2022. SMM4H2022 Task 2: Dataset for stance and premise detection in tweets about health mandates related to COVID-19. In Proceedings of the Seventh Social Media Mining for Health (#SMM4H) Workshop and Shared Task, pages a.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
