To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SemEval-2021 Task 8: MeasEval a Extracting Counts and Measurements and their Related Contexts" by Corey A Harper, Jessica Cox, Curt Kohler, Antony Scerri, Ron Daniel, Jr. and Paul Groth, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the MeasEval task and the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors describe the MeasEval task and its importance in extracting counts, measurements, and related contexts from scientific documents.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MeasEval dataset**: This dataset includes 110 CC-BY licensed articles that have been made previously available by Elsevier Labs.
2. **LITTERBASE**: This dataset aggregates observations of marine litter distribution.
3. **NeuroElectro**: This dataset collects information on electrophysiological properties of neurons.
4. **Zebraish Information Network**: This dataset provides summaries of gene information.
5. **CC-BY licensed articles**: This dataset includes 110 articles that have been made previously available by Elsevier Labs.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MeasEval dataset**, the citation is:
  > Corey A Harper, Jessica Cox, Curt Kohler, Antony Scerri, Ron Daniel, Jr. and Paul Groth. *MeasEval: A Shared Task for Extracting Counts, Measurements, and Related Contexts from Scientific Documents*. Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2021), pages 306-316.

- For **LITTERBASE**, the citation is:
  > Melanie Bergmann, Mine B Tekman, and L. Gutow. *LITTERBASE: An Online Portal for Marine Litter and Microplastics and Their Implications for Marine Life*. pages 106-107.

- For **NeuroElectro**, the citation is:
  > Shreejoy J. Tripathy, Judith Savitskaya, Shawn D. Bur-ton, Nathaniel N. Urban, and Richard C. Gerkin. *NeuroElectro: A window to the world as neu-ron electrophysiology data*. Frontiers in Neuroinformatics, 8(APR):1-19, 2014.

- For **Zebraish Information Network**, the citation is:
  > J. Sprague. *The Zebraish Information Network: the zebraish model organism database*. Nucleic Acids Research, 34(90001):D581-D585, 2006.

- For **CC-BY licensed articles**, the citation is:
  > Corey A Harper, Jessica Cox, Curt Kohler, Antony Scerri, Ron Daniel, Jr. and Paul Groth. *MeasEval: A Shared Task for Extracting Counts, Measurements, and Related Contexts from Scientific Documents*. Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2021), pages 306-316.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
