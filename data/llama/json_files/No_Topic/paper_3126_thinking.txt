To extract datasets from the research paper titled "55Syntax-based Rewriting for Simultaneous Machine Translation" by He He, Jordan Boyd-Graber, and Hal DaumA III, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for simultaneous machine translation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of conventional batch translation and the importance of reducing translation delay. They hint at the evaluation of their approach on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named datasets:

1. **Reuters Japanese-English corpus**: This dataset is used for simultaneous machine translation evaluation.
2. **Kyoto corpus**: This dataset is used for identifying quotative verbs.
3. **EIJIRO dictionary entries and accompanying example sentences**: This dataset is used for training the machine translation system.
4. **EIJIRO corpus**: This dataset is used for simultaneous machine translation evaluation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their approach, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Reuters Japanese-English corpus**, the citation is:
  > Utiyama and Isahara (2003)

- For **Kyoto corpus**, the citation is:
  > Neubig (2011)

- For **EIJIRO dictionary entries and accompanying example sentences**, the citation is:
  > EIJIRO dictionary entries and accompanying example sentences (no specific citation found)

- For **EIJIRO corpus**, the citation is:
  > EIJIRO corpus (no specific citation found)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
