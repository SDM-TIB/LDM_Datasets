    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Effective Spell Checking Methods Using Clustering Algorithms" by Renato Cordeiro de Amorim and Glynd Ewr University, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of an English misspelling list compiled using real examples extracted from the Birkbeck spelling error corpus.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of an English misspelling list compiled using real examples extracted from the Birkbeck spelling error corpus.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Birkbeck spelling error corpus**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the spell checking method.
2. **English dictionary**: This dataset is used as the dictionary for spell checking.
3. **Hunspell dictionary**: This dataset is used as a reference for Hunspell-based spell checking.
4. **Google Web IT 3-gram dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the spell checking method.
5. **British National Corpus (BNC)**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the spell checking method.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their method, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Birkbeck spelling error corpus**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **English dictionary**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Hunspell dictionary**, the citation is:
  > Pirinen and Linden (2010a)

- For **Google Web IT 3-gram dataset**, the citation is:
  > Islam and Inkpen (2009)

- For **British National Corpus (BNC)**, the citation is:
  > Not found

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
