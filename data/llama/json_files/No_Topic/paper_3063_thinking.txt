To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Saarland Vector-based Models of Semantic Textual Similarity" by Georgiana Dinu, Stefan Thater, and others, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of several datasets for the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of various vector space models for word meaning similarity, including the contextualization model of Thater et al. (2011), and mention the Microsoft Research Video Description dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Se-meval 2012 Sentence Textual Similarity task**: This dataset is used for the STS task.
2. **Microsoft Research Video Description dataset**: This dataset is used for the video description task.
3. **Microsoft Research Paraphrase dataset**: This dataset is used for the paraphrase task.
4. **Europarl dataset**: This dataset is used for the machine translation task.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Se-meval 2012 Sentence Textual Similarity task**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Microsoft Research Video Description dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Microsoft Research Paraphrase dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Europarl dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not found

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
