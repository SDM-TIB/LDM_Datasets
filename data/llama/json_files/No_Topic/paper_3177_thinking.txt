To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CAUSAL-TGAN: CAUSALLY-AWARE TABULAR DATAGENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of simulated and real-world datasets for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of incorporating causal relationships in tabular data generation.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Simulated datasets**: These datasets are used to evaluate the performance of Causal-TGAN under different expert knowledge conditions.
2. **Real-world datasets**: These datasets are used to evaluate the performance of Causal-TGAN on real-world tabular data.
