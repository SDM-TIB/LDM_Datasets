To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Latent Traversal with Semantic Constraints" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of two face datasets (FFHQ and CelebA-HQ) and the evaluation on two pre-trained GAN models: PGGAN and StyleGAN.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing approaches to control the generation of images through latent codes.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two face datasets:

1. **FFHQ**: A high-resolution face dataset.
2. **CelebA-HQ**: A high-resolution face dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their method.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **FFHQ**, the citation is:
  > Karras et al., 2017

- For **CelebA-HQ**, the citation is:
  > Karras et al., 2017

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
