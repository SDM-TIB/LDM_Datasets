To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporally-Informed Analysis of Named Entity Recognition" by Shruti Rijhwania and Daniel PreotA iuc-Pietro, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dataset for Twitter Named Entity Recognition, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets for named entity recognition and the importance of using temporally-diverse training data. They hint at the evaluation of their models on a new dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Broad Twitter Corpus**: This dataset is used for named entity recognition tasks.
2. **Temporal Twitter Corpus**: This dataset is introduced by the authors and is used for named entity recognition tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Broad Twitter Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Leon Derczynski, Kalina Bontcheva, and Ian Roberts. *Broad twitter corpus: A diverse named entity recognition resource*. In Proceedings of COLING 2016, pages 1169-1179, 2016.

- For **Temporal Twitter Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Shruti Rijhwania and Daniel PreotA iuc-Pietro. *Temporal Twitter Corpus: A Novel Dataset for Named Entity Recognition*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 7605-7617, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
