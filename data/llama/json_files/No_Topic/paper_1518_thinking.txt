    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "1722CANE: Context-Aware Network Embedding for Relation Modeling" by Chunchao Tu, Han Liu, Zhiyuan Liu, and Maosong Sun, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the context-aware network embedding, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing network embedding models and the importance of context-aware embeddings. They hint at the evaluation of their model on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three real-world datasets:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset.
2. **HepTh**: A high-energy physics theory dataset.
3. **Zhihu**: A question-and-answer dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their model, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Andrew McCallum, Kamal Nigam, Jason Rennie, and Kristie Seymore. *Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning*. Formation Retrieval Journal 3(127-163), 2000.

- For **HepTh**, the citation is:
  > Jure Leskovec, Jon Kleinberg, and Christos Faloutsos. *Graphs over time: densification laws, shrinkage, and rapid increase in nodes*. Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, pages 177-187, 2005.

- For **Zhihu**, the citation is:
  > https://www.zhihu.com/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
