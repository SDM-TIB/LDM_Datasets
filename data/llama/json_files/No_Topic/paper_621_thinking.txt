To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Noisy Correspondence Learning with Equivariant Similarity Consistency" by Yuchen Yang, Likai Wang, Erkun Yang, and Cheng Deng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the cross-modal matching task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of cross-modal matching and the need for high-quality labeled training data. They mention three widely used datasets:

1. **Flickr30K**: A large-scale image-text matching dataset.
2. **MS-COCO**: A large-scale object detection and image captioning dataset.
3. **Conceptual Captions**: A large-scale image captioning dataset with noisy correspondence.

In the **materials and methods section**, the authors mention that they use the three datasets for training and testing their model.

In the **results section**, the authors report the performance of their model on the three datasets.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Flickr30K**, the citation is:
  > Peter Young, Alice Lai, Micah Hodosh, and Julia Hockenmaier. *From image descriptions to visual denotations: Newsimilarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions*. Trans. Assoc. Comput. Linguist., 2:67a78, 2014.

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > TY Lin, M Maire, S Belongie, J Hays, P Perona, D Ramanan, P DollA ar, CL Zitnick, et al. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. 2014.

- For **Conceptual Captions**, the citation is:
  > Piyush Sharma, Nan Ding, Sebastian Goodman, and Radu Soricut. *Conceptual captions: A cleaned, hypernymed, image alt-text dataset for automatic image captioning*. In ACL, pages 2556a2565, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
