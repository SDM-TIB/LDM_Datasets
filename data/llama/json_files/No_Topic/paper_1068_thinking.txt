To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Near-Optimal Smoothing of Structured ConditionalProbability Matrices" by Moein Falahatgar, Mesrob I. Ohannessian, and Alon Orlitsky, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the biomedical domain, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of word2vec and the importance of character-based representations like fastText. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **tartuffe**: A French text, train and test size: 9.3k words, vocabulary size: 2.8k words.
2. **genesis**: English version, train and test size: 19k words, vocabulary size: 4.4k words.
3. **brown**: Shortened Brown corpus, train and test size: 20k words, vocabulary size: 10.5k words.
4. **a**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
5. **b**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
6. **c**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
7. **d**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
8. **e**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
9. **f**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
10. **g**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
11. **h**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
12. **i**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
13. **j**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
14. **k**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
15. **l**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
16. **m**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
17. **n**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
18. **o**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
19. **p**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
20. **q**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
21. **r**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
22. **s**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
23. **t**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
24. **u**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
25. **v**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
26. **w**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
27. **x**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
28. **y**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
29. **z**: A synthetic model determined randomly.
