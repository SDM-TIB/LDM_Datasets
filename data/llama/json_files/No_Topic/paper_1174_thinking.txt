To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Large-Scale Dataset for Empathetic Response Generation" by Anuradha Welivita, Yubo Xie and Pearl Pu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the development of a large-scale silver dataset for empathetic response generation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing empathetic datasets and the importance of creating a large-scale dataset for empathetic response generation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **EmpatheticDialogues**: A dataset containing 25K open-domain dialogues grounded on 32 emotions.
2. **IEMOCAP**: A dataset containing 151 dialogues annotated with 7 emotions.
3. **MELD**: A dataset containing 1,433 dialogues annotated with 7 emotions.
4. **DailyDialogue**: A dataset containing 12,218 dialogues annotated with 7 emotions.
5. **EmotionLines**: A dataset containing 14,503 dialogues annotated with 7 emotions.
6. **EmoContext**: A dataset containing 38,421 dialogues annotated with 9 emotions.
7. **EDOS**: A large-scale silver dataset containing 1M emotional dialogues from movie subtitles.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
