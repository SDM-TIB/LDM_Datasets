To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph-based Semi-Supervised Approach for Analysis of Derivational Nouns in Sanskrit" by Amrith Krishna, Pavankumar Satuluri, Shubham Sharma, Apurv Kumar, and Pawan Goyal, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the Sanskrit language, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing analyzers for Sanskrit and the importance of developing a semi-supervised approach for derivational nouns. They hint at the use of labeled and unlabeled datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Digital Corpus of Sanskrit**: A large corpus of Sanskrit texts.
2. **The Sanskrit Library**: A collection of Sanskrit texts.
3. **GRETIL**: A digital library of Sanskrit texts.
4. **IndoWordNet**: A lexical database for Sanskrit.
5. **Sanskrit2**: A digitized version of the Monier Williams Sanskrit-English dictionary.
6. **Apte Sanskrit-Sanskrit Dictionary**: A dictionary of Sanskrit words.
7. **Sanskrit Heritage Engine**: A platform for Sanskrit language processing.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Digital Corpus of Sanskrit**, the citation is:
  > Krishna and Goyal (2015) automated the generation of derivative nouns in Sanskrit using the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit.

- For **The Sanskrit Library**, the citation is:
  > The Sanskrit Library is a collection of Sanskrit texts.

- For **GRETIL**, the citation is:
  > GRETIL is a digital library of Sanskrit texts.

- For **IndoWordNet**, the citation is:
  > Kulka-the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit et al. (2010) introduced Sanskrit WordNet.

- For **Sanskrit2**, the citation is:
  > Kulka-the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit et al. (2010) introduced Sanskrit WordNet.

- For **Apte Sanskrit-Sanskrit Dictionary**, the citation is:
  > Vazquez et al. (2012) used the Apte Sanskrit-Sanskrit Dictionary for their work.

- For **Sanskrit Heritage Engine**, the citation is:
  > Goyal and Huet (2016) designed and analyzed the Sanskrit Heritage Engine.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
