To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A MARVS Analysis of Two Chinese Near-Synonymous Verbs of Jumping" by Yingying Peng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of two large Chinese corpora, GigaWord2 and the CCL corpus, to analyze the near-synonymous verbs beng4 and tiao4.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of distinguishing near-synonyms, particularly near-synonymous verbs, and introduce the Module-Attribute Representation of Verbal Semantics (MARVS) model.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention two large Chinese corpora:

1. **GigaWord2**: A large corpus containing more than 800 million PoS tagged words from three varieties of Mandarin Chinese: Taiwan, Mainland China, and Singapore.
2. **CCL**: A corpus containing 783,463,175 Chinese characters and its data was extracted from both modern and classical Chinese.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for the analysis of beng4 and tiao4.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **GigaWord2**, the citation is:
  > Huang, J.-F. (2009). Tagged chinese gigaword version2.0, ldc2009t14. Linguistic Data Consortium.

- For **CCL**, the citation is:
  > Zhan, W., Guo, R., Chang, B., Chen, Y., and Chen, L. (2019). The building of the ccl corpus: its design and implementation. Corp. Ling, 6:77a86.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
