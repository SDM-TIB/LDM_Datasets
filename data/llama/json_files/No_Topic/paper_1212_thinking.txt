To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the 13th Workshop on Multiword Expressions (MWE 2017)", I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of compositionality degrees for German noun-noun compounds and particle verbs, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of addressing the compositionality of complex words and mention the use of gold standards for noun-noun compounds and particle verbs.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SdeWaC (v.3)**: A corpus of parsable sentences from the web.
2. **GS-NN**: A gold standard for German noun-noun compounds.
3. **GS-PV**: A gold standard for German particle verbs.
4. **JNLPBA**: A corpus annotating proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
5. **BC2GM**: A corpus for gene mention recognition.
6. **CHEMDNER**: A corpus for drug and chemical names extraction.
7. **Gold standard for NCs**: A gold standard for German noun-noun compounds.
8. **Gold standard for PVs**: A gold standard for German particle verbs.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
