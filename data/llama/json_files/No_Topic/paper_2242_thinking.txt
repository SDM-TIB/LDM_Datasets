To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the Workshop on Speech and Language Processing Tools in Education, pages 25a36,COLING 2012, Mumbai, December 2012.25An Issue-oriented Syllabus Retrieval System based on Terminology-based Syllabus Structuring and Visualization Hideki Mima1 (1) School of Engineering, University of Tokyo, Hongo 7-3-1, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan mima@t-adm.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp n ABSTRACT The purpose of this research was to develop an issue-oriented syllabus retrieval system that combined terminological processing, information retrieval, similarity calculation-based document clustering, and visualization. Recently, scientific knowledge has grown explosively because of rapid advancements that have occurred in academia and society. Because of this dramatic expansion of knowledge, learners and educators sometimes struggle to comprehend the overall aspects of syllabi. In addition, learners may find it difficult to discover appropriate courses of study from syllabi because of the increasing growth of interdisciplinary studies programs. We believe that an issue-oriented syllabus structure might be more efficient because it provides clear directions for users. In this paper, we introduce an issue-oriented automatic syllabus retrieval system that integrates automatic term recognition as an issue extraction, and similarity calculation as terminology-based document clustering. We use automatically-recognized terms to represent each lecture in clustering and visualization. Retrieved syllabi are automatically classified based on their included terms or issues. The main goal of syllabus retrieval and classification is the development of an issue-oriented syllabus retrieval website that will present users with distilled knowledge in a concise form. The system is currently in practical use for issue-oriented syllabus retrieval and clustering for the University of Tokyoas Open Course Ware and for the School/Department of Engineering. Usability evaluations based on questionnaires used to survey over 100 students revealed that our proposed system is sufficiently efficient at syllabus retrieval. KEYWORDS: Issue oriented, syllabus retrieval, visualization term extraction, knowledge structuring, 261 Introduction Recently, scientific knowledge has grown explosively because of rapid advancements that have occurred in academia and society.1 This rapid expansion of knowledge has made it increasingly difficult for learners and educators to comprehend the overall aspects of syllabi. In addition, because of the rapid growth of interdisciplinary studies programs, such as energy studies and earth-environmental studies, learners have found it increasingly difficult to discover appropriate courses of study in their syllabi. Syllabus retrieval is believed to be one of several solutions to these problems. In fact, several syllabus retrieval systems have been proposed. In general, current syllabus retrieval methods can be classified as query-oriented and/or issue-oriented. Although the query-oriented method is useful and possesses strong retrieval capabilities, it can be difficult to employ, especially for novices, because the generation of queries usually requires users to first clarify their subjects. The issue-oriented syllabus retrieval method was developed in an attempt to provide clear directions to learners. The issue-oriented syllabus structure is believed to be more efficient for learning and education, because it requires less knowledge about subjects (Mima et al., 2006). However, this system generally requires that users classify all syllabi manually in advance. This can be a time-consuming task. Thus, we can see that it is important to develop a more efficient method for automatic syllabus structuring to accelerate syllabus classification. The advantage of this technique is based on the assumption that automatic methods will enable more efficient processing of enormous amounts of syllabi texts. In this paper, we introduce an innovative issue-oriented automatic syllabus classification system. We integrate automatic term recognition as issue extraction, terminology-based similarity-calculation for clustering, information retrieval, and visualization. Automatically-recognized terms are used to represent each lecture in clustering and visualization. Retrieved syllabi are automatically classified based on their included terms or issues. The main goal of syllabus retrieval and classification is the development of an issue-oriented syllabus retrieval website that will present users with distilled knowledge in a concise form. The advantage of this system, in comparison with conventional systems, simple keyword-based syllabus retrieval is based on the assumption that our methods can provide users, and, in particular, novice users (students), with efficient lecture retrieval from an enormous number of syllabi. The system is currently in practical use for issue-oriented syllabus retrieval and clustering for the University of Tokyoas Open Course Ware and for the School/Department of Engineering. Usability evaluations based on questionnaires used to survey over 100 students revealed that our proposed system is sufficiently efficient at syllabus retrieval.
