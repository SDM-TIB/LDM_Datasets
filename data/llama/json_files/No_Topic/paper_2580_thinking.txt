To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MuST-C: a Multilingual Speech Translation Corpus" by Mattia Antonino Di Gangi, Roldano Cattoni, Luisa Bentivogli, Matteo Negri, and Marco Turchi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the creation of MuST-C, a multilingual speech translation corpus.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the scarcity of training corpora for end-to-end speech translation models and the need for a large, high-quality multilingual corpus.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **TED Talks corpus**: This corpus is used for creating the MuST-C corpus.
2. **IWSLT18 corpus**: This corpus is used for comparison with MuST-C.
3. **Fisher and Callhome corpus**: This corpus is used for comparison with MuST-C.
4. **LibriSpeech corpus**: This corpus is used for comparison with MuST-C.
5. **Griko-Italian corpus**: This corpus is used for comparison with MuST-C.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **TED Talks corpus**, the citation is:
  > www.ted.com a dump of April 2018.

- For **IWSLT18 corpus**, the citation is:
  > Niehues et al. (2018)

- For **Fisher and Callhome corpus**, the citation is:
  > Post et al. (2013)

- For **LibriSpeech corpus**, the citation is:
  > LibriSpeech corpus (Volske et al., 2017)

- For **Griko-Italian corpus**, the citation is:
  > Boito et al. (2018)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
