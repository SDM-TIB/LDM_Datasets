To extract datasets from the research paper titled "1066ReVal: A Simple and Effective Machine Translation Evaluation MetricBased on Recurrent Neural Networks" by Rohit Gupta, Constantin Orasan, and Josef van Genabith, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of machine translation metrics, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional machine translation evaluation metrics and the need for a new approach. They hint at the use of dense vector spaces and recurrent neural networks.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **WMT-13 ranks corpus**: This dataset is used to automatically derive training data for the ReVal metric.
2. **SICK training set**: This dataset is used to evaluate the ReVal metric on semantic similarity tasks.
3. **SICK development set**: This dataset is used to evaluate the ReVal metric on semantic similarity tasks.
4. **SICK test set**: This dataset is used to evaluate the ReVal metric on semantic similarity tasks.
5. **L+Sick(50,150)**: This dataset is used to evaluate the ReVal metric on machine translation tasks.
6. **L+Sick(100,300)**: This dataset is used to evaluate the ReVal metric on machine translation tasks.
7. **L+Sick(50,150)**: This dataset is used to evaluate the ReVal metric on machine translation tasks.
8. **L+Sick(mix)**: This dataset is used to evaluate the ReVal metric on machine translation tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the ReVal metric.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
