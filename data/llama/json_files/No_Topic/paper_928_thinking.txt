    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proceedings of the 13th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 686a695, Avignon, France, April 23 - 27 2012. c2012 Association for Computational Linguistics" by Yuichiroh Matsubaya, Yusuke Miyao, and Akiko Aizawa, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the proposed framework for semantic role assignment, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing resources for semantic parsing, such as PropBank and FrameNet, and propose a new framework based on Extended Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS).

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **PropBank**: A large corpus of annotated sentences for semantic role labeling.
2. **FrameNet**: A lexical database that provides semantic roles for verbs and nouns.
3. **VerbNet**: A lexical database that provides semantic roles for verbs.
4. **Kyoto University Text Corpus (KTC)**: A large corpus of Japanese text.
5. **Digital Daijisen**: An online Japanese dictionary.
6. **Kyoto University case frames**: A compilation of case frames automatically acquired from a huge web corpus.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PropBank**, the citation is:
  > Kingsbury, P., & Palmer, M. (2002). From Treebank to PropBank: Lexicalizing grammatical structure. Computational Linguistics, 30(2), 161–202.

- For **FrameNet**, the citation is:
  > Ruppenhofer, M., Ellsworth, M., Petruck, M. R. L., Johnson, C. R., & Scheffczyk, J. (2006). FrameNet II: Extended theory and practice. Berkeley FrameNet Release, 1.

- For **VerbNet**, the citation is:
  > Kipper, K., Dang, H. T., & Palmer, M. (2000). Class-based construction of a verb lexicon. Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 691–696.

- For **Kyoto University Text Corpus (KTC)**, the citation is:
  > Kurohashi, S., & Nagao, M. (1997). Kyoto University text corpus project. Proceedings of the Annual Conference of JSAI, 58–61.

- For **Digital Daijisen**, the citation is:
  > Available at http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/jn/.

- For **Kyoto University case frames**, the citation is:
  > Kawahara, D., & Kurohashi, S. (2006). Case frame compilation from the web using high-performance computing. Proceedings of LREC-2006, 1344–1347.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
