To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentiable Ranks and Sorting using Optimal Transport" by Marco Cuturi, Olivier Teboul, and Jean-Philippe Vert, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of sorting and ranking operations using optimal transport, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of sorting and ranking operations and the importance of developing differentiable proxies for these operations. They hint at the evaluation of these operations on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class.
3. **MNIST**: A dataset of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
4. **MNIST**: A dataset of 50,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their sorting and ranking operations, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., & Hinton, G. E. (2012). ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) (pp. 1097-1105).

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
