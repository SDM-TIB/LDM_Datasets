To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CROSS-ENTROPY LOSS LEADS TO POOR MARGINS" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the binary classification of linearly separable datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of cross-entropy loss function and its association with the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the empirical distribution of a dataset and the confidence of the classifier for that dataset. They hint at the evaluation of this loss function on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the CIFAR-10 dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the CIFAR-10 dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, Alex, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
