To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UNSUPERVISED HYPERALIGNMENT FOR MULTILIN-GUAL WORD EMBEDDINGS" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the problem of aligning continuous word representations, learned in multiple languages, to a common space. It also mentions the use of publicly available embeddings in many languages mapped into a single common vector space.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of monolingual embeddings and the importance of aligning multiple languages to a common space.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the MUSE test datasets, which are used to evaluate the proposed method.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the MUSE test datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For MUSE, the citation is:
  > Conneau et al. (2017) use the MUSE test datasets to evaluate their method.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
