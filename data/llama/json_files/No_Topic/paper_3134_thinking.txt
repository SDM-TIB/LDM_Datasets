To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simultaneous Object Detection and Ranking with Weak Supervision" by Matthew B. Blaschko, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the INRIA pedestrian detection dataset and the PASCAL VOC dataset.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the problem of learning object category detectors with weak supervision and mention the INRIA pedestrian detection dataset and the PASCAL VOC dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the INRIA pedestrian detection dataset and the PASCAL VOC dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **INRIA pedestrian detection dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dalal, Y. & Triggs, B. (2005). Histogram of Oriented Gradients for Human Detection. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, volume 2, pages 886-893, 2005.

- For **PASCAL VOC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K. I., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2010). The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2007 (VOC2007) Results. http://www.pascal-voc.org/results.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
