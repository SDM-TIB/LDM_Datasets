To extract datasets from the research paper titled "JBNU-CCLab at SemEval-2022 Task 7: DeBERTa for Identifying Plausible Clarifications in Instructional Texts" by Daewook Kang, Sung-Min Lee, Eunhwan Park, and Seung-Hoon Na, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the WikiHow dataset and the SemEval-2022 Task 7 dataset.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of the WikiHow dataset and the SemEval-2022 Task 7 dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **WikiHow**: A large how-to website with more than 300,000 articles and over 2.5M registered users.
2. **SemEval-2022 Task 7**: A task that evaluates the ability of an NLP system to distinguish between plausible and implausible clarifications of an instruction.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WikiHow**, no specific citation is mentioned in the paper.
- For **SemEval-2022 Task 7**, the citation is:
  > Michael Roth, Talita Anthonio, and Anna Sauer. 2022. SemEval-2022 Task 7: Identifying plausible clarifications of implicit and underspecified phrases in instructional texts. In Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2022). Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
