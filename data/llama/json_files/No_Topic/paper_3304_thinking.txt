To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Collectively Representing Semi-Structured Data from the Web" by Bhavana Dalvi, William W. Cohen, and Jamie Callan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of publicly available semi-structured datasets from the Web.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing methods for representing semi-structured data and the importance of developing a single low-dimensional representation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **entity-tableColumn co-occurrence dataset**: This dataset is used for entity-table co-occurrence analysis.
2. **Hyponym Concept dataset**: This dataset is used for hyponym concept analysis.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **entity-tableColumn co-occurrence dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dalvi, B., Callan, J., and Cohen, W. (2012). Websets: Extracting sets of entities from the web using unsupervised information extraction. In WSDM.

- For **Hyponym Concept dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dalvi, B., Cohen, W., and Callan, J. (2012). Websets: Extracting sets of entities from the web using unsupervised information extraction. In WSDM.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
