To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Partial Occlusion Handling for Visual Tracking via Robust Part Matching" by Tianzhu Zhang, Kui Jia, Changsheng Xu, Yi Ma, and Narendra Ahuja, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed Part Matching Tracker (PMT) on challenging benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing part-based visual tracking methods and the importance of leveraging spatial-temporal locality-constrained property for robust part matching.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Frames from three different video sequences with partial occlusion**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the proposed PMT tracker.
2. **Qualitative results via robust part matching of multiple frames**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the proposed PMT tracker.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of the proposed PMT tracker.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Frames from three different video sequences with partial occlusion**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

- For **Qualitative results via robust part matching of multiple frames**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
