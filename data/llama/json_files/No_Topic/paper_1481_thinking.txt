    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Dataset and Explorer for 3D Signed Distance Functions" by Towaki Takikawa, Andrew Glassner, Morgan McGuire, and others, I will follow a systematic approach.

    First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the creation of a dataset of 63 curated, optimized, and regularized signed distance functions.

    In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of reference datasets for algorithm development and the focus on signed distance functions (SDFs) in computer graphics.

    Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the dataset used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention a dataset of 63 curated, optimized, and regularized SDFs.

    In the **results section**, the authors confirm that this dataset was used for evaluation.

    Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for this dataset:
