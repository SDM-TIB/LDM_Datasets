To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Identiication of Participant Slots in Contracts" by Dan Simonson, BlackBoiler, Syracuse, NY, US, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of annotated data for slot extraction in contracts, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of identifying participant slots in contracts and the need for a robust technique. They mention that prior work on contract language is extensive, but there is a lack of research on participant slots.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for annotation. Here, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Contract Corpus**: This dataset is used for annotation of participant slots in contracts.
2. **FrameNet**: This dataset is used for comparison with the proposed slot extraction technique.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and evaluation of their model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Contract Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Dan Simonson, Daniel Broderick, and Jonathan Herr. *The Extent of Repetition in Contract Language*. In Proceedings of the Natural Legal Language Processing Workshop 2019, pages 21a30, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **FrameNet**, the citation is:
  > Baker, P., Fillmore, C., & Lowe, J. B. (1998). The Berkeley Framenet Project. Proceedings of the 36th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and 17th International Conference on Computational Linguistics-Volume 1, pages 86a90. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
