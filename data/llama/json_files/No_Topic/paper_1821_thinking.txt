To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TAC at SemEval-2020 Task 12: Ensembling Approach for MultilingualOffensive Language Identiication in Social Media" by Talha AnwarMirza Omer Beg, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various datasets for offensive language detection in multiple languages.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of detecting offensive language on social media and mention the SemEval 2020 task 12.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for the task. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SemEval 2020 task 12 dataset**: This dataset consists of offensive and non-offensive tweets in five languages: Arabic, Turkish, English, Greek, and Danish.
2. **OLID dataset**: This dataset is used for English language task only.
3. **SOLID dataset**: This dataset is used for English language task only.
4. **FastText embeddings**: This is not a dataset but a technique used for word representation.
5. **GloVe embeddings**: This is not a dataset but a technique used for word representation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for the task.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SemEval 2020 task 12 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marcos Zampieri, Preslav Nakov, Sara Rosenthal, Pepa Atanasova, Georgi Karadzhov, Hamdy Mubarak, Leon Derczynski, Zeses Pitenis, and CA aEgrA CA A oltekin. *SemEval-2020 Task 12: Multilingual Offensive Language Identiication in Social Media (OffensEval 2020).* In Proceedings of SemEval. 2020.

- For **OLID dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sara Rosenthal, Pepa Atanasova, Georgi Karadzhov, Marcos Zampieri, and Preslav Nakov. *A large-scale semi-supervised dataset for offensive language identiication.* arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.14454. 2020.

- For **SOLID dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sara Rosenthal, Pepa Atanasova, Georgi Karadzhov, Marcos Zampieri, and Preslav Nakov. *A large-scale semi-supervised dataset for offensive language identiication.* arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.14454. 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
