To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Social Media Posts as Knowledge Resource for Generating Life Stories" by Robee Khyra Mae J. TeDe La Salle University, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of Facebook data to generate life stories, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of storytelling and the use of social media platforms to share life events. They hint at the evaluation of the system using a dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Facebook dataset**: This dataset is used for training and testing the life story generator.
2. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: This dataset is used for gene recognition tasks.
3. **JNLPBA corpus**: This corpus annotates proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
4. **CHEMDNER corpus**: This dataset is focused on annotating drugs and chemicals.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Facebook dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **BC2GM**, the citation is:
  > Larry Smith, Lorraine K Tanabe, Rie Johnson nee Ando, Cheng-Ju Kuo, I-Fang Chung, Chun-Nan Hsu, Yu-Shi Lin, Roman Klinger, Christoph M Friedrich, Kuzman Ganchev, et al. *Overview of biocreative ii gene mention recognition*. Genome biology, 9(Suppl 2):1–19, 2008. https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2008-9-s2-s2

- For **JNLPBA**, the citation is:
  > Jin-Dong Kim, Tomoko Ohta, Yoshimasa Tsuruoka, Yuka Tateisi, and Nigel Collier. *Introduction to the bio-entity recognition task at JNLPBA*. In Proceedings of the 2004 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), pages 70–75, 2004. http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-1213

- For **CHEMDNER**, the citation is:
  > Martin Krallinger, Florian Leitner, Obdulia Rabal, Miguel Vazquez, Julen Oyarzabal, and Alfonso Valencia. *CHEMDNER: The drugs and chemical names extraction challenge*. Journal of Cheminformatics, 7(Suppl 1):S1, 2015. https://doi.org/10.1186/1758-2946-7-S1-S1

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
