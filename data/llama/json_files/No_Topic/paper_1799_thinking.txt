To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Mid-level Filters for Person Re-identiication" by Rui Zhao, Wanli Ouyang, and Xiaogang Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the VIPeR and CUHK01 datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of person re-identiication and the limitations of existing approaches.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the VIPeR and CUHK01 datasets.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **VIPeR**, the citation is:
  > D. Gray, S. Brennan, and H. Tao. Evaluating appearance models for recognition, reacquisition, and tracking. In PETS, 2007.

- For **CUHK01**, the citation is:
  > W. Li, R. Zhao, and X. Wang. Human reidentiication with transferred metric learning. In ACCV, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
