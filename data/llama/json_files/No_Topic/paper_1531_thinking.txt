To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modelling Regular Subcategorization Changes in German Particle Verbs" by Stefan Bott and Sabine Schulte im Walde, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the German particle verbs, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous studies and the importance of modeling subcategorization changes in German particle verbs. They hint at the use of existing datasets for this task.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SDeWaC corpus**: A corpus of nearly 885 million words.
2. **Fleischer and Barz's dataset**: A dataset of 100 particle verbs for both the particle "an" and "auf".
3. **JNLPBA dataset**: A dataset of 32 particle verbs, including 14 with the particle "an" and 18 with the particle "auf".
4. **CHEMDNER dataset**: A dataset of chemical entities.
5. **WordNet**: A lexical database.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SDeWaC corpus**, the citation is:
  > Gertrud FaaA and Kerstin Eckart. 2013. SdeWaC a a Corpus of Parsable Sentences from the Web. In Proceedings of the International Conference of the German Society for Computational Linguistics and Language Technology, Darmstadt, Germany.

- For **Fleischer and Barz's dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wolfgang Fleischer and Irmhild Barz. 2012. Wortbildung der deutschen Gegenwartssprache. Walter de Gruyter, 4th edition.

- For **JNLPBA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jin-Dong Kim, Tomoko Ohta, Yoshimasa Tsuruoka, Yuka Tateisi, and Nigel Collier. 2004. Introduction to the bio-entity recognition task at JNLPBA. In Proceedings of the 2004 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), pages 70â€“75, 2004.

- For **CHEMDNER dataset**, the citation is:
  > Martin Krallinger, Florian Leitner, Obdulia Rabal, Miguel Vazquez, Julen Oyarzabal, and Alfonso Valencia. 2015. CHEMDNER: The drugs and chemical names extraction challenge. Journal of Cheminformatics, 7(Suppl 1):S1, 2015.

- For **WordNet**, the citation is:
  > The WordNet database.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
