To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Section-Aware Commonsense Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Generation with Pre-trained Language Model" by Sixing Wu, Ying Li, Minghui Wang, Dawei Zhang, Yang Zhou, and Zhonghai Wu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the dialogue generation task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of commonsense knowledge in dialogue generation and the limitations of using pre-trained language models.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the Weibo dataset and the ConceptNet dataset:

1. **Weibo dataset**: This dataset is used for dialogue generation tasks.
2. **ConceptNet dataset**: This dataset is used for commonsense knowledge grounding.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Weibo dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sixing Wu, Minghui Wang, Dawei Zhang, Yang Zhou, and Zhonghai Wu. *Diverse and informative dialogue generation with context-specific commonsense knowledge awareness*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 5811–5820, 2020.

- For **ConceptNet dataset**, the citation is:
  > Richard Mitchell, Patrick Haffner, and Christopher Welty. *Sparql 1.1 query results for conceptnet 5.5*. In Proceedings of the 2017 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pages 3422–3423, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
