To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalizable Person Re-Identification Without Demographics" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for direct cross-data evaluation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional person re-identification methods and the importance of learning domain-invariant representations without demographics.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CUHK02**: A large-scale dataset for person re-identification.
2. **CUHK03**: A large-scale dataset for person re-identification.
3. **Market1501**: A large-scale dataset for person re-identification.
4. **DukeMTMC-ReID**: A large-scale dataset for person re-identification.
5. **CUHK-SYSU PersonSearch**: A large-scale dataset for person re-identification.
6. **VIPeR**: A large-scale dataset for person re-identification.
7. **PRID**: A large-scale dataset for person re-identification.
8. **QMULGRID**: A large-scale dataset for person re-identification.
9. **i-LIDS**: A large-scale dataset for person re-identification.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CUHK02**, the citation is:
  > Li & Wang (2013)

- For **CUHK03**, the citation is:
  > Li et al. (2014)

- For **Market1501**, the citation is:
  > Zheng et al. (2015)

- For **DukeMTMC-ReID**, the citation is:
  > Zheng et al. (2017)

- For **CUHK-SYSU PersonSearch**, the citation is:
  > Xiao et al. (2016)

- For **VIPeR**, the citation is:
  > Gray et al. (2007)

- For **PRID**, the citation is:
  > Hirzer et al. (2011)

- For **QMULGRID**, the citation is:
  > Liu et al. (2012)

- For **i-LIDS**, the citation is:
  > Wei-Shi et al. (2009)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
