To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LOCALIZED RANDOM PROJECTIONS FOR BIO-PLAUSIBLE DEEP LEARNING CHALLENGE" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional deep learning models and the importance of developing more bio-plausible models. They hint at the evaluation of their proposed model on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A dataset of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
2. **CIFAR10**: A dataset of 32x32 color images of objects in 10 classes.
3. **PCA**: A dataset of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, used for Principal Component Analysis.
4. **SC**: A dataset of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, used for Sparse Coding.
5. **RP**: A dataset of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, used for Random Projections.
6. **BP**: A dataset of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, used for Backpropagation.
7. **FA**: A dataset of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, used for Feedback Alignment.
8. **LIF rate**: A dataset of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, used for LIF rate model.
9. **LIF spiking**: A dataset of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, used for LIF spiking model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
