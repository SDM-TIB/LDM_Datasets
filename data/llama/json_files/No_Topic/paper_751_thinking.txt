To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PDTB-style Discourse Annotation of Chinese Text" by Yuping Zhou and Nianwen Xue, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the PDTB-style Discourse Annotation of Chinese Text, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors describe a discourse annotation scheme for Chinese that adopts the lexically grounded approach of the PDTB.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005)**: This dataset is used for discourse annotation.
2. **Xinhua newswire**: This dataset is used for annotation experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Chinese Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Fei Xia, Fu dong Chiou, and Martha Palmer. *The Penn Chinese TreeBank: PhraseStructure Annotation of a Large Corpus*. Natural Language Engineering, 11(2):207-238, 2005.

- For **Xinhua newswire**, the citation is:
  > Nianwen Xue. *Annotating the Discourse Connectives in the Chinese Treebank*. In Proceedings of the ACL Workshop on Frontiers in Corpus Annotation, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
