To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Native Language Identiication using Phonetic Algorithms" by Charese Smiley and Sandra K. Aubler, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the IUCL system in the NLI Shared Task 2017, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the task of Native Language Identiication (NLI) and the importance of phonetic features. They hint at the use of various datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **TOEFL11 corpus**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of NLI systems.
2. **IUCL system dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation of the IUCL system.
3. **NLI 2017 shared task dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluation of NLI systems in the shared task.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **TOEFL11 corpus**, the citation is:
  > Tetreault, J., Blanchard, D., & Cahill, A. (2013). A Report on the First Native Language Identiication Shared Task. In Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop on Building Educational Applications Using NLP. Association for Computational Linguistics, Atlanta, GA, USA.

- For **IUCL system dataset**, the citation is:
  > Malmasi, S., Zampieri, M., Ljubešić, N., Nakov, P., Ali, A., & Tiedemann, J. (2017). A Report on the 2017 Native Language Identiication Shared Task. In Proceedings of the 12th Workshop on Building Educational Applications Using NLP. Copenhagen, Denmark.

- For **NLI 2017 shared task dataset**, the citation is:
  > Malmasi, S., Zampieri, M., Ljubešić, N., Nakov, P., Ali, A., & Tiedemann, J. (2017). A Report on the 2017 Native Language Identiication Shared Task. In Proceedings of the 12th Workshop on Building Educational Applications Using NLP. Copenhagen, Denmark.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
