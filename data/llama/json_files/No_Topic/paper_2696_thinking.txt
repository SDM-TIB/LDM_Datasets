To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SSFD: Self-Supervised Feature Distance as an MRImage Reconstruction Quality Metric" by Philip M. Adamson et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the fastMRI knee dataset for accelerated MR image reconstruction tasks.

In the **methods section**, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **fastMRI knee dataset**: This dataset is used for accelerated MR image reconstruction tasks.
2. **JSENSE dataset**: This dataset is used to compute reference images from fully-sampled k-space data with coil sensitivities.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **fastMRI knee dataset**, the citation is:
  > Florian Knoll, Jure Zbontar, Anuroop Sriram, Matthew J Muckley, Mary Bruno, Aaron Defazio, Marc Parente, Krzysztof J Geras, Joe Katsnelson, Hersh Chandarana, Zizhao Zhang, Michal Drozdzal, Adriana Romero, Michael Rabbat, Pascal Vincent, James Pinkerton, Duo Wang, Naissa Yakubova, Erich Owens, C Lawrence Zitnick, Michael P Recht, Daniel K Sodickson, and Yvonne W Lui. fastmri: A publicly available raw k-space and dicom dataset of knee images for accelerated mr image reconstruction using machine learning. Radiol Artif Intell, 2(1):e190007, Jan 2020. https://doi.org/10.1093/radiol/raaa046

- For **JSENSE dataset**, the citation is:
  > Leslie Ying and Jinhua Sheng. Joint image reconstruction and sensitivity estimation in sense (JSense). Magnetic Resonance in Medicine: An Oficial Journal of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, 57(6):1196â€“1202, 2007. https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.22321

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
