To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Semantic Type Representation for Zero-Shot Event Extraction" by Hongming Zhang, Haoyu Wang, and Dan Roth, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the ACE2005 dataset and the ACE guideline, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of supervised methods for event extraction and the importance of zero-shot learning methods. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the ACE2005 dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the ACE2005 dataset was used for evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ACE2005 dataset:

- For ACE2005, the citation is:
  > Zhang et al. (2021) proposed a zero-shot framework for event extraction, but they used the ACE2005 dataset for training and testing.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
