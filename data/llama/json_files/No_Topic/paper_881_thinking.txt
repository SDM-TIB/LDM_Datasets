To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TOWARD EFFICIENT LOW-PRECISION TRAINING:DATA FORMAT OPTIMIZATION AND HYSTERESISQUANTIZATIONSunwoo Lee, Jeongwoo Park, Dongsuk Jeon" by Sunwoo Lee, Jeongwoo Park, and Dongsuk Jeon, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **introduction, section 2.1, and section 2.4** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The introduction mentions various quantized training environments and performance degradation in quantized models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In section 2.1, the authors discuss various numeric formats that can be constructed with n bits, including 8-bit ixed-point integer format, 8-bit ioating-point formats such as FP152, FP143, and FP125, 8-bit posit format, and 8-bit ioat-ix format.

In section 2.4, the authors select six models with different architectures, layer types, and target tasks that are widely used in quantized training research for experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their descriptions from the paper.
