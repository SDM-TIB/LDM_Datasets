To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Embed Multi-Modal Contexts for Situated Conversational Agents" by Anonymous, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the SIMMC 2.0 dataset, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of multi-modal task-oriented dialog systems and the SIMMC 2.0 dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the SIMMC 2.0 dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the SIMMC 2.0 dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SIMMC 2.0 dataset:

> Satwik Kottur, Seungwhan Moon, Alborz Geramifard, and Babak Damavandi. *Situated and interactive multimodal conversations*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, COLING 2020, Barcelona, Spain (Online), December 8-13, 2020, pages 1103-1121.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
