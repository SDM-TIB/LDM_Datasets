    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Exact Penalty Method for Locally Convergent Maximum Consensus" by Huu Le, Tat-Jun Chin, and David Suter, I will follow a systematic approach.

    First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of algorithms for maximum consensus estimation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

    In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing algorithms for maximum consensus estimation and the importance of developing new methods.

    Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

    1. **RANSAC**: A widely used algorithm for maximum consensus estimation.
    2. **Least Squares**: A method for estimating model parameters.
    3. **LO-RANSAC**: A variant of RANSAC with an inner hypothesize-and-verify routine.
    4. **Guided MLESAC**: A variant of RANSAC with a guided sampling approach.
    5. **PROSAC**: A variant of RANSAC with a progressive sampling approach.
    6. **VGG dataset**: A dataset used for image recognition tasks.
    7. **Notre Dame dataset**: A dataset used for 3D point cloud processing tasks.
    8. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: A dataset used for gene recognition tasks.
    9. **JNLPBA corpus**: A dataset used for protein annotation tasks.
    10. **CHEMDNER corpus**: A dataset used for chemical annotation tasks.
