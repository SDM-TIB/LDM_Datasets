To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neuralizing Regular Expressions for Slot Filling" by Chengyue Jiang, Zijian Jina, Kewei Tu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the integration of neural networks and regular expressions for slot filling, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the integration of neural networks and regular expressions for slot filling, which hints at the use of datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named entity recognition corpora:

1. **ATIS**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of slot filling models.
2. **ATIS-ZH**: This dataset is the Chinese version of ATIS and is used for evaluating the performance of slot filling models.
3. **SNIPS**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of slot filling models.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ATIS**, the citation is:
  > Hemphill, J. J., Godfrey, J. J., & Doddington, G. R. (1990). The ATIS spoken language systems pilot corpus. In Speech and Natural Language: Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Hidden Valley, Pennsylvania, June 24-27, 1990.

- For **ATIS-ZH**, the citation is:
  > Mansour, S., & Haider, B. (2021). ATIS seven languages ldc2021t04. In Philadelphia: Linguistic Data Consortium, 2021.

- For **SNIPS**, the citation is:
  > Coucke, A., Saade, Y., Ball, A., Bluche, T., Caulier, A., Lavril, T.,... & Duereau, J. (2018). Snips voice platform: An embedded spoken language understanding system for private-by-design voice interfaces. CoRR, abs/1805.10190.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
