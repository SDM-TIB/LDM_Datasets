To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hardware Compliant Approximate Image Codes" by Da Kuang, Alex Gittens, and Raffay Hamid, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of multiple standard datasets for empirical analysis, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing feature encoding schemes and the importance of developing more efficient and accurate methods. They hint at the evaluation of these methods on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Caltech-101**: A dataset of 101 object categories.
2. **Caltech-256**: A dataset of 256 object categories.
3. **Pascal VOC 2007**: A dataset of 20 object categories.
4. **MIT Scenes**: A dataset of 50 scenes.
5. **LLC**: A dataset used for evaluation of the exact LLC encoding scheme.
6. **Assigna**: A dataset used for evaluation of the aAssigna encoding scheme.
7. **Encode**: A dataset used for evaluation of the aEncode encoding scheme.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their methods, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Caltech-101**, the citation is:
  > Fei-Fei Li, Lawrence Davis, and Thomas H. Kanade. *Learning generative visual models from few examples*. In Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 426a433, 2004.

- For **Caltech-256**, the citation is:
  > L. Fei-Fei Li, R. Fergus, and P. Perona. *Learning generative visual models from few training examples: An incremental Bayesian approach tested on 101 object categories*. Comput. Vis. Image Underst., 106(1):59a70, 2007.

- For **Pascal VOC 2007**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The Pascal visual object classes (VOC) challenge*. Int. J. Comput. Vision, 88(2):303a338, 2010.

- For **MIT Scenes**, the citation is:
  > A. Quattoni and A. Torralba. *Recognizing indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 413a420, 2009.

- For **LLC**, the citation is:
  > J. Wang, J. Yang, K. Yu, F. Lv, T. Huang, and Y. Gong. *Locality-constrained linear coding for image classification*. In Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3360a3367, 2010.

- For **Assigna**, the citation is:
  > K. Chatield, V. Lempitsky, A. Vedaldi, and A. Zisserman. *The devil is in the details: an evaluation of recent feature encoding methods*. In Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 76.1a76.12, 2011.

- For **Encode**, the citation is:
  > S. Lazebnik, C. Schmid, and J. Ponce. *Beyond bags of features: Spatial pyramid matching for recognizing natural scene categories*. In Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 2169a2178, 2006.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
