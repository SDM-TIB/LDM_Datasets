To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LEXFIT: Lexical Fine-Tuning of Pretrained Language Models" by Ivan VuliA c et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various datasets for lexical semantic similarity, bilingual lexicon induction, and lexical relation prediction tasks.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of WordNet and the Paraphrase Database for lexical specialization.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **WordNet**: A lexical database organized on psycholinguistic principles.
2. **Paraphrase Database**: A database of paraphrases.
3. **Multi-SimLex**: A large-scale evaluation set of lexical semantic similarity.
4. **SimVerb-3500**: A benchmark for verb similarity.
5. **SimLex-999**: A benchmark for lexical similarity.
6. **Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI) datasets**: A set of datasets used for bilingual lexicon induction.
7. **Relation Prediction (RELP) datasets**: A set of datasets used for relation prediction tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WordNet**, the citation is:
  > Richard Beckwith, Christiane Fellbaum, Derek Gross, and George A. Miller. 1991. WordNet: A lexical database organized on psycholinguistic principles.

- For **Paraphrase Database**, the citation is:
  > Juri Ganitkevitch, Benjamin Van Durme, and Chris Callison-Burch. 2013. Callison-Burch. 2013. Corpus (Volske et al., 2017).

- For **Multi-SimLex**, the citation is:
  > Fangyu Liu, Ivan VuliA c, Anna Korhonen, and Nigel Collier. 2021. Fast, effective and self-supervised: Transforming masked language models into universal lexical and sentence encoders.

- For **SimVerb-3500**, the citation is:
  > Daniela Gerz, Ivan VuliA c, Felix Hill, Roi Reichart, and Anna Korhonen. 2016. SimVerb-3500: A large-scale evaluation set of verb similarity.

- For **SimLex-999**, the citation is:
  > Felix Hill, Roi Reichart, and Anna Korhonen. 2015. SimLex-999: Evaluating semantic models with (gen-uine) similarity estimation.

- For **Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI) datasets**, the citation is:
  > Mikel Artetxe, Gorka Labaka, and Eneko Agirre. 2018. A robust self-learning method for fully unsupervised cross-lingual mappings of word embeddings.

- For **Relation Prediction (RELP) datasets**, the citation is:
  > Goran GlavaA and Ivan VuliA c. 2018. Discriminating between lexico-semantic relations with the specialization tensor model.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
