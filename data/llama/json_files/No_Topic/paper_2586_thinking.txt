To extract datasets from the Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Dependency Linguistics (DepLing 2013), I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The paper discusses the grammatical markers in the simple clause in Old French and the way they can be described in a dependency framework.

In the paper, the authors mention three previous accounts:

1. Igor MelaEcuk's criteria Ba
2. Thomas GroAas intra-word analysis
3. Alain LemarAchal's concept of speciication

These accounts are used to describe the grammatical markers in Old French.

Next, I will focus on the specific datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Igor MelaEcuk's criteria Ba**: This dataset is not explicitly mentioned, but it is implied to be a collection of examples used to test the criteria.
2. **Thomas GroAas intra-word analysis**: This dataset is not explicitly mentioned, but it is implied to be a collection of examples used to test the intra-word analysis.
3. **Alain LemarAchal's concept of speciication**: This dataset is not explicitly mentioned, but it is implied to be a collection of examples used to test the concept of speciication.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their descriptions from the paper.
