To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-Rank Tensors for Verbs in Compositional Distributional Semantics" by Daniel Fried, Tamara Polajnar, and Stephen Clark, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of Wikipedia corpus and extraction of SVO triples from it, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of full tensors in large-scale implementations and the need for low-rank tensor approximations. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various tasks, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Wikipedia corpus**: This dataset is used for extracting SVO triples and distributional vectors for nouns and SVO triples.
2. **Wikipedia sentence pairs**: This dataset is used for the verb disambiguation task (GS11) and sentence similarity task (KS14).

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Wikipedia corpus**, the citation is:
  > October 2013 download of Wikipedia, tokenized using Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014), lemmatized with the Morpha lemmatizer (Minnen et al., 2001), and parsed using the C&C parser (Curran et al., 2007).

- For **Wikipedia sentence pairs**, the citation is:
  > Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011); Kartsaklis and Sadrzadeh (2014).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
