To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Relationship between Visual Attributes and Convolutional Networks" by Victor Escorcia, Juan Carlos Niebles, and Bernard Ghanem, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the ImageNet dataset and the ImageNet-Attribute dataset.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the ImageNet dataset and its use for training a convolutional network.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the ImageNet dataset and the ImageNet-Attribute dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, I. Sutskever, and G. E. Hinton. *ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2012.

- For **ImageNet-Attribute**, the citation is:
  > Russakovsky, O., Fei-Fei, L. *Attribute learning in large-scale datasets*. In European Conference of Computer Vision (ECCV), International Workshop on Parts and Attributes, 2010.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
