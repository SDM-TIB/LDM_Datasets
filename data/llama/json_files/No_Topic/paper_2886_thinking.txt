To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CI-AVSR: A Cantonese Audio-Visual Speech Dataset for In-car Command Recognition" by Wenliang Dai, Samuel Cahyawijaya, Tiezheng Yu, Elham J. Barezia, Peng Xia, Cheuk Tung Shadow Yiu, Rita Frieske, Holy Lovenia, Genta Indra Winata, Qifeng Chen, Xiaojuan Ma, Bertram E. Shi, Pascale Fung, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dataset, CI-AVSR, for in-car command recognition in the Cantonese language with both video and audio data.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the lack of data for low-resource languages, such as Cantonese, which hinders the development of research and applications. They introduce the CI-AVSR dataset, which consists of 4,984 samples (8.3 hours) of 200 in-car commands recorded by 30 native Cantonese speakers.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CI-AVSR dataset**: This dataset consists of 4,984 samples (8.3 hours) of 200 in-car commands recorded by 30 native Cantonese speakers.
2. **LRS2-BBC dataset**: This dataset contains thousands of hours of spoken sentences from various BBC programs that contain talking faces together with transcripts.
3. **MuSe-CaR dataset**: This dataset is crawled from YouTube and contains 291 videos.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CI-AVSR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wenliang Dai, Samuel Cahyawijaya, Tiezheng Yu, Elham J. Barezia, Peng Xia, Cheuk Tung Shadow Yiu, Rita Frieske, Holy Lovenia, Genta Indra Winata, Qifeng Chen, Xiaojuan Ma, Bertram E. Shi, Pascale Fung. *CI-AVSR: A Cantonese Audio-Visual Speech Dataset for In-car Command Recognition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.09467.

- For **LRS2-BBC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Afouras, T., Chung, J. S., Senior, A., Vinyals, O., and Zisserman, A. *Deep audio-visual speech recognition*. IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence.

- For **MuSe-CaR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stappen, L., Baird, A., Schumann, L., and Schuller, B. *The multimodal sentiment analysis in car reviews (muse-car) dataset: Collection, insights and improvements*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.06053.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
