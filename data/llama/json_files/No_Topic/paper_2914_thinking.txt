To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anlirika: an LSTMaCNN Flow Twister for Spoken Language Identification" by Andrei Shcherbakov et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the CMU Wilderness dataset and the CommonVoice dataset for training and validation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets for spoken language identification and the importance of using diverse datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and validation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CMU Wilderness dataset**: This dataset is used for training.
2. **CommonVoice dataset**: This dataset is used for validation and testing.
3. **Other datasets**: The authors mention that the validation and test datasets were collected from multiple corpora, including the CMU Wilderness dataset, but do not specify the exact datasets.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the CMU Wilderness and CommonVoice datasets were used for training and validation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CMU Wilderness dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alan W Black. 2019. CMU Wilderness multilingual speech dataset. In ICASSP 2019-2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5971â€“5975. IEEE.

- For **CommonVoice dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rosana Ardila, Megan Branson, Kelly Davis, Michael Henretty, Michael Kohler, Josh Meyer, Reuben Morais, Lindsay Saunders, Francis M Tyers, and Gregor Weber. 2019. Common voice: A massively-arXiv preprint multilingual speech corpus.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
