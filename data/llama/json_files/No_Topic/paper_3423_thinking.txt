To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SciPar: A Collection of Parallel Corpora from Scientific Abstracts" by Dimitris Roussis, Vassilis Papavassiliou, Prokopis Prokopidis, Stelios Piperidis, and Vassilis Katsouros, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the creation of a new parallel corpus from openly available metadata of bachelor theses, master theses, and doctoral dissertations hosted in institutional repositories, digital libraries of universities and national archives, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors describe the construction of SciPar, a multilingual parallel corpus of theses and dissertations abstracts with 9.17 million sentence pairs in 31 language pairs, covering many European languages.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for construction. Here, the authors mention harvesting metadata from 86 repositories and archives.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the dataset consists of 9.17 million sentence pairs in 31 language pairs and is publicly available via the ELRC-SHARE repository.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For SciPar, the citation is:
  > Dimitris Roussis, Vassilis Papavassiliou, Prokopis Prokopidis, Stelios Piperidis, and Vassilis Katsouros. *SciPar: A Collection of Parallel Corpora from Scientific Abstracts*. In Proceedings of the 13th Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2022), pages 2652a2657, Marseille, 20-25 June 2022. https://doi.org/10.36001/lrec.2022.2652a2657

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
