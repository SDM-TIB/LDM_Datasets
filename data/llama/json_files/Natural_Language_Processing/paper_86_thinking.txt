To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Machine Translation with Byte-Level Subwords" by Changhan Wu, Kyunghyun Cho, and Jiatao Gu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for machine translation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of character-based vocabularies and the potential of byte-level subwords for machine translation. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three bilingual corpora:

1. **English-German (En-De)**: This dataset is used for bilingual machine translation.
2. **Japanese-English (Ja-En)**: This dataset is used for bilingual machine translation.
3. **Sinhala-English (Si-En)**: This dataset is used for bilingual machine translation.
4. **Many-to-English (X-En)**: This dataset is used for multilingual machine translation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **En-De**, the citation is:
  > Vaswani et al. (2017) use the WMT 2014 data for En-De.

- For **Ja-En**, the citation is:
  > Michel and Neu-big (2018) use the KFTT2, TED3, and JESC datasets for Ja-En.

- For **Si-En**, the citation is:
  > GuzmA an et al. (2019) use the FLoRes dataset for Si-En.

- For **X-En**, the citation is:
  > Ye et al. (2018) use the TED Talks corpus for X-En.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
