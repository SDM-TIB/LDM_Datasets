To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Better Conversations by Modeling, Filtering, and Optimizing for Coherence and Diversity" by Xinnuo Xu, OndErek DuEsek, Ioannis Konstas and Verena Rieser, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the OpenSubtitles corpus and the OpenSubtitles filtered corpus.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the OpenSubtitles corpus and its use for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the OpenSubtitles corpus and the OpenSubtitles filtered corpus.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **OpenSubtitles**, the citation is:
  > Pierre Lison and Raveesh Meena. 2016. Automatic Turn Segmentation for Movie & TV Subtitles. 2016 IEEE Workshop on Spoken Language Technology. IEEE conference proceedings.

- For **OpenSubtitles filtered corpus**, the citation is:
  > Pierre Lison and JA org Tiedemann. 2016. OpenSubtitles2016: Extracting Large Parallel Corpora from Movie and TV Subtitles. In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016), PortoroEz, Slovenia.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
