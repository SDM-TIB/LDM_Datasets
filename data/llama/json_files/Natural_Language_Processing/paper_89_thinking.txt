To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Cross-Domain System forMapping Arbitrary Phrases to a Taxonomy" by Rohollah Soltani and Alexandre Tomberg, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of SNOMED CT and ICD-9-CM, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing methods for mapping coding standards and the importance of developing a cross-domain mapping system. They hint at the use of various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SNOMED CT**: A large taxonomy of medical concepts.
2. **ICD-9-CM**: A coding system for diagnoses and procedures.
3. **MIMIC-III Clinical Database**: A database of clinical notes and discharge summaries.
4. **PubMed**: A database of biomedical literature.
5. **FAERS**: A database of adverse event reports.
6. **i2b2 2010 Relations Challenge**: A dataset of clinical text with annotated relations.
7. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: A dataset of annotated gene mentions.
8. **JNLPBA corpus**: A dataset of annotated proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
9. **CHEMDNER corpus**: A dataset of annotated drugs and chemicals.
10. **ICD-9-CM phrases**: A dataset of phrases mapped to ICD-9-CM concepts.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
