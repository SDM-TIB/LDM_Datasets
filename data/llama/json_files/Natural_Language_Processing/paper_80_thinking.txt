To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Machine Translation with Dependency-Aware Self-Attention" by Emanuele Bugliarello, Naoaki Okazaki, and others, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed PASCAL mechanism on various translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of neural machine translation models and the importance of incorporating syntactic knowledge. They hint at the evaluation of the proposed PASCAL mechanism on several datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **News Commentary v11 (NC11)**: This dataset is used for English-German and German-English translation tasks.
2. **WMT16 English-German (En-De)**: This dataset is used for English-German translation task.
3. **WMT17 English-German (En-De)**: This dataset is used for English-German translation task.
4. **WAT English-Japanese (En-Ja)**: This dataset is used for English-Japanese translation task.
5. **WAT18 English-Turkish (En-Tr)**: This dataset is used for English-Turkish translation task.
6. **WMT18 English-Turkish (En-Tr)**: This dataset is used for English-Turkish translation task.
7. **WMT16 English-De (De-En)**: This dataset is used for German-English translation task.
8. **WAT English-Japanese (En-Ja)**: This dataset is used for English-Japanese translation task.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **NC11**, the citation is:
  > Bastings et al. (2017)
- For **WMT16 En-De**, the citation is:
  > Wu et al. (2018)
- For **WMT17 En-De**, the citation is:
  > Currey and Heaield (2019)
- For **WAT En-Ja**, the citation is:
  > Hashimoto and Tsuruoka (2017)
- For **WAT18 En-Tr**, the citation is:
  > Saunders et al. (2018)
- For **WMT18 En-Tr**, the citation is:
  > Saunders et al. (2018)
- For **WMT16 De-En**, the citation is:
  > Wu et al. (2018)
- For **WAT En-Ja**, the citation is:
  > Hashimoto and Tsuruoka (2017)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
