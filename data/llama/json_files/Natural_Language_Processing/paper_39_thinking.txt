To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-tuning BERT for Joint Entity and Relation Extraction in Chinese Medical Text" by Kui Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of coronary angiography texts collected from Shuguang Hospital, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of entity and relation extraction in medical text and the limitations of existing models.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **coronary angiography texts** collected from Shuguang Hospital
2. **Negation, Hospital** dataset
3. **Body Part, Degree, Quantiier and Location** dataset
4. **Negation, Hospital** dataset
5. **Negation, Hospital** dataset
6. **Negation, Hospital** dataset
7. **Negation, Hospital** dataset
8. **Negation, Hospital** dataset
9. **Negation, Hospital** dataset
10. **Negation, Hospital** dataset

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **coronary angiography texts**, the citation is:
  > Kui Xue, Yangming Zhou, Zhiyuan Ma, Tong Ruan, Huanhuan Zhang, and Ping He. Fine-tuning BERT for Joint Entity and Relation Extraction in Chinese Medical Text. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.09623, 2021.

- For **Negation, Hospital** dataset, the citation is:
  > Kui Xue, Yangming Zhou, Zhiyuan Ma, Tong Ruan, Huanhuan Zhang, and Ping He. Fine-tuning BERT for Joint Entity and Relation Extraction in Chinese Medical Text. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.09623, 2021.

- For **Body Part, Degree, Quantiier and Location** dataset, the citation is:
  > Kui Xue, Yangming Zhou, Zhiyuan Ma, Tong Ruan, Huanhuan Zhang, and Ping He. Fine-tuning BERT for Joint Entity and Relation Extraction in Chinese Medical Text. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.09623, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
