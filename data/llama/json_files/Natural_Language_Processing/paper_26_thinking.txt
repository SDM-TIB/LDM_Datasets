To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Perspective Inferrer: Reasoning Sentences Relationship from Holistic Perspective" by Zhen Cheng, Zaixiang Zheng, Xin-Yu Dai, Shujian Huang, and Jiajun Chen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the NLI task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of alignment-based NLI models and the importance of multi-perspective inference. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **SNLI**: A dataset for natural language inference.
2. **MultiNLI**: A dataset for multi-genre natural language inference.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SNLI**, the citation is:
  > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. 2015. A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference. In EMNLP.

- For **MultiNLI**, the citation is:
  > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel R. Bowman. 2018. A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference. In NAACL-HLT.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
