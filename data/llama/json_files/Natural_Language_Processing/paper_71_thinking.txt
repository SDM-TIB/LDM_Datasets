To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Train, Sort, Explain: Learning to Diagnose Translation Models" by Robert Schwarzenberg et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of translation models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the evaluation of translation models and the need for diagnostic tools. They hint at the use of a dataset translated by a state-of-the-art neural Transformer model.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention a dataset translated by a state-of-the-art neural Transformer model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that this dataset was used for evaluation of their model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for this dataset:

- For the dataset, the citation is:
  > Vaswani et al. (2017) for their attention-only Transformer model, which still is state of the art in machine translation (MT) (Bojar et al., 2018). Furthermore, while MT output approaches human translation quality and the claims for a human paritya (Wu et al., 2016; Hassan et al., 2018) increase, multi-dimensionaldiagnostic evaluations can be useful to spot the thin line between the machine and the human.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
