To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structured Pruning of BERT-based Question Answering Models" by J.S. McCarley and Rishav Chakravarti and Avirup Sil, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the BERT-based question answering systems, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of SQuAD 2.0 and Natural Questions datasets for question answering tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **SQuAD 2.0**: A dataset of questions from Wikipedia passages.
2. **Natural Questions (NQ)**: A dataset of Google search queries with answers from Wikipedia pages.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SQuAD 2.0**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Robin Jia, and Percy Liang. *Know what you don't know: Unanswerable questions for SQuAD.*
  > In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers), pages 784-789, Melbourne, Australia. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **Natural Questions (NQ)**, the citation is:
  > Tom Kwiatkowski, Jennimaria Palomaki, Olivia Redield, Michael Collins, Ankur Parikh, Chris Alberti, Danielle Epstein, Illia Polosukhin, Matthew Kelcey, Jacob Devlin, Kenton Lee, Kristina N. Toutanova, Llion Jones, Ming-Wei Chang, Andrew Dai, Jakob Uszkoreit, Quoc Le, and Slav Petrov. *Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research.*
  > Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
