To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Token-Level Ensemble Distillation for Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion" by Hao Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of CMU-Dict and an internal dataset for G2P conversion, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of G2P conversion and the limitations of previous works. They also mention the use of CMU-Dict and an internal dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **CMU-Dict**: This dataset is used for G2P conversion.
2. **Internal dataset**: This dataset is also used for G2P conversion.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CMU-Dict**, the citation is:
  > K. Yao and G. Zweig, "Sequence-to-sequence neural network models for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion," in Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2015.

- For **Internal dataset**, the citation is:
  > Not found in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
