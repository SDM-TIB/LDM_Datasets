To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Humpty Dumpty: Controlling Word Meanings via Corpus Poisoning" by Roei Schuster, Tal Schuster, Yoav Meria, and Vitaly Shmatikov, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the English language, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of word embeddings and the importance of controlling word meanings via corpus poisoning. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Wikipedia**: A large public corpus used for training word embeddings.
2. **Twitter**: A social media platform used for training word embeddings.
3. **Sub-Wikipedia**: A smaller subset of Wikipedia used for training word embeddings.
4. **Common Crawl**: A large corpus of web pages used for training word embeddings.
5. **MUSE**: A dictionary of English words with Spanish, German, and Italian translations.
6. **WNUT 2017**: A dataset for named entity recognition.
7. **Spritzer Twitter stream archive**: A dataset of tweets used for named entity recognition.
8. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: A dataset for gene recognition tasks.
9. **JNLPBA corpus**: A dataset for annotating proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
10. **CHEMDNER corpus**: A dataset for annotating drugs and chemicals.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Wikipedia**, the citation is:
  > Pennington et al. (2014) GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation.

- For **Twitter**, the citation is:
  > Diaz et al. (2016) Query expansion with locally-similar word embeddings.

- For **Sub-Wikipedia**, the citation is:
  > Vosoughi et al. (2018) The spread of true and false news online.

- For **Common Crawl**, the citation is:
  > Ginter et al. (2017) CoNLL2017 shared task - automatically annotated raw texts and word embeddings.

- For **MUSE**, the citation is:
  > Conneau et al. (2018) Word translation without parallel data.

- For **WNUT 2017**, the citation is:
  > Akbik et al. (2018) Contextual string embeddings for sequence labeling.

- For **Spritzer Twitter stream archive**, the citation is:
  > Cherry and Guo (2015) The unreasonable effectiveness of word representations for Twitter named entity recognition.

- For **BC2GM**, the citation is:
  > Smith et al. (2008) Overview of biocreative ii gene mention recognition.

- For **JNLPBA**, the citation is:
  > Kim et al. (2004) Introduction to the bio-entity recognition task at JNLPBA.

- For **CHEMDNER**, the citation is:
  > Krallinger et al. (2015) CHEMDNER: The drugs and chemical names extraction challenge.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
