To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DLGNet: A Transformer-based Model for Dialogue Response Generation" by Oluwatobi O. Olabiyi and Erik T. Mueller, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of DLGNet models on the Movie Triples and Ubuntu Dialogue datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing dialogue models and the potential of transformer-based models for dialogue response generation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Movie Triples dataset**: This dataset is used for open-domain dialogue modeling.
2. **Ubuntu Dialogue dataset**: This dataset is used for closed-domain dialogue modeling.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of DLGNet models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Movie Triples dataset**, the citation is:
  > Serban, I. V.; Sordoni, A.; Bengio, Y.; Courville, A.; and Pineau, J. 2016. Building end-to-end dialogue systems using generative hierarchical neural network models. In Proceedings of The Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artiicial Intelligence (AAAI 2016), 3776a3784.

- For **Ubuntu Dialogue dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lowe, R.; Pow, N.; Serban, I.; and Pineau, J. 2015. The ubuntu dialogue corpus: A large dataset for research in unstructured multi-turn dialogue systems. In SIG-DIAL.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
