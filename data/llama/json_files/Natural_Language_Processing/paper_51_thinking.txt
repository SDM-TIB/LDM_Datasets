To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Learning with Contextual Embeddings for Zero-resource Cross-lingual Classification and NER" by Phillip Keung, Yichao Lu, Vikas Bhardwaj, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of multilingual BERT and MLDoc corpus for cross-lingual classification and NER tasks.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of multilingual BERT and the MLDoc corpus for cross-lingual classification and NER tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MLDoc corpus**: A multilingual document classification corpus.
2. **CoNLL 2002/2003 NER corpus**: A named entity recognition corpus.
3. **XNLI dataset**: A cross-lingual natural language inference dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MLDoc corpus**, the citation is:
  > Schwenk and Li (2018) use the multilingual version of BERT on the MLDoc corpus for multilingual document classification.

- For **CoNLL 2002/2003 NER corpus**, the citation is:
  > Sang and De Meulder (2003) introduce the CoNLL 2002/2003 NER corpus.

- For **XNLI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Conneau et al. (2018) introduce the XNLI dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
