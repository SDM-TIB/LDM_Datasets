To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-Training with Whole Word Masking for Chinese BERT" by Yiming Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the Chinese language, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing pre-trained language models and the importance of adapting them to the Chinese language. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention several named entity recognition corpora:

1. **CMRC 2018**: A span-extraction machine reading comprehension dataset.
2. **DRCD**: A span-extraction dataset in Traditional Chinese.
3. **CJRC**: A span-extraction dataset in Chinese law judgment documents.
4. **ChnSentiCorp**: A sentiment classification dataset.
5. **THUCNews**: A news classification dataset.
6. **TNEWS**: A short text classification dataset.
7. **XNLI**: A sentence pair classification dataset.
8. **LCQMC**: A sentence pair classification dataset.
9. **BQ Corpus**: A sentence pair classification dataset.
10. **OCNLI**: A sentence pair classification dataset.
11. **SIGHAN-15**: A Chinese spelling check dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
