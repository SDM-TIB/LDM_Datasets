    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Patent landscaping" by Seokkyu Cho, Hyeonju Lee, Eunjeong Park, Sungchul Cho, and others, I will follow a systematic approach.

    First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the proposal of an automated patent landscaping model based on deep learning, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

    In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing patent landscaping methods and the need for automated patent landscaping, but I need to look for specific names.

    Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for benchmarking. Here, the authors mention four named datasets:

    1. **KISTA datasets for patent landscaping**: This dataset is used for benchmarking the proposed model.
    2. **MPUART dataset**: This dataset is used for benchmarking the proposed model.
    3. **MWDFS dataset**: This dataset is used for benchmarking the proposed model.
    4. **MRRG dataset**: This dataset is used for benchmarking the proposed model.
    5. **GOCS dataset**: This dataset is used for benchmarking the proposed model.

    In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

    Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

    - For **KISTA datasets for patent landscaping**, the citation is:
      > Seokkyu Cho, Hyeonju Lee, Eunjeong Park, Sungchul Cho, and others. *Patent landscaping*. Journal, 2019.

    - For **MPUART dataset**, the citation is:
      > Seokkyu Cho, Hyeonju Lee, Eunjeong Park, Sungchul Cho, and others. *Patent landscaping*. Journal, 2019.

    - For **MWDFS dataset**, the citation is:
      > Seokkyu Cho, Hyeonju Lee, Eunjeong Park, Sungchul Cho, and others. *Patent landscaping*. Journal, 2019.

    - For **MRRG dataset**, the citation is:
      > Seokkyu Cho, Hyeonju Lee, Eunjeong Park, Sungchul Cho, and others. *Patent landscaping*. Journal, 2019.

    - For **GOCS dataset**, the citation is:
      > Seokkyu Cho, Hyeonju Lee, Eunjeong Park, Sungchul Cho, and others. *Patent landscaping*. Journal, 2019.

    After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
