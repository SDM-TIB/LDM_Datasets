To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ATTENTIONAL SPEECH RECOGNITION MODELS MISBEHAVE ON OUT-OF-DOMAIN UTTERANCES" by Phillip Keung, Wei Niu, Yichao Lu, Julian Salazar, and Vikas Bhardwaj, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the British National Corpus (BNC) and the LibriSpeech corpus.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the problem of echographic transcription in automatic speech recognition and mention the use of the LibriSpeech corpus for training and testing.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **British National Corpus (BNC)**: This dataset is used for out-of-domain testing.
2. **LibriSpeech corpus**: This dataset is used for training and testing.
3. **LibriSpeech dev-clean**: This dataset is used for evaluation.
4. **LibriSpeech test-clean**: This dataset is used for evaluation.
5. **LibriSpeech test-other**: This dataset is used for evaluation.
6. **Switchboard**: This dataset is mentioned as a comparison dataset.
7. **Google Voice Search**: This dataset is mentioned as a comparison dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **BNC**, the citation is:
  > John Coleman, Ladan Baghai-Ravary, John Pybus, and Sergio Grau, *Audio bnc: the audio edition of the spoken british national corpus*, Phonetics Laboratory, University of Oxford, 2012.

- For **LibriSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur, *Librispeech: an asr corpus based on public domain audio books*, ICASSP, 2015.

- For **LibriSpeech dev-clean**, the citation is:
  > Chung-Cheng Chiu, Tara N Sainath, Yonghui Wu, Rohit Prabhavalkar, Patrick Nguyen, Zhifeng Chen, Anjuli Kannan, Ron J Weiss, Kanishka Rao, Ekaterina Gonina, et al., *State-of-the-art speech recognition with sequence-to-sequence models*, ICASSP, 2018.

- For **LibriSpeech test-clean**, the citation is:
  > Chung-Cheng Chiu, Tara N Sainath, Yonghui Wu, Rohit Prabhavalkar, Patrick Nguyen, Zhifeng Chen, Anjuli Kannan, Ron J Weiss, Kanishka Rao, Ekaterina Gonina, et al., *State-of-the-art speech recognition with sequence-to-sequence models*, ICASSP, 2018.

- For **LibriSpeech test-other**, the citation is:
  > Chung-Cheng Chiu, Tara N Sainath, Yonghui Wu, Rohit Prabhavalkar, Patrick Nguyen, Zhifeng Chen, Anjuli Kannan, Ron J Weiss, Kanishka Rao, Ekaterina Gonina, et al., *State-of-the-art speech recognition with sequence-to-sequence models*, ICASSP, 2018.

- For **Switchboard**, the citation is:
  > William Chan, Navdeep Jaitly, Quoc Le, and Oriol Vinyals, *Listen, attend and spell: A neural network for large vocabulary conversational speech recognition*, ICASSP, 2016.

- For **Google Voice Search**, the citation is:
  > Albert Zeyer, Kazuki Irie, Ralf SchlA uter, and Hermann Ney, *Improved training of end-to-end attention models for speech recognition*, Interspeech, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
