To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Simple but Effective Method to Incorporate Multi-turn Context with BERT for Conversational Machine Comprehension" by Yasuhito Ohsugi, Hisako Asano, Itsumi Saito, and Kyosuke Nishida, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the QuAC and CoQA datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the QuAC and CoQA datasets, which are used for conversational machine comprehension tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the QuAC and CoQA datasets.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **QuAC**, the citation is:
  > Eunsol Choi, He He, Mohit Iyyer, Mark Yatskar, Wen-tau Yih, Yejin Choi, Percy Liang, and Luke Zettle-moyer. 2018. Quac: Question answering in context. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages2174a2184. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **CoQA**, the citation is:
  > Siva Reddy, Danqi Chen, and Christopher D. Manning.2018. Coqa: A conversational question answering challenge. CoRR, abs/1808.07042.
