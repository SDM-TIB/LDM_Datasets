To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QE BERT: Bilingual BERT using Multi-task Learning for Neural Quality Estimation" by Hyun Kim and Joon-Ho Lim and Hyun-Ki Kim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of parallel data to pre-train BERT, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of translation quality estimation and mention the use of QE data for training.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for pre-training and fine-tuning. Here, the authors mention the use of parallel data for pre-training and QE data for fine-tuning.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the QE BERT model was trained on the QE data and evaluated on the WMT19 QE dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the QE BERT model, the citation is:
  > Hyun Kim, Joon-Ho Lim, and Hyun-Ki Kim. *QE BERT: Bilingual BERT using Multi-task Learning for Neural Quality Estimation*. In Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT), Volume 3: Shared Task Papers, pages 85a89, Florence, Italy, August 1-2, 2019.

- For the WMT19 QE dataset, the citation is:
  > WMT19 QE Shared Task. *WMT19 QE Shared Task*. https://www.statmt.org/wmt19/qe-task.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
