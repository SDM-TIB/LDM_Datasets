To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Local Neighboring Structure for Robust 3D Shape Representation" by Zhongpai Gao, Junchi Yan, Guangtao Zhai, Juyong Zhang, Yiyan Yang, and Xiaokang Yang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for 3D shapes, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous methods for 3D shape representation learning and the importance of adapting insight from CNNs for 3D shapes. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **COMA (Convolutional Mesh Autoencoder)**: This dataset is used for 3D shape reconstruction tasks.
2. **DFAUST (Deformable Face Alignment Using Surface Tracking)**: This dataset is used for 3D face alignment and reconstruction tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **COMA**, the citation is:
  > Ranjan, A.; Bolkart, T.; Sanyal, S.; and Black, M. J. *Generating 3D Faces using Convolutional Mesh Autoencoders*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2018.

- For **DFAUST**, the citation is:
  > Bogo, F.; Romero, J.; Loper, M.; and Black, M. J. *Dynamic FAUST: Registering Human Bodies in Motion*. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
