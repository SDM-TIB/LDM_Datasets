To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The MLLP-UPV Spanish-Portuguese and Portuguese-Spanish MachineTranslation Systems for WMT19 Similar Language Translation Task" by Pau Baquero-Arnal, Javier Iranzo-SA anchez, Jorge Civera, Alfons Juan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the participation of the MLLP research group in the WMT 2019Similar Language Translation Shared Task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors describe the training corpora used for the baseline systems, which includes the JCR, Europarl, news-commentary, and wikititles corpora.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **JCR**: A corpus used for training the baseline systems.
2. **Europarl**: A corpus used for training the baseline systems.
3. **News-commentary**: A corpus used for training the baseline systems.
4. **Wikititles**: A corpus used for training the baseline systems.
5. **Portuguese-Spanish**: A language pair used for the translation task.
6. **Spanish-Portuguese**: A language pair used for the translation task.

In the **results section**, the authors report the results of the ine-tuning technique, which is applied to the Transformer and 2D alternating RNN models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **JCR**, the citation is:
  > Table 1 shows the number of sentences, number of words and vocabulary size of each corpus.

- For **Europarl**, the citation is:
  > Table 1 shows the number of sentences, number of words and vocabulary size of each corpus.

- For **News-commentary**, the citation is:
  > Table 1 shows the number of sentences, number of words and vocabulary size of each corpus.

- For **Wikititles**, the citation is:
  > Table 1 shows the number of sentences, number of words and vocabulary size of each corpus.

- For **Portuguese-Spanish**, the citation is:
  > Table 2 shows the evaluation results for the Portuguese-Spanish task.

- For **Spanish-Portuguese**, the citation is:
  > Table 3 shows the evaluation results for the Spanish-Portuguese task.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
