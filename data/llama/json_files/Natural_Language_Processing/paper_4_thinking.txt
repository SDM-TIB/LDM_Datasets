To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TMU Transformer System Using BERT for Re-ranking at BEA 2019" by Masahiro Kaneko, Kengo Hotate, Satoru Katsumata, and Mamoru Komachi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the BEA 2019 shared task on grammatical error correction, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of selecting an appropriate hypothesis sentence from the candidates list generated by the GEC model. They mention the use of the W&I+LOCNESS development dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **W&I+LOCNESS dataset**: This dataset is used for the development and test sets.
2. **FCE (First Certificate in English) corpus**: This corpus is used for the development and test sets.
3. **Lang-8 learner corpus**: This corpus is used for the development and test sets.
4. **NUCLE (National University of Singapore Corpus of Learner English) corpus**: This corpus is used for the development and test sets.
5. **W&I (Write & Improve) corpus**: This corpus is used for the development and test sets.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **W&I+LOCNESS**, the citation is:
  > Yan-nakoudakis et al. (2018) developed the W&I+LOCNESS corpus.

- For **FCE**, the citation is:
  > Yannakoudakis et al. (2011) developed the FCE corpus.

- For **Lang-8**, the citation is:
  > Mizumoto et al. (2011) developed the Lang-8 corpus.

- For **NUCLE**, the citation is:
  > Ng et al. (2013) developed the NUCLE corpus.

- For **W&I**, the citation is:
  > Yannakoudakis et al. (2018) developed the W&I corpus.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
