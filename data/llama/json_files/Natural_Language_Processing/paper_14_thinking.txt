To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting BERT for End-to-End Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis" by Xin Li, Lidong Bing, Wenxuan Zhang, and Wai Lam, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the E2E-ABSA task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing ABSA models and the importance of using contextualized embeddings for E2E-ABSA. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **LAPTOP**: A dataset used for E2E-ABSA evaluation.
2. **REST**: A dataset used for E2E-ABSA evaluation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LAPTOP**, the citation is:
  > Table 2: Main results. The symbol denotes the numbers are oficially reported ones. The results with are retrieved from Li et al. (2019a).

- For **REST**, the citation is:
  > Table 2: Main results. The symbol denotes the numbers are oficially reported ones. The results with are retrieved from Li et al. (2019a).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
