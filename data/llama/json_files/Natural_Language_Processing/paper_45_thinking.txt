To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating BERT Inference via Progressive Word-vector Elimination" by Saurabh Goyal, Anamitra R. Choudhury, Saurabh M. Raje, Venkatesan T. Chakaravarthy, Yogish Sabharwal, and Ashish Verma, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the BERT model, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of the BERT model and the importance of improving inference time. They hint at the evaluation of the model on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **GLUE benchmark**: This dataset is used for evaluating the BERT model on various natural language understanding tasks.
2. **SST-2**: This dataset is used for evaluating the BERT model on sentiment analysis tasks.
3. **MNLI**: This dataset is used for evaluating the BERT model on natural language inference tasks.
4. **QQP**: This dataset is used for evaluating the BERT model on question answering tasks.
5. **MRPC**: This dataset is used for evaluating the BERT model on machine reading comprehension tasks.
6. **STS-B**: This dataset is used for evaluating the BERT model on semantic similarity tasks.
7. **IMDB**: This dataset is used for evaluating the BERT model on sentiment analysis tasks.
8. **RACE**: This dataset is used for evaluating the BERT model on reading comprehension tasks.
9. **ALBERT**: This dataset is used for evaluating the BERT model on various tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **GLUE benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Wang et al. [2019a]

- For **SST-2**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar et al. [2016]

- For **MNLI**, the citation is:
  > Narasimhan et al. [2019]

- For **QQP**, the citation is:
  > Devlin et al. [2019]

- For **MRPC**, the citation is:
  > Du et al. [2019]

- For **STS-B**, the citation is:
  > Cer et al. [2017]

- For **IMDB**, the citation is:
  > Maas et al. [2011]

- For **RACE**, the citation is:
  > Lai et al. [2017]

- For **ALBERT**, the citation is:
  > Lan et al. [2019]

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
