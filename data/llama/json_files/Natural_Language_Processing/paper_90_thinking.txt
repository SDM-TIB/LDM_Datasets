To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transforming Delete, Retrieve, Generate Approach for Controlled TextStyle Transfer" by Akhilesh Sudhakar, Bhargav Upadhyay, and Arjun Maheswaran, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various datasets for sentiment, gender, and political slant transfer tasks.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous approaches and the importance of using controlled style transfer.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **YELP**: A dataset for sentiment transfer tasks.
2. **AMAZON**: A dataset for sentiment transfer tasks.
3. **CAPTIONS**: A dataset for sentiment transfer tasks.
4. **POLITICAL**: A dataset for political slant transfer tasks.
5. **GENDER**: A dataset for gender transfer tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **YELP**, the citation is:
  > Li et al. (2018) use the Yelp dataset for sentiment transfer tasks.

- For **AMAZON**, the citation is:
  > Li et al. (2018) use the Amazon dataset for sentiment transfer tasks.

- For **CAPTIONS**, the citation is:
  > Li et al. (2018) use the Captions dataset for sentiment transfer tasks.

- For **POLITICAL**, the citation is:
  > Prabhumoye et al. (2018) use the Political dataset for political slant transfer tasks.

- For **GENDER**, the citation is:
  > Prabhumoye et al. (2018) use the Gender dataset for gender transfer tasks.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
