To extract datasets from the research paper titled "E-BERT: Eficient-Yet-Effective Entity Embeddings for BERT" by Nina Poernera, Ulli Waltinger, and Hinrich SchÃ¼tze, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of E-BERT on unsupervised question answering (QA), supervised relation classification (RC), and entity linking (EL) tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of BERT and the importance of injecting factual knowledge about entities into the model. They hint at the evaluation of E-BERT on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **LAMA (LAnguage Model Analysis) dataset**: This dataset is used for unsupervised QA evaluation.
2. **FewRel corpus**: This dataset is used for relation classification (RC) evaluation.
3. **AIDA dataset**: This dataset is used for entity linking (EL) evaluation.
4. **Wikipedia2Vec**: This dataset is used for entity vector alignment.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of E-BERT, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LAMA**, the citation is:
  > Petroni et al. (2019) claim that BERT as performance on LAMA is comparable with a knowledge base (KB) automatically extracted from text, and speculate that BERT and similar models might become a viable alternative to such KBs.

- For **FewRel**, the citation is:
  > Das et al. (2017) use the FewRel corpus for relation classification.

- For **AIDA**, the citation is:
  > Broscheit (2019) uses the AIDA dataset for entity linking.

- For **Wikipedia2Vec**, the citation is:
  > Yamada et al. (2016) embed words and entities into a common space using Wikipedia2Vec.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
