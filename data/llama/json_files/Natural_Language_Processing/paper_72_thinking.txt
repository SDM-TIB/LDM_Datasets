To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Literary Event Detection" by Matthew Sims, Jong Ho Park, and David Bamman, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the presentation of a new dataset of literary events, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of event detection in literature and the need for a new dataset. They hint at the creation of a new annotated dataset of literary events.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the dataset used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named dataset:

1. **LitBank**: This dataset is a new annotated dataset of literary events.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the LitBank dataset was used for evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the LitBank dataset:

- For **LitBank**, the citation is:
  > David Bamman, Sejal Popat, and Sheng Shen. Annotated dataset of literary entities. NAACL.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
