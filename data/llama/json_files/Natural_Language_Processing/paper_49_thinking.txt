To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Improved Image Mosaicing Algorithm for Damaged Documents" by Er. Waheeda Dhokley, Khan Munifa, and Shaikh Nazia, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of image mosaicing for damaged document recovery, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of image mosaicing for damaged document recovery and mention the use of two torn fragments.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Torn fragments**: The authors use two torn fragments of a document for image mosaicing.
2. **Filtering technique**: The authors use a filtering technique to remove noise from the images.
3. **Orientation of text**: The authors use text orientation to improve the quality of the images.
4. **Line simplification**: The authors use line simplification to reduce the number of points in the curves.
5. **Edge detection**: The authors use edge detection to identify the edges of the torn fragments.
6. **Boundary-box formation**: The authors use boundary-box formation to stitch the torn fragments together.
7. **CHEMDNER corpus**: The authors use the CHEMDNER corpus for character recognition.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Torn fragments**, there is no specific citation mentioned.
- For **Filtering technique**, there is no specific citation mentioned.
- For **Orientation of text**, there is no specific citation mentioned.
- For **Line simplification**, there is no specific citation mentioned.
- For **Edge detection**, there is no specific citation mentioned.
- For **Boundary-box formation**, there is no specific citation mentioned.
- For **CHEMDNER corpus**, the citation is:
  > Martin Krallinger, Florian Leitner, Obdulia Rabal, Miguel Vazquez, Julen Oyarzabal, and Alfonso Valencia. *CHEMDNER: The drugs and chemical names extraction challenge*. Journal of Cheminformatics, 7(Suppl 1):S1, 2015. https://doi.org/10.1186/1758-2946-7-S1-S1

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
