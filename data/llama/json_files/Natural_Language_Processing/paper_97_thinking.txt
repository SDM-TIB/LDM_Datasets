To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Domain Adaptation with BERT-based Domain Classification and Data Selection" by Xiaofei Ma, Peng Xu, Zhiguo Wang, Ramesh Nallapati, and Bing Xiang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the domain adaptation task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of fine-tuning deep neural networks for domain adaptation and the importance of domain-discriminative data selection. They hint at the evaluation of their method on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention four large public datasets:

1. **SNLI**: The Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus.
2. **MNLI**: The Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI) corpus.
3. **QNLI**: The Question-answering Natural Language Inference (QNLI) dataset.
4. **Quora**: The Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their method, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SNLI**, the citation is:
  > Bowman et al. (2015) presents the SNLI corpus.

- For **MNLI**, the citation is:
  > Williams et al. (2017) presents the MNLI corpus.

- For **QNLI**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar et al. (2016) presents the QNLI dataset.

- For **Quora**, the citation is:
  > Wanget al. (2017) presents the QQP dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
