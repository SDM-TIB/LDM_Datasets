To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TENER: Adapting Transformer Encoder for Named Entity Recognition" by Hang Yan, Bocao Deng, Xiaonan Li, Xipeng Qiu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed model on six NER datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of vanilla Transformer in NER tasks and propose the use of relative positional encoding and unscaled attention.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following NER datasets:

1. **EnglishCoNLL2003**
2. **OntoNotes 5.0**
3. **ChineseMSRAWeibo**
4. **ChineseResume**
5. **ChineseOntoNotes 4.0**
6. **ChineseWeibo**

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **EnglishCoNLL2003**, the citation is:
  > Erik F. Tjong Kim Sang and Fien De Meulder. 2003. Introduction to the conll-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition. In Proceedings of the 2003 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142-147, 2003.

- For **OntoNotes 5.0**, the citation is:
  > Ronan Collobert, Jason Weston, LA eon Bottou, Michael Karlen, Koray Kavukcuoglu, and Pavel Kuksa. 2011. Natural language processing (almost) from scratch. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 12(August):2493-2537.

- For **ChineseMSRAWeibo**, the citation is:
  > Peng and Dredze. 2015. Named entity recognition for chinese social media with jointly trained embeddings. In EMNLP, pages 548-554.

- For **ChineseResume**, the citation is:
  > Zhang and Yang. 2018. Chinese NER using lattice LSTM. In ACL, pages 1554-1564.

- For **ChineseOntoNotes 4.0**, the citation is:
  > Weischedel. 2011. Ontonotes release 4.0. LDC2011T03.

- For **ChineseWeibo**, the citation is:
  > Peng and Dredze. 2015. Named entity recognition for chinese social media with jointly trained embeddings. In EMNLP, pages 548-554.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
