To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extroitting: Enriching Word Representation and its Vector Space with Semantic Lexicons" by Hwiyeol Jo and Stanley Jungkyu Choi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for word similarity tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of word representation and the importance of enriching word vectors using semantic lexicons. They hint at the evaluation of their method on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named datasets:

1. **MEN-3k**: A dataset for word similarity tasks.
2. **WordSim-353**: A dataset for word similarity tasks.
3. **SimLex-999**: A dataset for word similarity tasks.
4. **RG-65**: A dataset for word similarity tasks.
5. **PPDB**: A dataset for word similarity tasks.
6. **WordNetsyn**: A dataset for word similarity tasks.
7. **WordNetall**: A dataset for word similarity tasks.
8. **FrameNet**: A dataset for word similarity tasks.
9. **Glove.6B**: A pre-trained word vector dataset.
10. **Glove.42B.300d**: A pre-trained word vector dataset.
11. **Word2Vec**: A pre-trained word vector dataset.
12. **Fasttext**: A pre-trained word vector dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their method, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
