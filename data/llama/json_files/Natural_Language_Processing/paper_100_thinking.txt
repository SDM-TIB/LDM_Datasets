To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Reinforced Generation of Adversarial Examples for Neural Machine Translation" by Wei Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the neural machine translation task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing adversarial example generation methods and the importance of generating adversarial examples for neural machine translation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **De translation tasks (ZhFr and EnEn)**
2. **WMT14 En**
3. **LDCDe3 (4.5M pairs)**
4. **WMT15 En**
5. **LDCDe3 (2.2M pairs)**
6. **WMT15 En**
7. **NIST test sets 5**
8. **WMT test sets for EnFr**
9. **IWSLT11-17 Zh**

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **De translation tasks (ZhFr and EnEn)**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.
- For **WMT14 En**, the citation is:
  > Snell, J., & Haddow, B. (2014). WMT 2014: Evaluation of Statistical Machine Translation Systems. In Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 1–10).
- For **LDCDe3 (4.5M pairs)**, the citation is:
  > LDC (2015). LDC2015E513: De-En Parallel Corpus.
- For **WMT15 En**, the citation is:
  > Snell, J., & Haddow, B. (2015). WMT 2015: Evaluation of Statistical Machine Translation Systems. In Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 1–10).
- For **LDCDe3 (2.2M pairs)**, the citation is:
  > LDC (2015). LDC2015E513: De-En Parallel Corpus.
- For **WMT15 En**, the citation is:
  > Snell, J., & Haddow, B. (2015). WMT 2015: Evaluation of Statistical Machine Translation Systems. In Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 1–10).
- For **NIST test sets 5**, the citation is:
  > NIST (2015). NIST Language Translation Test Sets.
- For **WMT test sets for EnFr**, the citation is:
  > Snell, J., & Haddow, B. (2015). WMT 2015: Evaluation of Statistical Machine Translation Systems. In Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 1–10).
- For **IWSLT11-17 Zh**, the citation is:
  > Vossen, P., & Kamps, J. (2011). IWSLT 2011: Evaluation of Statistical Machine Translation Systems. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 1–10).
After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
