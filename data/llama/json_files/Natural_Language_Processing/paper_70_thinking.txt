To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal Dependencies According to BERT: Both More Specific and More General" by Tomasz Limisiewicz and Rudolf Rosa and David MareEcek, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the analysis of the form and extent of syntactic abstraction captured by BERT by extracting labeled dependency trees from self-attentions.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the comparison of BERT relations to Universal Dependencies (UD) annotations, showing that they often do not match one-to-one.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **EuroParl**: A multilingual parallel corpus used for head selection.
2. **UDPipe UD 2.0 models**: Used for annotating UD trees.
3. **Google Universal Dependency Treebanks**: Used for annotating UD trees.
4. **UD Turkish Treebank**: Used for annotating UD trees.
5. **CoNLL2017 Shared Task**: Used for evaluating mBERT.
6. **Universal Dependencies (UD)**: Used for modifying UD annotations.
7. **Surface-syntactic UD (SUD)**: Used for comparison with BERT syntax.
8. **Parallel Universal Dependencies**: Used for multilingual evaluation.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **EuroParl**, the citation is:
  > Philipp Koehn. 2004. Europarl: A parallel corpus for statistical machine translation. 5.

- For **UDPipe UD 2.0 models**, the citation is:
  > Milan Straka and Jana Straková. 2017. Tokenizing, POS tagging, lemmatizing and parsing UD 2.0 with UDpipe.

- For **Google Universal Dependency Treebanks**, the citation is:
  > Ryan McDonald, Joakim Nivre, Yvonne Quirmbach-Brundage, Yoav Goldberg, Dipanjan Das, Kuzman Ganchev, Keith Hall, Slav Petrov, Hao Zhang, Oscar Tackström, Claudia Bedini, Nora Berta, and others. 2013. Universal dependencies 2.0: A CoNLL2017 shared task development and test data.

- For **UD Turkish Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Umut Sulubacak, Gulsah Eryiğit, and Tuğba Pamu. 2016. Imst: A revisited Turkish dependency treebank.

- For **CoNLL2017 Shared Task**, the citation is:
  > Joakim Nivre, EZeljko Agić, Lars Ahrenberg, Lene Antonsen, Maria Jesus Aranzabe, Masayuki Asahara, Luma Ateyah, Mohammed Attia, Aitziber Atutxa, Elena Badmaeva, and others. 2017. Universal dependencies 2.0: A CoNLL2017 shared task development and test data.

- For **Universal Dependencies (UD)**, the citation is:

- For **Surface-syntactic UD (SUD)**, the citation is:
  > Kim Gerdes, Bruno Guillaume, Sylvain Kahane, and Guy Perrier. 2018. SUD or Surface-syntactic Universal Dependencies: An annotation scheme near-isomorphic to UD.

- For **Parallel Universal Dependencies**, the citation is:
  > Telmo Pires, Eva Schlinger, and Dan Garrette. 2019. How multilingual is multilingual BERT? In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 4996–5001.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
