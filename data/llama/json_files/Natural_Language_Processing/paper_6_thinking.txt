To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uniied Language Model Pre-training for Natural Language Understanding and Generation" by Li Donga Nan Yanga Wenhui Wanga Furu Weia a Xiaodong Liu Yu WangJianfeng Gao Ming Zhou Hsiao-Wuen HonMicrosoft Research, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the natural language understanding and generation tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of different language models and the importance of pre-training a unified model for both natural language understanding and generation tasks. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CNN/DailyMail**: A dataset for abstractive summarization.
2. **Gigaword**: A dataset for abstractive summarization.
3. **SQuAD 2.0**: A dataset for extractive question answering.
4. **CoQA**: A dataset for extractive question answering and generative question answering.
5. **DSTC7**: A dataset for document-grounded dialog response generation.
6. **GLUE benchmark**: A dataset for natural language understanding tasks.
7. **BookCorpus**: A dataset used for pre-training the unified language model.
8. **English Wikipedia**: A dataset used for pre-training the unified language model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CNN/DailyMail**, the citation is:
  > [37]

- For **Gigaword**, the citation is:
  > [36]

- For **SQuAD 2.0**, the citation is:
  > [34]

- For **CoQA**, the citation is:
  > [35]

- For **DSTC7**, the citation is:
  > [30]

- For **GLUE benchmark**, the citation is:
  > [45]

- For **BookCorpus**, the citation is:
  > [53]

- For **English Wikipedia**, the citation is:
  > [48]

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
