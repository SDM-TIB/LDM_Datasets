To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PAWS-X: A Cross-lingual Adversarial Dataset for ParaphraseIdentification" by Yinfei Yang, Yuan Zhang, Chris Tar, and Jason Baldridge, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the creation of a new dataset for paraphrase identification, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets for paraphrase identification and the need for a new dataset that covers multiple languages.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named datasets:

1. **PAWS**: A paraphrase identification dataset in English.
2. **PAWS-X**: A new dataset for paraphrase identification in six languages: French, Spanish, German, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PAWS**, the citation is:
  > Yuan Zhang, Jason Baldridge, and Chris Tar. *PAWS: Paraphrase Adversaries from Word Scrambling*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 1298â€“1308, 2019. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/P19-1003

- For **PAWS-X**, the citation is:
  > Yinfei Yang, Yuan Zhang, Chris Tar, and Jason Baldridge. *PAWS-X: A Cross-lingual Adversarial Dataset for Paraphrase Identification*. Google Research, Mountain View, 94043. https://github.com/google-research-datasets/paws

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
