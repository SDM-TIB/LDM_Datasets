To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-Tuning BERT for Text Classification" by Chi Sun, Xipeng Qiu, Yige Xu, and Xuanjing Huang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the text classification task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the text classification task and mention eight widely-studied datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **IMDb**: A binary sentiment analysis dataset.
2. **Yelp P.**: A binary sentiment analysis dataset.
3. **Yelp F.**: A binary sentiment analysis dataset.
4. **TREC**: A six-class question classification dataset.
5. **Yahoo! Answers**: A six-class question classification dataset.
6. **AG**: A sentiment analysis dataset.
7. **DBPedia**: A topic classification dataset.
8. **Sogou News**: A Chinese news classification dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **IMDb**, the citation is:
  > Andrew M. Dai and Quoc V. Le. 2015. Semi-supervised sequence learning. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 3079â€“3087.

- For **Yelp P.** and **Yelp F.**, the citations are:
  > Zhang et al. (2015). A three-way multi-task learning approach for text classification.

- For **TREC**, the citation is:
  > Ellen M. Voorhees and Dawn M. Tice. 1999. The TREC-8 question answering track evaluation.

- For **Yahoo! Answers**, the citation is:
  > Zhang et al. (2015). A three-way multi-task learning approach for text classification.

- For **AG**, the citation is:
  > Howard and Ruder (2018). Universal language model fine-tuning for text classification.

- For **DBPedia**, the citation is:
  > Zhang et al. (2015). A three-way multi-task learning approach for text classification.

- For **Sogou News**, the citation is:
  > Wang et al. (2008). Automatic online news issue construction in web environment.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
