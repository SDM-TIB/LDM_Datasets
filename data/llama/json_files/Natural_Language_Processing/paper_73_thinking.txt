To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Segatron: Segment-Aware Transformer for Language Modeling and Understanding" by He Bai, Peng Shi, Jimmy Lin, Yuqing Xie, Luchen Tan, Kun Xiong, and Wen Gao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for language modeling, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of vanilla Transformers and the importance of contextual representations for language modeling. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **WikiText-103**: A large word-level dataset with long-distance dependencies for language modeling.
2. **English Wikipedia**: Used for pre-training the SegaBERT model.
3. **Bookcorpus**: Used for pre-training the SegaBERT model.
4. **SQUAD v1.1**: A reading comprehension dataset used for evaluating the SegaBERT model.
5. **SQUAD v2.0**: A reading comprehension dataset used for evaluating the SegaBERT model.
6. **RACE**: A large-scale reading comprehension dataset used for evaluating the SegaBERT model.
7. **STS-B**: A semantic textual similarity dataset used for evaluating the SegaBERT model.
8. **GLUE**: A general language understanding evaluation benchmark used for evaluating the SegaBERT model.
9. **MNLI**: A natural language inference dataset used for evaluating the SegaBERT model.
10. **QNLI**: A question-answering dataset used for evaluating the SegaBERT model.
11. **STS**: A semantic textual similarity dataset used for evaluating the SegaBERT model.
12. **SICK-R**: A semantic textual similarity dataset used for evaluating the SegaBERT model.
13. **EMF1**: A sentiment analysis dataset used for evaluating the SegaBERT model.
14. **EMF180**: A sentiment analysis dataset used for evaluating the SegaBERT model.
15. **JNLPBA**: A named entity recognition dataset used for evaluating the SegaBERT model.
16. **CHEMDNER**: A named entity recognition dataset used for evaluating the SegaBERT model.
17. **BioCreative II Gene Mention task corpus (BC2GM)**: A named entity recognition dataset used for evaluating the SegaBERT model.
18. **JNLPBA corpus**: A named entity recognition dataset used for evaluating the SegaBERT model.
19. **CHEMDNER corpus**: A named entity recognition dataset used for evaluating the SegaBERT model.
