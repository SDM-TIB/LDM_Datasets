To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distantly-Supervised Neural Relation Extractionwith Side Information using BERT" by Johny Moreira, Chaina Oliveira, David MacEedo, Cleber Zanchettin, and Luciano Barbosa, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of Distant Supervision (DS) and the importance of using side information. They hint at the evaluation of their model on the Google Distant Supervision (GDS) and Riedel datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Google Distant Supervision (GDS) dataset**: This dataset is used for distant supervision relation extraction.
2. **Riedel dataset**: This dataset is used for distant supervision relation extraction.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their model, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **GDS**, the citation is:
  > Jat, S., Khandelwal, S., & Talukdar, P. (2018). Improving DistantlySupervised Relation Extraction using Word and Entity Based Attention. http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06987

- For **Riedel**, the citation is:
  > Riedel, S., Yao, L., & McCallum, A. (2010). Modeling Relations and Their Mentions without Labeled Text. Proceedings of the 2010 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 148-163.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
