To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reverse, Retrieve, and Rank for Sarcasm Generation with Commonsense Knowledge" by Tuhin Chakrabarty, Debanjan Ghosh, Smaranda Muresan, and Nanyun Peng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the biomedical domain, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of word2vec and the importance of character-based representations like fastText. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named entity recognition corpora:

1. **Ghosh et al. (2020)**: A dataset of 4,762 pairs of speakers sarcastic messages and hearers' interpretations.
2. **Peled and Reichart (2017)**: A dataset of 3,000 sarcastic tweets, each interpreted by five human judges.
3. **Multi-Genre NLI (Williams et al., 2018)**: A dataset for natural language inference tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Ghosh et al. (2020)**, the citation is:
  > Debanjan Ghosh, Alexander R Fabbri, and Smaranda Muresan. 2020. Interpreting verbal irony: Linguistic strategies and the connection to the type of semantic incongruity. Proceedings of the Society for Computation in Linguistics, 3(9):76a87.

- For **Peled and Reichart (2017)**, the citation is:
  > Lotem Peled and Roi Reichart. 2017. Sarcasm SIGN: Interpreting sarcasm with sentiment based monolingual machine translation. 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1690a1700, Vancouver, Canada. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **Multi-Genre NLI (Williams et al., 2018)**, the citation is:
  > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel Bowman. 2018. A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), pages 1â€“12, 2018. http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-4002

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
