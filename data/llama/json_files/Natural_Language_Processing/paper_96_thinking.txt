To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Action Recognition with Deep Bidirectional Autoencoders" by A. Piergiovanni and M. S. Ryoo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset and the IAPR TC-12 dataset.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing action recognition models and propose a new approach using deep bidirectional autoencoders. They mention the Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset and the IAPR TC-12 dataset as examples.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset**: This dataset is used for action recognition tasks.
2. **IAPR TC-12 dataset**: This dataset is used for image captioning tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset**, the citation is:
  > W. Kay, J. Carreira, K. Simonyan, B. Zhang, C. Hillier, S. Vijayanarasimhan, F. Viola, T. Green, T. Back, P. Natsev, M. Suleyman, and A. Zisserman. *The kinetics human action video dataset*. CoRR, abs/1705.06950, 2017.

- For **IAPR TC-12 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Li, T. Yao, Y. Pan, H. Chao, and T. Mei. *Jointly localizing and describing events for dense video captioning*. In CVPR, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
