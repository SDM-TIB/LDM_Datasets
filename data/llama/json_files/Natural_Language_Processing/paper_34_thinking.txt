To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Distance Relationships without Time Travel: Boosting the Performance of a Sparse Predictive Autoencoder in Sequence Modeling" by Jeremy Gordon, David Rawlinson, and Subutai Ahmad, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the language modeling task on the Penn Treebank dataset, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the sequence learning domain and the challenge of modeling relationships between related elements separated by long temporal distances. They also mention the Penn Treebank dataset and the MNIST dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Penn Treebank dataset**: This dataset is used for language modeling tasks.
2. **MNIST dataset**: This dataset is used for sequence learning tasks.
3. **FastText embeddings**: This dataset is used for language modeling tasks.
4. **Sub-sequences**: This dataset is used for the stochastic sequential MNIST task.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Penn Treebank dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mikolov, T., Kombrink, S., Burget, L., AernockA12, J., and Khudanpur, S. Re-current neural network based language model. In Eleventh annual conference of the international speech communication association (2010).

- For **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., and Hinton, G. The mnist database. In Advances in neural information processing systems 20 (2007), pages 1â€“8.

- For **FastText embeddings**, the citation is:
  > Bojanowski, P., Grave, E., Joulin, A., and Mikolov, T. Enriching word vectors with subword information. arXiv preprint arXiv:1607.04606 (2016).

- For **Sub-sequences**, the citation is:
  > The authors mention the grammar used in the stochastic sequential MNIST task, but do not provide a specific citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
