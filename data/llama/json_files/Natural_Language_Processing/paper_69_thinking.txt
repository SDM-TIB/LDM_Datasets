To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Make Generalizable and Diverse Predictions for Retrosynthesis" by Benson Chen, Tianxiao Shen, Tommi S. Jaakkola, and Regina Barzilay, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the USPTO-50k dataset.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the USPTO-50k dataset, which is a subset of the open source patent database of chemical reactions.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the USPTO-50k dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the USPTO-50k dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the USPTO-50k dataset:

- For the USPTO-50k dataset, the citation is:
  > Liu et al. (2017) applies these templates for a given target compound based on similar reactions in the dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
