To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Warm-up and Self-Training:Training Strategies of NICT-2 NMT System at WAT-2019" by Kenji Imamura and Eiichiro Sumita, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the NICT-2 NMT system and the datasets used for training and testing.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the NICT-2 NMT system and the datasets used for training and testing.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and testing. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **ASPEC TrainDev.TestTrainDev.TDDCDevTestTest**: This dataset is used for training and testing the NICT-2 NMT system.
2. **AsianScientiic Paper Excerpt Corpus (Nakazawa et al.,2016)**: This dataset is used for training the NICT-2 NMT system.
3. **Timely Disclosure Documents Corpus (TDDC)**: This dataset is used for training and testing the NICT-2 NMT system.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and testing the NICT-2 NMT system.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ASPEC TrainDev.TestTrainDev.TDDCDevTestTest**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
- For **AsianScientiic Paper Excerpt Corpus (Nakazawa et al.,2016)**, the citation is:
  > Toshiaki Nakazawa, Chenchen Ding, Raj Dabre,Hideya Mino, Isao Goto, Win Pa Pa, NobushigeDoi, Yusuke Oda, Anoop Kunchukuttan, Shan-tipriya Parida, OndErej Bojar, and Sadao Kurohashi.2019. Overview of the 6th workshop on Asian trans-lation. In Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on AsianTranslation, Hong Kong.
- For **Timely Disclosure Documents Corpus (TDDC)**, the citation is:
  > Toshiaki Nakazawa, Manabu Yaguchi, Kiyotaka Uchi-moto, Masao Utiyama, Eiichiro Sumita, SadaoKurohashi, and Hitoshi Isahara. 2016. ASPEC:In Pro-Asian scientiic paper excerpt corpus.ceedings of the Tenth International Conference onLanguage Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016),pages 2204a2208, PortoroEz, Slovenia.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
