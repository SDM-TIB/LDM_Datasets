To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Captioning through Image Transformer" by Sen He et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the image captioning task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous image captioning models and the importance of adapting the transformer architecture to images. They hint at the evaluation of their model on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the MSCOCO image captioning dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the MSCOCO dataset was used for evaluation of their model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MSCOCO dataset:

- For MSCOCO, the citation is:
  > Chen, X., Fang, H., Lin, T.Y., Vedantam, R., Gupta, S., DollA ar, P., Zitnick, C.L. *Microsoft coco captions: Data collection and evaluation server*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00325 (2015)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
