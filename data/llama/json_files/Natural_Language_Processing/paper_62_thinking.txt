To extract datasets from the research paper titled "YNU NLP at SemEval-2019 Task 5: Attention and Capsule Ensemble for Identifying Hate Speech" by Bin Wang, Haiyan Ding, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the SemEval-2019 Task 5 and the datasets used for training and testing.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the problem of detecting hate speech on Twitter and the importance of using large datasets for training and testing.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and testing. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SemEval-2019 Task 5 dataset**: This dataset is used for training and testing the hate speech detection model.
2. **Twitter dataset**: This dataset is used for training and testing the hate speech detection model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and testing their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SemEval-2019 Task 5 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Valerio Basile, Cristina Bosco, Elisabetta Fersini, Debora Nozza, Viviana Patti, Francisco Rangel, Paolo Rosso, and Manuela Sanguinetti. 2019. Semeval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech. Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), pages 529a534. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **Twitter dataset**, the citation is:
  > Basile et al., 2019. Semeval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech. Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2019), pages 529a534. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
