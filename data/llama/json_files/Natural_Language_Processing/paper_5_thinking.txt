To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sub-word information in pre-trained biomedical word representations: evaluation and hyper-parameter optimization" by Dieter Galea, Ivan Laponogov, and Kirill Veselkov, I will follow a systematic approach.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of word2vec and the importance of character-based representations like fastText. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named entity recognition corpora:

1. **BC2GM**: This dataset is used for gene recognition tasks.
2. **JNLPBA**: This corpus annotates proteins, cell lines, cell types, DNA, and RNA.
3. **CHEMDNER**: This dataset is focused on annotating drugs and chemicals.
