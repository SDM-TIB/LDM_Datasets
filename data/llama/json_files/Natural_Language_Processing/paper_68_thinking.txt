To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enriching the Transformer with Linguistic Factors for Low-Resource Machine Translation" by Jordi Armengol-Estap, Marta R. Costa-jussÃ , and Carlos Escolano, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the IWSLT14 and IWSLT16 datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of linguistic features in machine translation, but no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **IWSLT14**: A low-resource dataset for German-to-English machine translation.
2. **IWSLT16**: A low-resource dataset for German-to-English machine translation, used for evaluation of the best configuration.
3. **FLoRes**: A low-resource dataset for English-to-Nepali machine translation, used for evaluation of the best configuration.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **IWSLT14**, the citation is:
  > Mauro Cettolo, Jan Niehues, Sebastian StA uker, LuisaBentivogli, and Marcello Federico. 2014. Report on the 11th iwslt evaluation campaign, iwslt 2014. In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, Hanoi, Vietnam, page 57.

- For **IWSLT16**, the citation is:
  > Mauro Cettolo, Jan Niehues, Sebastian StA uker, LuisaBentivogli, and Marcello Federico. 2014. Report on the 11th iwslt evaluation campaign, iwslt 2014. In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, Hanoi, Vietnam, page 57.

- For **FLoRes**, the citation is:
  > Francisco GuzmA an, Peng-Jen Chen, Myle Ott, JuanPino, Guillaume Lample, Philipp Koehn, VishravChaudhary, and MarcaAurelio Ranzato. 2019. Two new evaluation datasets for low-resource machine translation: Nepali-english and sinhala-english. CoRR, abs/1902.01382.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
