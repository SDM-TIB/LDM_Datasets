To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HateMonitors: Language Agnostic Abuse Detection in Social Media" by Punyajoy Saha, Binny Mathew, Pawan Goyal, and Animesh Mukherjee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the hate speech detection task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of hate speech detection in social media and the need for a language-agnostic approach. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named datasets:

1. **HateMonitors dataset**: This dataset is used for hate speech detection in multiple languages, including Hindi, English, and German.
2. **HASOC 2019 dataset**: This dataset is used for hate speech detection in Indo-European languages, including Hindi, English, and German.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **HateMonitors dataset**, the citation is:
  > Punyajoy Saha, Binny Mathew, Pawan Goyal, and Animesh Mukherjee. *HateMonitors: Language Agnostic Abuse Detection in Social Media*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.06700 (2018)

- For **HASOC 2019 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mandl, T., Modha, S., Patel, D., Dave, M., Mandlia, C., Patel, A. *Overview of the HASOC track at FIRE 2019: Hate Speech and Oiensive Content Identiication in Indo-European Languages*. In Proceedings of the 11th annual meeting of the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation (December 2019)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
