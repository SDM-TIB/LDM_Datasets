To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning in Biomedical Named Entity Recognition: An Evaluation of BERT in the PharmaCoNER task" by Cong Sun, Zhihao Yang, and others, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the PharmaCoNER task and the use of Multilingual BERT and BioBERT models.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the PharmaCoNER task and the importance of conducting NLP research in non-English literature.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the PharmaCoNER corpus and the BioBERT model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the PharmaCoNER corpus was used for evaluation of the Multilingual BERT and BioBERT models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PharmaCoNER corpus**, the citation is:
  > Gonzalez-Agirre et al. (2019) PharmaCoNER: Pharmaco logical substances, compounds and proteins named entity recognition.
  > González-Agirre et al. (2019) PharmaCoNER: Pharmaco logical substances, compounds and proteins named entity recognition. In Proceedings of the BioNLP Open Shared Tasks (BioNLP-OST), pages 1–8, 2019.

- For **BioBERT model**, the citation is:
  > Lee et al. (2019) BioBERT: pre-trained biomedical language representation model for biomedical text mining. arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.08746.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
