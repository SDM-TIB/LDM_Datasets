To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HLT@SUDA at SemEval 2019 Task 1: UCCA Graph Parsing as Constituent Tree Parsing" by Wei Jiang, Zhenghua Lia, Yu Zhang, and Min Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of UCCA semantic graphs and constituent trees, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors describe the UCCA framework and its applications, but no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **English-Wiki**: A dataset used for the English closed and open tracks.
2. **German-Wiki**: A dataset used for the German closed and open tracks.
3. **English-20K**: A dataset used for the English closed and open tracks.
4. **German-20K**: A dataset used for the German closed and open tracks.
5. **French-20K**: A dataset used for the French open track.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **English-Wiki**, no specific citation is mentioned.
- For **German-Wiki**, no specific citation is mentioned.
- For **English-20K**, no specific citation is mentioned.
- For **German-20K**, no specific citation is mentioned.
- For **French-20K**, no specific citation is mentioned.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
