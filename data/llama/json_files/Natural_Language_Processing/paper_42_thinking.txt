To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CRAM: Clued Recurrent Aattentionttention Model" by Minki Chung, Sungzoon Choa, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of two computer vision tasks, classiication and inpainting, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of convolutionalneural network and the importance of recurrent attention model(RAM) for better problem solving. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset**: This dataset is used for image inpainting tasks.
2. **MSRA10k dataset**: This dataset is used for image classiication tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., & Ng, A. Y. (2011). Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning (Vol. 2011, No. 2).

- For **MSRA10k**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Boser, B., Denker, J. S., Henderson, D., Howard, R. E., Hubbard, W., & Jackel, L. D. (1989). Backpropagation applied to handwritten zip code recognition. Neural computation, 1(4), 541-551.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
