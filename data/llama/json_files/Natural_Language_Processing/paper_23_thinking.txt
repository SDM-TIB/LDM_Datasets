To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Grammatical Error Detection with Contextual Word Representations" by Samuel Bella, Helen Yannakoudakis, and Marek Rei, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of public GED datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of error-annotated corpora and the importance of using large amounts of unsupervised data. They hint at the evaluation of different contextual embeddings on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention four named datasets:

1. **The First Certificate in English (FCE) dataset**: This dataset is used for error detection and correction tasks.
2. **The CoNLL 2014 shared task dataset**: This dataset is used for error detection and correction tasks.
3. **The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) FLuency-Extended GUG Corpus**: This dataset is used for error detection and correction tasks.
4. **The Cambridge English Write & Improve (W&I) corpus**: This dataset is used for error detection and correction tasks.
5. **The LOCNESS corpus**: This dataset is used for error detection and correction tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **FCE**, the citation is:
  > Helen Yannakoudakis, Aistein E Andersen, Ardeshir Geranpayeh, Ted Briscoe, and Diane Nicholls. *A new dataset and method for automatically grading ESOL texts*. Applied Measurement in Education, 31(3):251-267, 2008.

- For **CoNLL 2014**, the citation is:
  > Hwee Tou Ng, Siew Mei Wu, Ted Briscoe, Christian Hadiwinoto, Raymond Hendy Susanto, and Christopher Bryant. *The CoNLL-2014 shared task on grammatical error correction*. In Proceedings of the Eighteenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning: Shared Task, pages 1-14, 2014.

- For **JHU FLUENCY-EXTENDED GUG Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Courtney Bryant, Mariano Felice, Aistein E Andersen, and Ted Briscoe. *JFLEG: A fluency corpus and benchmark for grammatical error correction*. In Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 229-234, 2017.

- For **Cambridge English Write & Improve (W&I) corpus**, the citation is:
  > Helen Yannakoudakis, Ted Briscoe, and Ben Medlock. *A new dataset and method for automatically grading ESOL texts*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 180-189, 2008.

- For **LOCNESS corpus**, the citation is:
  > Sudhanshu Kasewa, Pontus Stenetorp, and Sebastian Riedel. *Wronging a right: Generating better errors to improve grammatical error detection*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.00668, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
