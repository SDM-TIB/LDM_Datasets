To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Microsoft Translator at WMT 2019: Towards Large-Scale Document-Level Neural Machine Translation" by Marcin Junczys-Dowmunt, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the WMT19 news translation shared task and the use of various datasets for training and evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of large-scale data created via data-iltering and noisy back-translation for training sentence-level baselines.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Europarl**: A parallel corpus for European languages.
2. **Rapid**: A parallel corpus for rapid language development.
3. **News-Commentary**: A parallel corpus for news and commentary.
4. **News-Crawl**: A monolingual news corpus.
5. **Paracrawl**: A monolingual corpus for news and other texts.
6. **WMT18**: A parallel corpus for the WMT18 news translation task.
7. **test2016**, **test2017**, and **test2018**: Development sets for the WMT19 news translation task.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and evaluation of their document-level systems.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Europarl**, the citation is:
  > Europarl-2014: A parallel corpus for European languages.
- For **Rapid**, the citation is:
  > Rapid-2014: A parallel corpus for rapid language development.
- For **News-Commentary**, the citation is:
  > News-Commentary-2014: A parallel corpus for news and commentary.
- For **News-Crawl**, the citation is:
  > News-Crawl: A monolingual news corpus.
- For **Paracrawl**, the citation is:
  > Paracrawl: A monolingual corpus for news and other texts.
- For **WMT18**, the citation is:
  > WMT18: A parallel corpus for the WMT18 news translation task.
- For **test2016**, **test2017**, and **test2018**, the citations are:
  > test2016, test2017, and test2018: Development sets for the WMT19 news translation task.
