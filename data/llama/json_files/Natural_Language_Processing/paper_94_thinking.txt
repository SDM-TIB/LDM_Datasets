To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural language understanding for task-oriented dialogue in the biomedical domain in a low-resource context" by Antoine Neuraz, Anita Burgun, Leonardo Campillos Llanos, and Sophie Rosset, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of paraphrasing and word representations learned on a large EHR corpus, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the lack of sharable datasets in the biomedical domain and the need for developing natural language processing systems.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **EHR corpus**: A large corpus of Electronic Health Records.
2. **NLU task dataset**: A dataset for natural language understanding tasks, divided into three sub-tasks: domain classification, intent classification, and slot-illing.
3. **Real-world data**: A test set for evaluating the performance of the proposed method.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **EHR corpus**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.
- For **NLU task dataset**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.
- For **Real-world data**, the citation is not explicitly mentioned.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
