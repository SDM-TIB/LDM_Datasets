To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combating Adversarial Misspellings with Robust Word Recognition" by Danish Pruthi, Bhuwan Dhingra, Zachary C. Lipton, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of word recognition models on various datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of word recognition models and the importance of character-based representations like ScRNN. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis tasks.
2. **IMDB movie reviews**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis tasks.
3. **SQuAD dataset**: This dataset is used for reading comprehension tasks.
4. **MRPC dataset**: This dataset is used for paraphrase detection tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SST**, the citation is:
  > Socher et al. (2013) - This dataset is used for sentiment analysis tasks.

- For **IMDB movie reviews**, the citation is:
  > Maas et al. (2011) - This dataset is used for sentiment analysis tasks.

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar et al. (2016) - This dataset is used for reading comprehension tasks.

- For **MRPC**, the citation is:
  > Dolan and Brockett (2005) - This dataset is used for paraphrase detection tasks.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
