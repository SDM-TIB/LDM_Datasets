To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KU AI at MEDIQA 2019: Domain-specific Pre-training and Transfer Learning for Medical NLI" by Mil Cengiz, Deniz Yuret, Ulas A Sert, and Koc, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the medical domain, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of word2vec and the importance of character-based representations like fastText. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named entity recognition corpora:

1. **MedNLI**: This dataset is used for natural language inference tasks.
2. **MultiNLI**: This dataset is used for natural language inference tasks.
3. **SNLI**: This dataset is used for natural language inference tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MedNLI**, the citation is:
  > Romanov and Shivade (2018)

- For **MultiNLI**, the citation is:
  > Williams et al. (2018)

- For **SNLI**, the citation is:
  > Bowman et al. (2015)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
