To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RECON: Relation Extraction using Knowledge Graph Context in a Graph Neural Network" by Anson Bastos, Abhishek Nadgeri, Kuldeep Singh, Isaiah Onando Mulanga, Saeedeh Shekarpour, Johannes Hoffart, and Manohar Kaul, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the RECON method on two standard relation extraction datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing RE approaches and the importance of incorporating knowledge graph context.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Wikidata dataset**: This dataset is used for relation extraction tasks.
2. **NYT Freebase dataset**: This dataset is used for relation extraction tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the RECON method.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Wikidata dataset**, the citation is:
  > https://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/entities/

- For **NYT Freebase dataset**, the citation is:
  > https://developers.google.com/freebase

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
