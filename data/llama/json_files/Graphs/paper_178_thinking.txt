To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Biological Knowledge with FactorGraph Neural Network for Interpretable DeepLearning" by Tianle Ma and Aidong Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the biomedical domain, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of deep learning and the importance of incorporating biological knowledge. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **TCGA-LUSC**: A dataset containing gene expression data for Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
2. **TCGA-KIRC**: A dataset containing gene expression data for Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **TCGA-LUSC**, the citation is:
  > Tianle Ma and Aidong Zhang. Incorporating Biological Knowledge with FactorGraph Neural Network for Interpretable DeepLearning. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.09465, 2021.

- For **TCGA-KIRC**, the citation is:
  > Tianle Ma and Aidong Zhang. Incorporating Biological Knowledge with FactorGraph Neural Network for Interpretable DeepLearning. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.09465, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
