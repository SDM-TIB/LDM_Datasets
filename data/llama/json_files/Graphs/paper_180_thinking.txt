To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Micro-Expression Recognition Based on Relation Modeling with Graph Convolutional Networks" by Ling Lo, Hong-Han Shuai, Hong-Xia Xie, and Wen-Huang Cheng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the CASME II dataset and the CASME II dataset is used for MER analysis.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing MER datasets and the importance of using a spontaneous dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the CASME II dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the CASME II dataset was used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CASME II dataset:

- For **CASME II**, the citation is:
  > W.-J. Yan, X. Li, S.-J. Wang, G. Zhao, Y.-J. Liu, Y.-H. Chen, and X. Fu. *Casme ii: An improved spontaneous micro-expression database and the baseline evaluation*. PLoS ONE, 9(1):e86041, 2014. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0086041

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
