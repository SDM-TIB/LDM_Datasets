To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PRIN: Point-wise Rotation Invariant Network" by Yang You, Yujing Lou, Ruoxi Shi, Qi Liu, Yu-Wing Tai, Lizhuang Ma, Weiming Wang, and Cewu Lu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the point cloud analysis, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing methods for point cloud analysis and the importance of rotation invariant features. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **ShapeNet part dataset**: This dataset is used for part segmentation tasks.
2. **ModelNet40**: This dataset is used for classification tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ShapeNet part dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yi, V. G. Kim, D. Ceylan, I.-C. Shen, M. Yan, H. Su, C. Lu, Q. Huang, A. Sheffer, and L. Guibas. *A scalable active framework for region annotation in 3D shape collections*. SIGGRAPH Asia, 2016.

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z. Song, A. Khosla, F. Yu, L. Zhang, X. Tang, and J. Xiao. *3D shape networks*. Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
