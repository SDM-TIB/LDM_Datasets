To extract datasets from the research paper titled "0202OPAL-Net: A Generative Model for Part-based ObjectLayout Generation" by Rishabh Baghel and Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the training of OPAL-Net on PASCAL-Parts dataset.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of generative models for objects and the importance of part-based object representation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following dataset:

1. **PASCAL-Parts dataset**: This dataset is used for training OPAL-Net.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the PASCAL-Parts dataset was used for training and evaluation of OPAL-Net.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for this dataset:

- For **PASCAL-Parts dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shih-Fan Cheng, et al. *PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2009 (VOC 2009)*. In Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1â€“9, 2009. http://www.cs.unc.edu/~efro/Projects/Car/Challenge.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
