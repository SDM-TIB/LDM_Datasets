To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Structure Learning for Robust Graph Neural Networks" by Wei Jin, Yao Ma, Xiaorui Liu, Xianfeng Tang, Suhang Wang, and Jiliang Tang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the graph neural network, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of graph neural networks and the importance of defending against adversarial attacks. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention four named datasets:

1. **Cora**: A citation graph dataset.
2. **Citeseer**: A citation graph dataset.
3. **Pubmed**: A citation graph dataset.
4. **Polblogs**: A blog graph dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Thomas N Kipf and Max Welling. 2016. Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.02907 (2016).

- For **Citeseer**, the citation is:
  > Thomas N Kipf and Max Welling. 2016. Variational graph auto-encoders. arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.07308 (2016).

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is:
  > Thomas N Kipf and Max Welling. 2016. Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.02907 (2016).

- For **Polblogs**, the citation is:
  > Felix Wu, Tianyi Zhang, Amauri Holanda de Souza Jr, Christopher Fifty, Tao Yu, and Kilian Q Weinberger. 2019. Simplifying graph convolutional networks. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.07153 (2019).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
