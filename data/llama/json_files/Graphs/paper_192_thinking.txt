To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Budget-Driven Hardware Optimization for DeepConvolutional Neural Networks using Stochastic Computing" by Zhe Lia, Ji Lia, Ao Rena, Caiwen Ding, Jeffrey Draperaa, Qinru Qiua, Bo YuanA, Yanzhi Wangaa, we will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the biomedical domain, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of word2vec and the importance of character-based representations like fastText. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the MNIST handwritten digit image dataset:

1. **MNIST dataset**: This dataset is used for handwritten digit classification tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the MNIST dataset was used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces its relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for this dataset:

- For **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the 30th Annual Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pages 322–327, 1998.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
