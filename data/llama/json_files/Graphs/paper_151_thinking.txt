To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accurate Pulmonary Nodule Detection in Computed Tomography Images Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" by Jia Ding, Aoxue Li, Zhiqiang Hu, and Liwei Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the LUNA16 Challenge and the LIDC-IDRI dataset, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of accurate pulmonary nodule detection in CT images and mention the LUNA16 Challenge.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **LUNA16 Challenge**: This dataset is used for pulmonary nodule detection.
2. **LIDC-IDRI**: This dataset is used for pulmonary nodule detection.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LUNA16 Challenge**, the citation is:
  > S.G. Armato, G. McLennan, L. Bidaut, and et al. The lung imagedatabase consortium (lidc) and image database resource initiative (idri):8a completed reference database of lung nodules on ct scans. Medicalphysics, 38(2):915a931, 2011.

- For **LIDC-IDRI**, the citation is:
  > S.G. Armato, G. McLennan, L. Bidaut, and et al. The lung imagedatabase consortium (lidc) and image database resource initiative (idri):8a completed reference database of lung nodules on ct scans. Medicalphysics, 38(2):915a931, 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
