To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stochastic Shared Embeddings: Data-driven Regularization of Embedding Layers" by Liwei Wu, Cho-Jui Hsieh, and James Sharpnack, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the recommender systems and natural language processing tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing regularization techniques and the importance of data-driven regularization. They hint at the evaluation of their proposed method on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Movielens1m**: A dataset for explicit feedback recommender systems.
2. **Movielens10m**: A dataset for explicit feedback recommender systems.
3. **Douban**: A dataset for explicit feedback recommender systems.
4. **Netiix**: A dataset for explicit feedback recommender systems.
5. **Movielens10m**: A dataset for implicit feedback recommender systems.
6. **Douban**: A dataset for implicit feedback recommender systems.
7. **Yahoo Music**: A dataset for implicit feedback recommender systems.
8. **Foursquare**: A dataset for implicit feedback recommender systems.
9. **IMDB**: A dataset for sentiment classification.
10. **SST-2**: A dataset for sentiment classification.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Movielens1m**, the citation is:

- For **Foursquare**, the citation is:

- For **IMDB**, the citation is:
  > Jeremy Howard and Sebastian Ruder. Universal language model ine-tuning for text classiica-tion. arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.06146, 2018.

- For **SST-2**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
