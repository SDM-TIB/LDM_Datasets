To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GRAPHCGAN: CONVOLUTIONAL GRAPH NEURALNETWORK WITH GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NET-WORKS" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the graph-based semi-supervised learning tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of graph-based semi-supervised learning and the importance of combining convolutional graph neural networks and generative adversarial networks. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named datasets:

1. **Cora**: A citation is found in the references section:
