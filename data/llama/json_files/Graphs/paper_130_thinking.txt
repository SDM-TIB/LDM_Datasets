To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SeCo: Exploring Sequence Supervision for Unsupervised Representation Learning" by Ting Yao, Yiheng Zhang, Zhaofan Qiu, Yingwei Pan, and Tao Mei, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the exploration of sequence supervision for unsupervised representation learning, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of supervised learning and the importance of unsupervised representation learning. They hint at the evaluation of their model on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Kinetics400**: A large-scale action recognition benchmark.
2. **UCF101**: A popular action recognition benchmark.
3. **HMDB51**: A widely used action recognition dataset.
4. **ActivityNet**: A large-scale human activity understanding benchmark.
5. **GOT-10K**: A large high-diversity benchmark for generic object tracking.
6. **OTB-100**: A widely adopted dataset for object tracking.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their model, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Kinetics400**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
