To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Graph Transformer for Free-Hand Sketch Recognition" by Peng Xua, Chaitanya K. Joshi, and Xavier Bresson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the sketch recognition task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing techniques for sketch recognition and the importance of capturing both geometric structure and temporal information from sketch graphs. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the Google QuickDraw dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the Google QuickDraw dataset was used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Google QuickDraw dataset:

- For Google QuickDraw, the citation is:
  > Google QuickDraw dataset

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
