To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hebbian Semi-Supervised Learning in a Sample Eiciency Setting" by Gabriele Lagani, Fabrizio Falchi, Claudio Gennaro, and Giuseppe Amato, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various datasets for experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the issue of sample eiciency in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) and propose a semi-supervised training strategy that combines Hebbian learning with gradient descent.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for experiments. Here, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: A dataset containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, belonging to 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR100**: A dataset containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, belonging to 100 classes.
3. **Tiny ImageNet**: A dataset containing 100,000 training images and 10,000 test images, belonging to 200 classes.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., & Hinton, G. E. (2012). ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) (pp. 1097-1105).

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., & Hinton, G. E. (2012). ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) (pp. 1097-1105).

- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Wu, J., Zhang, Q., & Xu, G. (2017). Tiny ImageNet challenge. Tech. Rep.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
