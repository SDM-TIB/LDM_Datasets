To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Trafic Forecasting" by Jun Fu, Wei Zhou, and Zhibo Chen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the trafic forecasting task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing trafic forecasting methods and the importance of incorporating spatial and temporal dependencies. They hint at the evaluation of their proposed method on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **SZ-taxi dataset**: This dataset records the trafic speed of 156 major roads in Luohu District, Shen Zhen from Jan. 1 to Jan. 31, 2015.
2. **Los-loop dataset**: This dataset collects the trafic speed of 207 highways in Los Angeles County from Mar. 1 to Mar. 7, 2012.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their proposed method.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SZ-taxi dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. Guerrini, aTrafic congestion costs americans $124billion a year, report says,a Forbes, October, vol. 14,2014.

- For **Los-loop dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Liu and W. Guan, aA summary of trafic iow fore-casting methods [j],a Journal of Highway and Transportion Research and Development, vol. 3, pp. 82a85, 2004.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
