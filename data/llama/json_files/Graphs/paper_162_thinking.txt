To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantum Deep Field (QDF): A Machine Learning Model for Predicting Molecular Energies" by Masashi Tsubaki and Teruyasu Mizoguchi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the molecular graph convolutional network (GCN) and the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO), which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of extant molecular GCNs and the importance of using a more accurate basis function set. They hint at the evaluation of the QDF model on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **QM9 dataset**: This dataset contains approximately 130,000 molecules made up of H, C, N, O, and F atoms along with 13 quantum chemical properties (e.g., atomization energy, HOMO, and LUMO) for each molecule.
2. **QM9under14atoms dataset**: This dataset is a subset of the QM9 dataset with a limited number of atoms (14 or less) per molecule.
3. **QM9over15atoms dataset**: This dataset is a subset of the QM9 dataset with more than 15 atoms per molecule.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of the QDF model, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **QM9 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Raghunathan Ramakrishnan, Pavlo O Dral, Matthias Rupp, and O Anatole Von Lilienfeld. *Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules*. Scientiic Data, 1(1):140022, 2014. https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2014.22

- For **QM9under14atoms dataset**, the citation is:
  > Masashi Tsubaki and Teruyasu Mizoguchi. *Quantum Deep Field (QDF): A Machine Learning Model for Predicting Molecular Energies*. (This paper)

- For **QM9over15atoms dataset**, the citation is:
  > Masashi Tsubaki and Teruyasu Mizoguchi. *Quantum Deep Field (QDF): A Machine Learning Model for Predicting Molecular Energies*. (This paper)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
