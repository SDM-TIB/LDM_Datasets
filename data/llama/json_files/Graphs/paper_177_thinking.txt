To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Self-Supervised Gait Encoding Approach with Locality-Awareness for 3D Skeleton Based Person Re-Identification" by Haocong Rao, Siqi Wang, Xiping Hu, Mingkui Tan, Yi Guo, Jun Cheng, Xinwang Liu, and Bin Hu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the person Re-ID task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing methods for person Re-ID and the importance of learning discriminative gait features from 3D skeleton data.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **BIWI**: A dataset containing 13636 skeletons estimated from original RGB images.
2. **IAS-Lab**: A dataset containing 108872 skeletons estimated from original RGB images.
3. **KS20**: A dataset containing 16464 skeletons estimated from original RGB images.
4. **KGBD**: A dataset containing 124 skeletons estimated from original RGB images.
5. **CASIA B**: A dataset containing 124 skeletons estimated from original RGB images.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **BIWI**, the citation is:
  > Munaro et al. (2014) One-shot person re-identification with a consumer depth camera.

- For **IAS-Lab**, the citation is:
  > Munaro et al. (2014) One-shot person re-identification with a consumer depth camera.

- For **KS20**, the citation is:
  > Munaro et al. (2014) One-shot person re-identification with a consumer depth camera.

- For **KGBD**, the citation is:
  > Haque et al. (2016) Recurrent attention models for depth-based person identification.

- For **CASIA B**, the citation is:
  > Yu et al. (2016) Multi-task learning with low rank attribute embedding for multi-camera person re-identification.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
