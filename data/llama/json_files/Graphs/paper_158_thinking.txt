To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentiable Graph Module (DGM) for GraphConvolutional Networks" by Anees Kazi, Luca Cosmo, Seyed-Ahmad Ahmadi, Nassir Navab, and Michael M. Bronstein, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the DGM model on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of current graph neural network architectures and the need for a differentiable graph module. They hint at the evaluation of the DGM model on benchmark datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three benchmark graph datasets:

1. **Cora**: A citation graph dataset.
2. **CiteSeer**: A citation graph dataset.
3. **Pubmed**: A citation graph dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the DGM model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93–98.

- For **CiteSeer**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93–98.

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93–98.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
