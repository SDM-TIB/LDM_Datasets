To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal-RCNN: Universal Object Detector via Transferable Graph R-CNN" by Hang Xu, Linpu Fang, Xiaodan Liang, Wenxiong Kang, and Zhenguo Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the object detection approaches and the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of object detection approaches and the importance of designing a universal object detector that can adapt to other domains without extensive retraining. They mention three object detection benchmarks: COCO, Visual Genome (VG), and ADE.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: A large-scale object detection dataset with 80 object classes.
2. **Visual Genome (VG)**: A large-scale object detection dataset with over 33K object categories.
3. **ADE (ADE20K)**: A large-scale object detection dataset with 20K object instances.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their Universal-RCNN model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M.; Van Gool, L.; Williams, C. K. I.; Winn, J.; and Zisserman, A. *The pascal visual object classes (voc) International Journal of Computer Vision*, 88(2):303–318, 2010.

- For **Visual Genome (VG)**, the citation is:
  > Krishna, R.; Zhu, Y.; Groth, O.; Johnson, J.; Hata, K.;Kravitz, J.; Chen, S.; Kalantidis, Y.; Li, L.-J.; Shamma, D. A.;Bernstein, M.; and Fei-Fei, L. *Visual genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations* International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

- For **ADE (ADE20K)**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, B.; Zhao, H.; Puig, X.; Fidler, S.; Barriuso, A.; andInTorralba, A. *Scene parsing through ade20k dataset* CVPR, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
