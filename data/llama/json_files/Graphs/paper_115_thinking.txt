To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sentiment Analysis for Troll Detection on Weibo" by Zidong Jiang, S. Mark Stamp, and A. S, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various datasets for sentiment analysis and troll detection, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the impact of social media on the modern world and the importance of detecting trolls on Weibo. They mention the use of various datasets for sentiment analysis and troll detection.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Chinese segmentation dataset**: This dataset is used for Chinese sentence segmentation.
2. **Sentiment analysis dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis.
3. **Troll detection dataset**: This dataset is used for troll detection.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Chinese segmentation dataset**, the citation is:
  > Thomas Emerson. The second international Chinese word segmentation bakeoff. https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/65e9/0d9f6754d32db464f635e7fdec672fad9ccf.pdf, 2005.

- For **Sentiment analysis dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rui Wang. SnowNLP Python package. https://github.com/isnowfy/snownlp, 2018.

- For **Troll detection dataset**, the citation is:
  > Linqing Liu, Yao Lu, Ye Luo, Renxian Zhang, Laurent Itti, and Jianwei Lu. Detecting asmartaspammers on social network: A topic model approach. In Proceedings of the NAACL StudentResearch Workshop, pages 45a50, San Diego, California, 2016. Association for ComputationalLinguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
