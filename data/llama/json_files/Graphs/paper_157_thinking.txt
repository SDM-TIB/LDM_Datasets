To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis of Atomistic Representations Using Weighted Skip-Connections" by Kim A. Nicoli et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the QM9 and MD17 datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the extension of the SchNet architecture using weighted skip connections. They mention the QM9 and MD17 datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention the QM9 and MD17 datasets.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **QM9**, the citation is:
  > Raghunathan Ramakrishnan, Pavlo O Dral, Matthias Rupp, and O Anatole von Lilienfeld. *Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules*. Sci. Data, 1, 2014.

- For **MD17**, the citation is:
  > Lars Ruddigkeit, Ruud van Deursen, Lorenz C. Blum, and Jean-Louis Reymond. *Enumeration of 166 billion organic small molecules in the chemical universe database gdb-17*. J. Chem. Inf. Model., 52(11):2864â€“2875, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
