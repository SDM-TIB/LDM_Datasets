To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Open Domain Recognition by Semantic Discrepancy Minimization" by Junbao Zhuo, Shuhui Wang, Shuhao Cui, and Qingming Huang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed method on two datasets: I2AwA and I2WebV.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the unsupervised open domain recognition problem and the challenges of domain discrepancy between the source and target domains.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **I2AwA**: A small-scale dataset consisting of 50 animal classes, with a total of 37,322 images and an average of 746 images per class.
2. **I2WebV**: A large-scale dataset consisting of 1,000 classes, with 1,279,847 images in total.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the proposed method.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **I2AwA**, the citation is:
  > Y. Xian, B. Schiele, and Z. Akata. *Zero-shot learning*. arXiv preprint the bad and the ugly.the good,arXiv:1703.04394, 2017.

- For **I2WebV**, the citation is:
  > W. Li, L. Wang, W. Li, E. Agustsson, and L. Van Gool. *Webvision database: Visual learning and understanding from web data*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.02862, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
