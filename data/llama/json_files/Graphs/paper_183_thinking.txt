To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LEARNING A TRANSFERABLE SCHEDULING POLICY FOR VARIOUS VEHICLE ROUTING PROBLEMS BASEDON GRAPH-CENTRIC REPRESENTATION LEARNING" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the vehicle routing problem, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing algorithms for solving vehicle routing problems and the importance of developing a transferable scheduling policy.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Random mCVRP instances**: These are instances of the multi-vehicle routing problem (mCVRP) generated randomly.
2. **mTSP instances**: These are instances of the multi-traveling salesman problem (mTSP) generated randomly.
3. **CVRP instances**: These are instances of the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) generated randomly.
4. **TSP instances**: These are instances of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) generated randomly.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Random mCVRP instances**, no specific citation is mentioned.
- For **mTSP instances**, no specific citation is mentioned.
- For **CVRP instances**, no specific citation is mentioned.
- For **TSP instances**, no specific citation is mentioned.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
