To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Directional Message Passing for Molecular Graphs" by Johannes Gasteiger, Janek GroA & Stephan GA14nnemann, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of models for molecular properties, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of graph neural networks and the importance of incorporating directional information. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **MD17**: A dataset of 8 small organic molecules.
2. **QM9**: A dataset of 130,000 molecules in equilibrium.
3. **QM9 validation set**: A subset of the QM9 dataset used for validation.
4. **QM9 test set**: A subset of the QM9 dataset used for testing.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MD17**, the citation is:
  > Chmiela et al. (2017) MD17: A benchmark for molecular dynamics simulations.

- For **QM9**, the citation is:
  > Ramakrishnan et al. (2014) Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules.

- For **QM9 validation set** and **QM9 test set**, the citations are:
  > Ramakrishnan et al. (2014) Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
