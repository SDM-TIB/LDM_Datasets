To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CONTEXT-AWARE SHORT-TERM INTEREST FIRST MODEL FOR SESSION-BASED RECOMMENDATION" by Haomei Duan and Jinghua Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of two real-world datasets for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of session-based recommendation and the limitations of previous methods.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for experiments. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Yoochoose**: A real-world dataset used for experiments.
2. **Diginetica**: A real-world dataset used for experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Yoochoose**, the citation is:
  > Haomei Duan and Jinghua Zhu. Context-Aware Short-Term Interest First Model for Session-Based Recommendation. (no specific citation number provided)

- For **Diginetica**, the citation is:
  > Haomei Duan and Jinghua Zhu. Context-Aware Short-Term Interest First Model for Session-Based Recommendation. (no specific citation number provided)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
