To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intriguing Properties of Contrastive Losses" by Ting Chen, Calvin Luo, and Lala Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the study of three intriguing properties of contrastive learning, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the standard contrastive loss and its limitations, hinting at the evaluation of different datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **MultiDigits dataset**: A dataset composed of MNIST digits placed on a shared canvas, with varying numbers of digits and placement strategies.
2. **DigitOnImageNet dataset**: A dataset created by overlaying MNIST digits on ImageNet images via channel addition/summation.
3. **RandBit dataset**: A dataset constructed by concatenating real images with images of random integers in their channel dimension.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their contrastive learning methods.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MultiDigits dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ting Chen, Simon Kornblith, Mohammad Norouzi, and Geoffrey Hinton. A simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations. arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.05709, 2020.

- For **DigitOnImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ting Chen, Calvin Luo, and Lala Li. Intriguing Properties of Contrastive Losses. arXiv preprint arXiv:1202.05709, 2020.

- For **RandBit dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ting Chen, Calvin Luo, and Lala Li. Intriguing Properties of Contrastive Losses. arXiv preprint arXiv:1202.05709, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
