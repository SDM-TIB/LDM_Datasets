To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A System for Automated Open-Source Threat Intelligence Gathering and Management" by Peng Gao, Xiaoyuan Liu, Edward Choi, Bhavna Soman, Chinmaya Mishra, Kate Farris, and Dawn Song, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the collection of OSCTI reports from various sources, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing OSCTI gathering and management systems and the need for a new system that can harvest and manage high-fidelity threat intelligence in an automated, intelligent, and principled way.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named entity recognition corpora:

1. **MITRE ATT&CK**: This dataset is used for threat actor, technique, and tool recognition.
2. **PhishTank**: This dataset is used for phishing attack detection.
3. **SecureList**: This dataset is used for malware detection.
4. **Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX)**: This dataset is used for threat intelligence sharing.
5. **ThreatCrowd**: This dataset is used for threat intelligence sharing.
6. **ThreatMiner**: This dataset is used for threat intelligence sharing.
7. **AlienVault OTX**: This dataset is used for threat intelligence sharing.
8. **JNLPBA**: This dataset is used for named entity recognition.
9. **BC2GM**: This dataset is used for gene recognition.
10. **CHEMDNER**: This dataset is used for chemical and drug recognition.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their system, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MITRE ATT&CK**, the citation is:
  > [2] [n.d.]. MITRE ATT&CK. https://attack.mitre.org.

- For **PhishTank**, the citation is:
  > [4] [n.d.]. PhishTank. https://www.phishtank.com/.

- For **SecureList**, the citation is:
  > [5] [n.d.]. SecureList. https://securelist.com/.

- For **Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX)**, the citation is:
  > [6] [n.d.]. Structured Threat Information eXpression. http://stixproject.github.io/.

- For **ThreatCrowd**, the citation is:
  > [8] [n.d.]. ThreatCrowd. https://www.threatcrowd.org/.

- For **ThreatMiner**, the citation is:
  > [9] [n.d.]. ThreatMiner. https://www.threatminer.org/.

- For **AlienVault OTX**, the citation is:
  > [1] [n.d.]. AlienVault OTX. https://otx.alienvault.com/.

- For **JNLPBA**, the citation is:
  > [10] Jin-Dong Kim, Tomoko Ohta, Yoshimasa Tsuruoka, Yuka Tateisi, and Nigel Collier. *Introduction to the bio-entity recognition task at JNLPBA*. In Proceedings of the 2004 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), pages 70–75, 2004. http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-1213

- For **BC2GM**, the citation is:
  > Larry Smith, Lorraine K Tanabe, Rie Johnson nee Ando, Cheng-Ju Kuo, I-Fang Chung, Chun-Nan Hsu, Yu-Shi Lin, Roman Klinger, Christoph M Friedrich, Kuzman Ganchev, et al. *Overview of biocreative ii gene mention recognition*. Genome biology, 9(Suppl 2):1–19, 2008. https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2008-9-s2-s2

- For **CHEMDNER**, the citation is:
  > Martin Krallinger, Florian Leitner, Obdulia Rabal, Miguel Vazquez, Julen Oyarzabal, and Alfonso Valencia. *CHEMDNER: The drugs and chemical names extraction challenge*. Journal of Cheminformatics, 7(Suppl 1):S1, 2015. https://doi.org/10.1186/1758-2946-7-S1-S1

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
