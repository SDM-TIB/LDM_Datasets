To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks" by Vijay Prakash Dwivedi, Chaitanya K. Joshi, Anh Tuan Luu, Thomas Laurent, and Yoshua Bengio, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the benchmarking framework for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and the use of various datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of benchmarks for GNNs and the need for a standardized framework.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for benchmarking. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **ZINC**: A dataset of molecular graphs used for graph regression tasks.
2. **AQSOL**: A dataset of molecular graphs used for graph regression tasks.
3. **OGB-LAB**: A dataset of molecular graphs used for link prediction tasks.
4. **WikiCS**: A dataset of graphs used for node classification tasks.
5. **MNIST**: A dataset of images used for graph classification tasks.
6. **CIFAR10**: A dataset of images used for graph classification tasks.
7. **PATTERN**: A dataset of graphs used for graph classification tasks.
8. **CLUSTER**: A dataset of graphs used for graph classification tasks.
9. **CYCLES**: A dataset of graphs used for cycle detection tasks.
10. **GraphTheoryProp**: A dataset of graphs used for graph classification tasks.
11. **TU**: A dataset of graphs used for graph classification tasks.
12. **ENZYMES**: A dataset of graphs used for graph classification tasks.
13. **DD**: A dataset of graphs used for graph classification tasks.
14. **PROTEINS**: A dataset of graphs used for graph classification tasks.
15. **COLLAB**: A dataset of graphs used for link prediction tasks.
16. **CSL**: A dataset of graphs used for graph classification tasks.
17. **TSP**: A dataset of graphs used for link prediction tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for benchmarking GNNs.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:
