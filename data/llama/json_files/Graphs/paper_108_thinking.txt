To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Personalized Graph Neural Networks with Attention Mechanism for Session-Aware Recommendation" by Mengqi Zhang, Shu Wu, Meng Gao, Xin Jiang, Ke Xu, and Liang Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the session-aware recommendation task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing session-aware recommendation methods and the importance of capturing complex item transition relationships and the effects of different historical sessions on the current session.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Xing dataset**: This dataset contains interactions on job postings for 770,000 users over an 80-day period.
2. **Reddit dataset**: This dataset contains tuples of user name, a subreddit where the user makes a comment to a thread, and a timestamp for the interaction.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Xing dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xing, et al. *Xing dataset*. (No specific citation provided)

- For **Reddit dataset**, the citation is:
  > Reddit, et al. *Reddit dataset*. (No specific citation provided)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
