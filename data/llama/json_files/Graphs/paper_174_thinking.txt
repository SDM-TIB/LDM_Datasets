To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large age-gap face verification by feature injection in deep networks" by Simone Bianco, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the Large Age-Gap (LAG) dataset and the CASIA-WebFace dataset.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of face verification across large age gaps and introduce the LAG dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Large Age-Gap (LAG) dataset**: This dataset contains images of 1,010 celebrities spanning large age gaps.
2. **CASIA-WebFace**: This dataset is used for face recognition tasks.
3. **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)**: This dataset is used for face verification tasks.
4. **Pubig**: This dataset contains 58,797 images of 200 identities.
5. **CasiaWebFace**: This dataset is used for face recognition tasks.
6. **FGNet**: This dataset contains 1,002 images of 82 people with age range from 0 to 69 and an age gap up to 45 years.
7. **MORPH**: This dataset contains 55,134 images of 13,618 people with age range from 16 to 77 and an age gap up to 5 years.
8. **CACD**: This dataset contains 163,446 images of 200 identities.
9. **CAFE**: This dataset contains 4,659 images of 901 people.
