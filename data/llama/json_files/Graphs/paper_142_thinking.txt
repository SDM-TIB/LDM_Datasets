To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Residual Correlation in Graph Neural Network Regression" by Junteng Jia and Austin R. Benson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of models for graph neural network regression, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional graph-based semi-supervised learning methods and the importance of modeling label correlations. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Ising model**: A widely-used random model in statistical physics.
2. **U.S. election maps**: A dataset containing county-level demographic and election statistics.
3. **Transportation networks**: A dataset containing traffic data in cities of Anaheim and Chicago.
4. **Sexual interaction network**: A dataset containing relationships among 1,888 individuals.
5. **Twitch social network**: A dataset representing online friendships amongst Twitch streamers in Portugal.
6. **Ising(+) dataset**: A subset of the Ising model dataset with positive correlations.
7. **Ising(-) dataset**: A subset of the Ising model dataset with negative correlations.
8. **Anaheim dataset**: A subset of the U.S. election maps dataset.
9. **Chicago dataset**: A subset of the U.S. election maps dataset.
10. **Twitch-PT dataset**: A subset of the Twitch social network dataset.
11. **Sexual dataset**: A subset of the sexual interaction network dataset.
12. **Household income dataset**: A dataset containing county-level median household incomes.
13. **Education dataset**: A dataset containing county-level education levels.
14. **Unemployment dataset**: A dataset containing county-level unemployment rates.
15. **Election dataset**: A dataset containing county-level election outcomes.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Ising model**, the citation is:

  > https://github.com/000Justin000/gnn-residual-correlation

- For **Election dataset**, the citation is:
  > https://github.com/000Justin000/gnn-residual-correlation

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
