To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VERSE: Versatile Graph Embeddings from Similarity Measures" by Anton Tsitsulin, Davide Mottin, Panagiotis Karras, and Emmanuel MA14ller, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of VERSE on several real-world datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of graph embeddings and the limitations of previous methods. They hint at the evaluation of VERSE on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three real-world datasets:

1. **BlogCatalog**: A network of social interactions among bloggers in the BlogCatalog website.
2. **Microsoft Academic Graph**: A network of academic papers, citations, authors, and affiliations from Microsoft Academic website.
3. **CoAuthor**: A co-authorship network among authors.
4. **CoCit**: A network of papers citing other papers; labels represent conferences in which papers were published.
5. **VK**: A Russian all-encompassing social network.
6. **YouTube**: A network of social interactions among users of the YouTube video platform.
7. **Orkut**: A network of social interactions among users of the Orkut social network platform.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of VERSE.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **BlogCatalog**, the citation is:
  > R. Zafarani and H. Liu. 2009. Social Computing Data Repository at ASU. (2009). http://socialcomputing.asu.edu

- For **Microsoft Academic Graph**, the citation is:
  > 2016. Microsoft Academic Graph - KDD cup 2016. https://doi.org/10.1145/3178876.3186

- For **CoAuthor**, the citation is:
  > Jiafeng Hu, CK Cheng, Zhipeng Huang, Yixiang Fang, and Siqiang Luo. 2017. On Embedding Uncertain Graphs. In CIKM. ACM.

- For **CoCit**, the citation is:
  > Mingdong Ou, Peng Cui, Jian Pei, Ziwei Zhang, and Wenwu Zhu. 2016. Asymmetric transitivity preserving graph embedding. In KDD. 1105a1114.

- For **VK**, the citation is:
  > Jaewon Yang and Jure Leskovec. 2015. Defining and evaluating network communities based on ground-truth. Knowledge and Information Systems 42 (2015), 181a213.

- For **YouTube**, the citation is:
  > Lei Tang and Huan Liu. 2009. Scalable learning of collective behavior based on sparse social dimensions. In CIKM. 1107a1116.

- For **Orkut**, the citation is:
  > Jaewon Yang and Jure Leskovec. 2015. Defining and evaluating network communities based on ground-truth. Knowledge and Information Systems 42 (2015), 181a213.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
