To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hypergraph Neural Networks" by Yifan Feng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the citation network classiication and visual object recognition tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional graph convolutional neural networks and the importance of incorporating high-order data correlation in a hypergraph structure. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Cora**: This dataset is used for citation network classiication.
2. **Pubmed**: This dataset is used for citation network classiication.
3. **ModelNet40**: This dataset is used for visual object recognition.
4. **NTU**: This dataset is used for visual object recognition.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P.; Namata, G.; Bilgic, M.; Getoor, L.; Galligher, B.; and Eliassi-Rad, T. *Collective Classiication in Network Data*. AI magazine, 29(3): 74–82, 2008.

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P.; Namata, G.; Bilgic, M.; Getoor, L.; Galligher, B.; and Eliassi-Rad, T. *Collective Classiication in Network Data*. AI magazine, 29(3): 74–82, 2008.

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z.; Song, S.; Khosla, A.; Yu, F.; Zhang, L.; Tang, X.; and Xiao, J. *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shape Analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2015, 4710–4718.

- For **NTU**, the citation is:
  > Chen, D.-Y.; Tian, X.-P.; Shen, Y.-T.; and Ouhyoung, M. *On Visual Similarity Based 3D Model Retrieval*. Computer Graphics Forum, 22(3), 223–232, 2003.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
