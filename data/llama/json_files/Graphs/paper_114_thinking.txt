To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating Typed Syntactic Dependencies for Targeted Sentiment Classification Using Graph Attention Neural Network" by Xuefeng Bai, Pengbo Liu, and Yue Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the task of targeted sentiment classification, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of dominant methods for targeted sentiment classification and the importance of integrating dependency syntax for the task, which hints at the use of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention four named datasets:

1. **Restaurant (Laptop) datasets of SemEval 2014**: This dataset is used for aspect-based sentiment analysis.
2. **ACL14 Twitter dataset**: This dataset is used for targeted sentiment classification.
3. **MAMS dataset**: This dataset is used for aspect-based sentiment analysis.
4. **Twitter dataset**: This dataset is used for targeted sentiment classification.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Restaurant (Laptop) datasets of SemEval 2014**, the citation is:
  > Pontiki et al. (2014) SemEval-2014 task 4: Aspect-based sentiment analysis.

- For **ACL14 Twitter dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dong et al. (2014) ACL14 Twitter sentiment classification.

- For **MAMS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jiang et al. (2019) A challengedataset and effective models for aspect-based sentiment analysis.

- For **Twitter dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kim et al. (2004) Introduction to the bio-entity recognition task at JNLPBA.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
