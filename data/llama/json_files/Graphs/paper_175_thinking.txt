To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Protein-ligand Binding Affinity Prediction with Structure-Based Deep Fusion Inference" by Derek Jones et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the PDBBind database for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of deep learning models for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction and the potential of fusion models.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **PDBBind 2016 dataset**: A curated subset of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) containing protein-ligand binding structures.
2. **PDBBind 2016 core set**: A subset of the PDBBind 2016 dataset containing 290 protein-ligand binding complexes.
3. **PDBBind 2016 general set**: A larger subset of the PDBBind 2016 dataset containing 13,308 protein-ligand binding complexes.
4. **PDBBind 2016 reined set**: A subset of the PDBBind 2016 general set containing 4,057 protein-ligand binding complexes.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PDBBind 2016 dataset**, the citation is:
  > wwPDB consortium (2019). Protein data bank: the single global archive for 3D macromolecular structure data. Nucleic Acids Res., 47(D1), D520-D528. https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky1068

- For **PDBBind 2016 core set**, the citation is:
  > wwPDB consortium (2019). Protein data bank: the single global archive for 3D macromolecular structure data. Nucleic Acids Res., 47(D1), D520-D528. https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky1068

- For **PDBBind 2016 general set**, the citation is:
  > wwPDB consortium (2019). Protein data bank: the single global archive for 3D macromolecular structure data. Nucleic Acids Res., 47(D1), D520-D528. https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky1068

- For **PDBBind 2016 reined set**, the citation is:
  > wwPDB consortium (2019). Protein data bank: the single global archive for 3D macromolecular structure data. Nucleic Acids Res., 47(D1), D520-D528. https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky1068

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
