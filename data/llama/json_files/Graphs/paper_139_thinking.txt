To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MANELA: A Multi-Agent Algorithm for Learning Network Embeddings" by Han Zhang and Hong Xu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the network embedding learning task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing network embedding learning algorithms and the importance of developing a multi-agent algorithm for learning network embeddings. They hint at the evaluation of their algorithm on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **BlogCatalog**: A network that depicts bloggers' relationships.
2. **Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI)**: A network that depicts the interaction of proteins.
3. **Wikipedia**: A co-occurrence network of words present in Wikipedia.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their algorithm, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **BlogCatalog**, the citation is:
  > L. Tang and H. Liu, *Scalable learning of collective behavior based on sparse social dimensions*, Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, 2009, pp. 1107-1116.

- For **PPI**, the citation is:
  > A. Alipanahi, A. Delong, M. T. Weirauch, and B. J. Frey, *Predicting the sequence specificity of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins by deep learning*, Nature Biotechnology, vol. 33, pp. 831-838, 2015.

- For **Wikipedia**, the citation is:
  > L. v. d. M. Maaten and G. Hinton, *Visualizing high-dimensional data using t-SNE*, Journal of Machine Learning Research, vol. 9, pp. 2579-2605, 2008.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
