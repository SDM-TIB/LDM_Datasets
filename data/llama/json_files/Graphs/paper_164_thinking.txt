To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Molecular Graph Neural Networks for Predicting Molecule Properties" by Zeren Shui and George Karypis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the molecule property prediction task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing methods and the importance of modeling many-body interactions in molecules. They hint at the evaluation of their model on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the **QM9 dataset**:

1. **QM9 dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the QM9 dataset was used for extrinsic evaluation of their model, which reinforces its relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the QM9 dataset:

- For **QM9 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ramakrishnan, P. O., Dral, P. O., Rupp, M., & Von Lilienfeld, O. A. (2014). Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules. Scientific Data, 1, 140022. https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2014.22

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset and its citation from the paper.
