To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CNN Acceleration by Low-Rank Approximation with Quantized Factors" by Nikolay Kozyrskiy and Anh-Huy Phan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of convolutional neural networks on various datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of modern convolutional neural networks and the need for compression and acceleration. They hint at the evaluation of their methods on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes.
3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale image classification dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their methods, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., & Hinton, G. E. (2012). ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) (pp. 1097-1105).

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., & Hinton, G. E. (2012). ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) (pp. 1097-1105).

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Huang, G. S., Khosla, A., Nygaard, M., & Berg, A. C. (2014). ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge. In Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) (pp. 2634-2642).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
