To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual Sound Source Localization" by Honglie Chen, Weidi Xie, Triantafyllos Afouras, Arsha Nagrani, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the visual sound source localization task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing sound localization benchmarks and the importance of developing new benchmarks for visual sound source localization. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Flickr SoundNet**: This dataset is used for sound localization tasks.
2. **VGG-Sound**: This dataset is used for visual sound source localization tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Flickr SoundNet**, the citation is:
  > Yusuf Aytar, Carl Vondrick, and Antonio Torralba. Sound-net: Learning sound representations from unlabeled video. In NeurIPS, 2016.

- For **VGG-Sound**, the citation is:
  > Honglie Chen, Weidi Xie, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman. VGG-Sound: A large-scale audio-visual dataset. In Proc. ICASSP, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
