To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Answering Conversational Questions on Structured Data without Logical Forms" by Thomas M A uller, Francesco Piccinno, Massimo Nicosia, Peter Shaw, and Yasemin Altun, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the sequential question answering task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous approaches and the importance of handling conversational context. They hint at the use of the Sequential Question Answering (SQA) dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the **Sequential Question Answering (SQA) dataset**.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the SQA dataset was used for extrinsic evaluation of their model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SQA dataset:

- For the **SQA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Iyyer et al. (2017) Search-based neural structured learning for sequential question answering.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
