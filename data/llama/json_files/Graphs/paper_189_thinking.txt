    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive and Generative Graph Convolutional Networks for Graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning" by Sheng Wan, Shirui Pan, Jian Yang, and Chen Gong, I will follow a systematic approach.

    First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the graph-based semi-supervised learning tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

    In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing graph-based semi-supervised learning methods and the importance of exploring new approaches. They hint at the evaluation of their proposed method on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

    Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

    1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset.
    2. **CiteSeer**: A citation network dataset.
    3. **PubMed**: A citation network dataset.
    4. **Amazon Computers**: A co-purchase network dataset.
    5. **Amazon Photo**: A co-purchase network dataset.
    6. **Coauthor CS**: A co-authorship network dataset.

    In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their proposed method, which reinforces their relevance.

    Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

    - For **Cora**, the citation is:
      > Sen, P.; Namata, G.; Bilgic, M.; Getoor, L.; Galligher, B.; and Eliassi-Rad, T. *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3), 2018, pp. 93–101. https://doi.org/10.1162/ajiman.2018.29.3.93

    - For **CiteSeer**, the citation is:
      > Sen, P.; Namata, G.; Bilgic, M.; Getoor, L.; Galligher, B.; and Eliassi-Rad, T. *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3), 2018, pp. 93–101. https://doi.org/10.1162/ajiman.2018.29.3.93

    - For **PubMed**, the citation is:
      > Sen, P.; Namata, G.; Bilgic, M.; Getoor, L.; Galligher, B.; and Eliassi-Rad, T. *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3), 2018, pp. 93–101. https://doi.org/10.1162/ajiman.2018.29.3.93

    - For **Amazon Computers**, the citation is:
      > Shchur, O.; Mumme, M.; Bojchevski, A.; and Gao, F. *Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868, 2018.

    - For **Amazon Photo**, the citation is:
      > Shchur, O.; Mumme, M.; Bojchevski, A.; and Gao, F. *Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868, 2018.

    - For **Coauthor CS**, the citation is:
      > Shchur, O.; Mumme, M.; Bojchevski, A.; and Gao, F. *Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868, 2018.

    After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
