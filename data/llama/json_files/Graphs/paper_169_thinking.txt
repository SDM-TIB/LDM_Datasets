To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constant Curvature Graph Convolutional Networks" by Gregor Bachmann, Gary B. Ecigneul, and Octavian-Eugen Ganea, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various graphs and datasets for node classification and distortion minimization.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of Euclidean graph convolutional networks and the potential of non-Euclidean spaces for modeling certain types of data.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three synthetic datasets:

1. **Tree dataset**: A balanced tree of depth 5 and branching factor 4 consisting of 1365 nodes and 1364 edges.
2. **Torus dataset**: A graph sampled from the unit connected square, with 1000 nodes and 30626 edges.
3. **Spherical Graph dataset**: A graph sampled from S2, with 1000 nodes and 17640 edges.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Tree dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sarkar, R. Low distortion delaunay embedding of trees in hyperbolic plane. International Symposium on Graph Drawing, pp. 355-366. Springer, 2011.

- For **Torus dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gu, A., Sala, F., Gunel, B., and Re, C. Learning mixed-curvature representations in product spaces. Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.

- For **Spherical Graph dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xu, J. and Durrett, G. Spherical latent spaces for stable In Proceedings of the 2018 variational autoencoders. Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 4503-4513, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
