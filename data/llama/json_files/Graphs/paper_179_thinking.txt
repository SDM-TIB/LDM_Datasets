To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Intention Network for Click-through Rate Prediction in Sponsored Search" by Feng Li, Zhenrui Chen, Pengjie Wang, Yi Ren, Di Zhang, and Xiaoyu Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the sponsored search task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing methods for user intention mining and the importance of capturing useras real-time search intention. They hint at the evaluation of their proposed Graph Intention Network (GIN) on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following named entity recognition corpora:

1. **Co-occurrence commodity graph**: This dataset is used for graph-based intention mining.
2. **User click behavior data**: This dataset is used for training and testing the GIN model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Co-occurrence commodity graph**, the citation is:
  > Figure 2: The graph is constructed based on user history behaviors.

- For **User click behavior data**, the citation is:
  > Figure 2: The graph is constructed based on user history behaviors.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
