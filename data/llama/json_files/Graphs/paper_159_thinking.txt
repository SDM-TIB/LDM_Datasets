    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LEARNING MOVEMENT STRATEGIES FORMOVING TARGET DEFENSE" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of movement strategies for Moving Target Defense (MTD), which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing models for MTD and the importance of developing new strategies. They hint at the evaluation of these models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Web-application security dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the effectiveness of different MTD strategies.
2. **Cloud-network security dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the effectiveness of different MTD strategies.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Web-application security dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sengupta et al. (2020) model an MTD for web-applications as a Bayesian Stackelberg Game (BSG) (22).

- For **Cloud-network security dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sengupta et al. (2019) model an MTD for cloud networks as a Markov Game (21).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
