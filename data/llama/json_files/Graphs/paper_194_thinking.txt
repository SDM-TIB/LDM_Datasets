    To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Chebyshev Basis in GraphConvolutional Networks for Skeleton-basedAction Recognition" by Hichem Sahbi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the skeleton-based action recognition task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing methods for skeleton-based action recognition and the importance of learning connectivity in graph signal processing. They hint at the evaluation of their method on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **SBU Interaction Dataset**: This dataset is used for skeleton-based action recognition.
2. **First-Person Hand Action (FPHA) Dataset**: This dataset is used for skeleton-based action recognition.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of their method.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SBU Interaction Dataset**, the citation is:
  > K. Yun, J. Honorio, D. Chattopadhyay, T.L. Berg, and D. Samaras. Two-person interaction detection using body pose features and multiple instance learning. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop, 2012.

- For **First-Person Hand Action (FPHA) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Garcia-Hernando, S. Yuan, S. Baek, and T.-K. Kim. First- Person Hand Action Benchmark with RGB-D Videos and 3D Hand Pose Annotations. In CVPR, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
