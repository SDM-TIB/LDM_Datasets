To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Graph Neural Network Approach for Detecting PHP Vulnerabilities" by Rishi Rabheru, Hazim Hanif, and Sergio Maffeis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of DeepTective on synthetic and real-world datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of evaluating DeepTective on various datasets, including SARD and GitHub datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **SARD (Software Assurance Reference Dataset)**: This dataset is used for synthetic evaluation of DeepTective.
2. **GitHub dataset**: This dataset is used for real-world evaluation of DeepTective.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of DeepTective.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SARD**, the citation is:
  > Bertrand C. Stivalet, PHP Vulnerability Test Suite Generator, [Accessed April 10, 2020].

- For **GitHub dataset**, the citation is:
  > National Institute of Standards and Technology, National Vulnerability Database, [Accessed April 10, 2020].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
