To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MODELLING DRUG-TARGET BINDING AFFINITY USING A BERT BASED GRAPH NEURAL NETWORK" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the approach on two drug-target interaction datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of drug-protein interaction simulations and the potential of deep learning methods to reduce the cost and time required to provide accurate predictions.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Davis kinase dataset**: This dataset is used for drug-target interaction prediction.
2. **KIBA dataset**: This dataset is also used for drug-target interaction prediction.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their approach.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Davis kinase dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mindy I Davis, Jeremy P Hunt, Sanna Herrgard, Pietro Ciceri, Lisa M Wodicka, Gabriel Pallares, Michael Hocker, Daniel K Treiber, and Patrick P Zarrinkar. *Comprehensive analysis of kinase inhibitor selectivity*. Nature biotechnology, 29(11):1046–1051, 2011.

- For **KIBA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jing Tang, Agnieszka Szwajda, Sushil Shakyawar, Tao Xu, Petteri Hintsanen, Krister Wennerberg, and Tero Aittokallio. *Making sense of large-scale kinase inhibitor bioactivity data sets: a comparative and integrative analysis*. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 54(3):735–743, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
