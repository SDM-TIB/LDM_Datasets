To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text Level Graphs for Text Classification" by Lianzhe Huang, Dehong Ma, Sujian Li, Xiaodong Zhang and Houfeng WANG, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the text classification task and the use of various datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of previous graph-based models and the importance of text-level graphs for text classification. They hint at the use of several datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **R8**: A text classification dataset.
2. **R52**: A text classification dataset.
3. **Ohsumed**: A text classification dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **R8**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **R52**, the citation is:
  > Not found

- For **Ohsumed**, the citation is:
  > Ohsumed corpus is extracted from MEDLINE database.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
