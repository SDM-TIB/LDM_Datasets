To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The World as a Graph:Improving El Ni Eno Forecasts with Graph Neural Networks" by Salva RA uhling Cachay et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various datasets for ENSO forecasting, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of current deep learning models for ENSO forecasting and the potential of graph neural networks (GNNs) to improve forecasting accuracy. They mention the use of the Oceanic NiEno Index (ONI) and other datasets for training and testing their model.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for training and testing. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SODA reanalysis dataset**: This dataset is used for training and testing the GNN model.
2. **CMIP5 climate model simulations**: This dataset is used for training and testing the GNN model.
3. **GODAS dataset**: This dataset is used for testing the GNN model.
4. **ONI dataset**: This dataset is used for training and testing the GNN model.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for training and testing their model, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SODA reanalysis dataset**, the citation is:
  > SODA (Smith et al., 2014)

- For **CMIP5 climate model simulations**, the citation is:
  > CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 2012)

- For **GODAS dataset**, the citation is:
  > GODAS (Rogers et al., 2016)

- For **ONI dataset**, the citation is:
  > ONI (Ropelewski & Halpert, 1987)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
