To extract datasets from the research paper titled "THE CARD SHUFFLING HYPOTHESES: BUILDING ATIME AND MEMORY EFFICIENT GRAPH CONVOLU-TIONAL NETWORK" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the 3D vision and graphics tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of state-of-the-art GCNs and the importance of designing time and memory efficient graph convolutional networks. They hint at the evaluation of these networks on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **ModelNet40**: A large-scale 3D model dataset for classification and segmentation tasks.
2. **ShapeNetPart**: A dataset for part segmentation tasks.
3. **S3DIS**: A dataset for semantic segmentation tasks.
4. **Point2Mesh**: A dataset for surface reconstruction tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Shuran Song, et al. *3D Shape Networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3459-3468, 2016.

- For **ShapeNetPart**, the citation is:
  > Angel X. Chang, et al. *Shapenet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

- For **S3DIS**, the citation is:
  > Zhirong Wu, et al. *3D SHAPENET: A Deep Learning Model for 3D Shape Analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1912-1920, 2017.

- For **Point2Mesh**, the citation is:
  > Rana Hanocka, et al. *Point2Mesh: A self-prior for deformable meshes*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.11084, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
