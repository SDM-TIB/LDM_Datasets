To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MultiVERSE: A Multiplex and Multiplex-Heterogeneous Network Embedding Approach" by Pio-Lopez, Alberto Valdeolivas, Laurent Tichit, A Elisabeth Remy, and Ana A As Baudot, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the multiplex and multiplex-heterogeneous network embedding, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing network embedding methods and the importance of multiplex and multiplex-heterogeneous network embedding. They hint at the evaluation of these methods on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CKM**: A multiplex network describing how physicians in four towns in Illinois used the new drug tetracycline.
2. **LAZEGA**: A multiplex social network composed of 3 layers based on co-working, friendship, and advice between partners and associates of a corporate law partnership.
3. **C.ELE**: A neuronal multiplex network composed of 3 layers corresponding to different synaptic junctions.
4. **ARXIV**: A multiplex network composed of 8 layers corresponding to different ArXiv categories.
5. **HOMO**: A multiplex network composed of 4 layers extracted from the original network on CoMuNe Lab.
6. **DIS**: A disease multiplex network composed of 3 layers: i) a disease-disease network based on a projection of a disease-drug network from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD).
7. **MOL**: A human molecular multiplex network consisting of 3 layers: i) a protein-protein interaction (PPI) layer, ii) a pathways layer extracted from NDEx, and iii) a molecular complexes layer constructed from the fusion of Hu.map and Corum.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their method, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CKM**, the citation is:
  > Coleman, J., Katz, E., and Menzel, H. The diffusion of an innovation among physicians. Sociometry 20, 4 (1957), 253a270.

- For **LAZEGA**, the citation is:
  > Emmanuel, L. The collegial phenomenon. the social mechanisms of cooperation among peers in a corporate law partnership, 2001.

- For **C.ELE**, the citation is:
  > Chen, B. L., Hall, D. H., and Chklovskii, D. B. Wiring optimization can relate neuronal structure and function. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 103, 12 (2006), 4723a4728.

- For **ARXIV**, the citation is:
  > De Domenico, M., Lancichinetti, A., Arenas, A., and Rosvall, M. Identifying modular iows on multilayer networks reveals highly overlapping organization in interconnected systems. Physical Review X 5, 1 (2015), 011027.

- For **HOMO**, the citation is:
  > Stark, C., Breitkreutz, B.-J., Reguly, T., Boucher, L., Breitkreutz, A., and Tyers, M. Biogrid: a general repository for interaction datasets. Nucleic acids research 34, suppl 1 (2006), D535aD539.

- For **DIS**, the citation is:
  > Davis, A. P., Grondin, C. J., Johnson, R. J., Sciaky, D., McMorran, R., Wiegers, J., Wiegers, T. C., and Mattingly, C. J. The comparative toxicogenomics database: update 2019. Nucleic acids research 47, D1 (2019), D948aD954.

- For **MOL**, the citation is:
  > Drew, K., Lee, C., Huizar, R. L., Tu, F., Borgeson, B., McWhite, C. D., Ma, Y., Wallingford, J. B., and Marcotte, E. M. Integration of over 9,000 mass spectrometry experiments builds a global map of human protein complexes. Molecular systems biology 13, 6 (2017).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
