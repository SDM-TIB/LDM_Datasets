To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Pre-training with Adversarial Fine-tuning for Zero-shot Expert Linking" by Bo Chen, Jing Zhang, Xiaokang Zhang, Xiaobin Tang, Lingfan Cai, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen, Peng Zhang, and Jie Tang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of AMiner, News, and LinkedIn datasets for expert linking tasks.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing expert linking methods and the importance of using diverse datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **AMiner**: A large academic search and mining system with over 100 million researcher profiles and 200 million papers.
2. **News**: A collection of news articles from Chinese technical platforms, with names extracted using named entity recognition (NER) tools.
3. **LinkedIn**: A dataset of LinkedIn users and their attributes, such as affiliations and skills.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **AMiner**, the citation is:
  > Tang, J., Zhang, J., Yao, L., Li, J., Zhang, L., and Su, Z. *ArnetMiner: extraction and mining of academic social networks*. In Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 990-998, 2008.

- For **News**, the citation is:
  > Not explicitly mentioned, but the authors mention using NER tools to extract names from news articles.

- For **LinkedIn**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Y., Zhang, F., Yao, P., and Tang, J. *Cosnet: connecting heterogeneous social networks with local and global consistency*. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 1485-1494, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
