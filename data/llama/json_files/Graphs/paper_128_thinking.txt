To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimization Landscape of Tucker Decomposition" by Abraham Frandsen and Rong Ge, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the Tucker decomposition and its applications, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the Tucker decomposition technique and its applications in various fields, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **TensorFaces**: A dataset of faces represented as tensors.
2. **Data compression**: A dataset related to data compression.
3. **Handwritten digits**: A dataset of handwritten digits.
4. **Word embeddings**: A dataset of word embeddings.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the Tucker decomposition technique.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **TensorFaces**, the citation is:
  > Vasilescu and Terzopoulos (2002)

- For **Data compression**, the citation is:
  > Wang and Ahuja (2004)

- For **Handwritten digits**, the citation is:
  > Savas and EldA en (2007)

- For **Word embeddings**, the citation is:
  > Frandsen and Ge (2019)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
