To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks on Link Prediction" by Xing Wang, Alexander Vinel, and others, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the benchmarking of several existing graph neural network (GNN) models on different datasets for link prediction tasks.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the link prediction task and the importance of benchmarking GNN models on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **datasets section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for benchmarking. Here, the authors mention four named datasets:

1. **Cora**: A citation network that is used as a standard benchmark dataset.
2. **CiteSeer**: Another citation network similar to Cora.
3. **PubMed**: A citation network of scientific publications pertaining to diabetes from the PubMed database.
4. **WikiCS**: A dataset based on Wikipedia article references.
