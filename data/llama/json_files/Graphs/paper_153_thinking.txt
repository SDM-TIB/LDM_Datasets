To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hypergraph Convolution and Hypergraph Attention" by Song Bai, Feihu Zhang, and Philip H.S. Torr, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the graph neural networks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing graph neural networks and the importance of handling non-pairwise relationships. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three citation network datasets:

1. **Cora dataset**: A citation network dataset containing 2,708 scientiic publications divided into 7 categories.
2. **Citeseer dataset**: A citation network dataset containing 3,327 scientiic publications divided into 6 categories.
3. **Pubmed dataset**: A citation network dataset containing 19,717 scientiic publications divided into 3 classes.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Cora dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Getoor, L., Gallagher, G., Dumoulin, V., & Shervashidze, N. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93–106.

- For **Citeseer dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Getoor, L., Gallagher, G., Dumoulin, V., & Shervashidze, N. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93–106.

- For **Pubmed dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Getoor, L., Gallagher, G., Dumoulin, V., & Shervashidze, N. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93–106.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
