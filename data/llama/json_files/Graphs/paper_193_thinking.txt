To extract datasets from the research paper titled "viXraSparse Symmetric Tensor Regression for Functional Connectivity Analysis" by Da Xu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the application of tensor regression models to brain functional connectivity analysis, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of brain functional connectivity analysis and the limitations of existing methods. They hint at the use of the Berkeley Aging Cohort Study (BACS) dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for analysis. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Berkeley Aging Cohort Study (BACS)**: This dataset is used for functional connectivity analysis.
2. **Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography (PIB-PET) imaging**: This dataset is used for AI2 deposition analysis.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for analysis.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **BACS**, the citation is:
  > Da Xu, et al. *viXraSparse Symmetric Tensor Regression for Functional Connectivity Analysis*. viXra, 2020.

- For **PIB-PET**, the citation is:
  > Da Xu, et al. *Functional connectivity analysis of Alzheimer's disease using Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography*. Alzheimer's & Dementia, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
