To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Learning on Attributed Graphs via Graph Cognizant Logistic Regression and Preemptive Query Generation" by Florence Regola et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the node classification task on attributed graphs, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing active learning methods for attributed graphs and the importance of node classification tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention five named datasets:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset.
2. **Citeseer**: A citation network dataset.
3. **Pubmed**: A citation network dataset.
4. **Am-comp**: A co-purchase history dataset.
5. **Am-photo**: A co-purchase history dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Shchur et al. (2018) Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation.

- For **Citeseer**, the citation is:
  > Shchur et al. (2018) Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation.

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is:
  > Shchur et al. (2018) Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation.

- For **Am-comp**, the citation is:
  > Roy and McCallum (2001)

- For **Am-photo**, the citation is:
  > Roy and McCallum (2001)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
