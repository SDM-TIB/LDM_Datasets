To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised temporal learning for video representation" by Anonymous authors, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for videos, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of spatial-level self-supervised learning for videos and the importance of learning temporal representations.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **UCF101**: A large dataset containing 101 human action classes.
2. **HMDB51**: A relatively small dataset containing 51 human action classes.
3. **Kinetics-400**: A large-scale action recognition dataset with 400 classes.
4. **K-400**: A subset of Kinetics-400 used for pre-training.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A Dataset of 101 Human Actions Classes from Videos in the Wild*. Journal of Visual Effects, 36(2), 2012.

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:
  > Hildegard Kuehne, Hueihan Jhuang, EstA Abaliz Garrote, Tomaso Poggio, and Thomas Serre. *HMDB: A Large Video Dataset for Human Motion Recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2011.

- For **Kinetics-400**, the citation is:
  > Carreira and Zisserman (2017).

- For **K-400**, the citation is:
  > Carreira and Zisserman (2017).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
