To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Global Self-attention Mechanism for Graph Convolutional Networks" by Chen Wang and Chengyuan Deng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the Global Self-attention mechanism on multiple benchmark datasets, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the similarity between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), and the potential of applying the Global Self-attention mechanism to GCNs.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three benchmark datasets:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset.
2. **Citeseer**: A citation network dataset.
3. **Pubmed**: A citation network dataset.
4. **COIL-RAG**: A graph classification dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation of the Global Self-attention mechanism on GCNs.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Thomas N Kipf and Max Welling. Semi-supervised classiication with graph convolutional networks. arXivpreprint arXiv:1609.02907, 2016.

- For **Citeseer**, the citation is:
  > Thomas N Kipf and Max Welling. Semi-supervised classiication with graph convolutional networks. arXivpreprint arXiv:1609.02907, 2016.

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is:
  > Thomas N Kipf and Max Welling. Semi-supervised classiication with graph convolutional networks. arXivpreprint arXiv:1609.02907, 2016.

- For **COIL-RAG**, the citation is:
  > Asma Atamna, Nataliya Sokolovska, and Jean-Claude crivello. SPI-GCN: A Simple Permutation-Invariant GraphConvolutional Network. Apr 2019. preprint, HAL hal-02093451.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
