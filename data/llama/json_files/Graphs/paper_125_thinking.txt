To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks: Make the CommunityDetection Much Better" by Yaping Zheng, Shiyi Chen, Xinni Zhang, Xiaofeng Zhang, Xiaofei YANG, and Di Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the community detection task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing community detection approaches and the importance of addressing the challenges of heterogeneous and temporal graphs. They hint at the evaluation of their proposed HTGCN model on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two real-world datasets:

1. **DBLP**: A citation network dataset.
2. **IMDB**: A movie dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their HTGCN model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DBLP**, the citation is:
  > Yaping Zheng, Shiyi Chen, Xinni Zhang, Xiaofeng Zhang, Xiaofei YANG, and Di Wang. Heterogeneous-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks: Make the CommunityDetection Much Better. (no specific citation number provided)

- For **IMDB**, the citation is:
  > Not mentioned in the paper

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
