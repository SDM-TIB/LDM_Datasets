To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structure-Augmented Text Representation Learning for Efficient Knowledge Graph Completion" by Bo Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the link prediction task for knowledge graph completion, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of prevalent graph embedding approaches and the importance of textual encoding approaches for knowledge graph completion. They hint at the evaluation of these approaches on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named datasets:

1. **WN18RR**: A link prediction dataset from WordNet.
2. **FB15k-237**: A link prediction dataset from Freebase.
3. **UMLS**: A small knowledge graph containing medical semantic entities and their relations.
4. **NELL-One**: A few-shot link prediction dataset derived from NELL.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WN18RR**, the citation is:
  > Nathani et al. (2019) Learning Attention-based Embeddings for Relation Prediction in Knowledge Graphs.

- For **FB15k-237**, the citation is:
  > Toutanova et al. (2015) Representing Text for Joint Embedding of Text and Knowledge Bases.

- For **UMLS**, the citation is:
  > Yao et al. (2019) KG-BERT: BERT for Knowledge Graph Completion.

- For **NELL-One**, the citation is:
  > Xiong et al. (2018) One-Shot Relational Learning for Knowledge Graphs.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
