To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph-based neural network models with multiple self-supervised auxiliary tasks" by Franco Manessi, Alessandro Rozza, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The introduction mentions the use of standard semi-supervised graph classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **methods section**, the authors mention three named datasets:

1. **Citeseer**: A citation network dataset.
2. **Cora**: A citation network dataset.
3. **Pubmed**: A citation network dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Citeseer**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI magazine, 29(3), 93–101.

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI magazine, 29(3), 93–101.

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI magazine, 29(3), 93–101.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
