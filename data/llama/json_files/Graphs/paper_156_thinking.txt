To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Contrastive Learning of Audio-Visual Video Representation" by Shuang Ma, Zhaoyang Zhang, Daniel McDuff, and Yale Song, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for audio-visual video data, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of contrastive learning and the importance of building a large and consistent dictionary across mini-batches. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various downstream tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **UCF101**: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild.
2. **HMDB51**: A dataset of 51 human actions classes from videos in the wild.
3. **ESC50**: A dataset of 50 environmental sound classes from audio files.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > Soomro et al. (2012) UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild.

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:
  > Kuehne et al. (2011) HMDB: A large video dataset for human motion recognition.

- For **ESC50**, the citation is:
  > Piczak (2015) ESC: Dataset for environmental sound classification.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
