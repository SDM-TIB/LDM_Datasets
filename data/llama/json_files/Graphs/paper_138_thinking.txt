To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OPENDrug repurposing for COVID-19 using graph neural network and harmonizing multiple evidence" by Kanglin Hsieh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of CTDbase and DRKG for drug repurposing, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of drug repurposing for COVID-19 treatment and mention CTDbase as a resource for systematic integration of accumulated COVID-19 knowledge.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. Here, the authors mention:

1. **CTDbase**: A curated list of potential COVID-19 therapeutics.
2. **DRKG**: A general biomedical knowledge graph that includes 15 million edges across 39 different types connecting drugs, disease, genes, and pathways.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for drug repurposing and validation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CTDbase**, the citation is:
  > https://www.ctdbase.org/

- For **DRKG**, the citation is:
  > https://github.com/yejinjkim/drug-repurposing-graph

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
