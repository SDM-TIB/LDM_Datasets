To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining Predictions of Graph Convolutional Networks" by Hirotaka Akita et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the Tox21 dataset and the ESOL dataset for evaluating the proposed method.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing methods for visualizing the importance of nodes in graph-structured data.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **Tox21 dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method for visualizing the importance of nodes in graph-structured data.
2. **ESOL dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method for visualizing the importance of nodes in graph-structured data.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their method.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Tox21 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ruili Huang, Menghang Xia, Dac-Trung Nguyen, Tongan Zhao, Srilatha Saka-muru, Jinghua Zhao, Sampada A Shahane, Anna Rossoshek, and Anton Simeonov. *Tox21 challenge to build predictive models of nuclear receptor and stress response pathways as mediated by exposure to environmental chemicals and drugs*. Frontiers in Environmental Science, 3:85, 2016. https://doi.org/10.3389/fenv.2016.00085

- For **ESOL dataset**, the citation is:
  > John S. Delaney. *ESOL: Estimating aqueous solubility directly from molecular structure*. Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences, 44(3):1000â€“1005, 2004. https://doi.org/10.1021/ci034221y

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
