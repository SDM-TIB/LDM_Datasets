To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLUTRR: A Diagnostic Benchmark for Inductive Reasoning from Text" by Koustuv Sinha et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the introduction of a diagnostic benchmark suite, CLUTRR, to test the systematic generalization and inductive reasoning capabilities of NLU systems.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing NLU systems and the need for a benchmark that can precisely test a model's ability for systematic generalization.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **CLUTRR dataset**: This dataset contains semi-synthetic stories involving hypothetical families, where the goal is to infer the relationship between two family members, whose relationship is not explicitly mentioned in the story.
2. **Relation Networks (RN) dataset**: This dataset is used as a baseline for comparison with CLUTRR.
3. **Compositional Attention Networks (MAC) dataset**: This dataset is also used as a baseline for comparison with CLUTRR.
4. **BERT dataset**: This dataset is used as a baseline for comparison with CLUTRR.
5. **Graph Attention Network (GAT) dataset**: This dataset is used as a baseline for comparison with CLUTRR.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CLUTRR**, the citation is:
  > Koustuv Sinha, Shagun Sodhani, Jin Dong, Joelle Pineau, and William L. Hamilton. *CLUTRR: A Diagnostic Benchmark for Inductive Reasoning from Text*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.09341 (2019).

- For **Relation Networks (RN)**, the citation is:
  > Adam Santoro, Ryan Faulkner, David Raposo, Jack Rae, Mike Chrzanowski, Theophane Weber, Daan Wierstra, Oriol Vinyals, Razvan Pascanu, and Timothy Lillicrap. *Relational recurrent neural networks*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 7310-7321 (2018).

- For **Compositional Attention Networks (MAC)**, the citation is:
  > Drew Arad Hudson and Christopher D. Manning. *Compositional attention networks for machine reasoning*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (2018).

- For **BERT**, the citation is:
  > Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, and Kristina Toutanova. *BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.04805 (2018).

- For **Graph Attention Network (GAT)**, the citation is:
  > Petar Veličković, Guillem Cucurull, Adrien Balduff, Arantxa Casanova, Adriana Romero, Pietro Lió, and Yoshua Bengio. *Graph attention networks*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (2018).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
