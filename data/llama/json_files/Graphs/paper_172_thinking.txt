To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-Contrastive Federated Learning" by Qinbin Li, Bingsheng He, and Dawn Song, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of models on various image classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of federated learning and the importance of addressing non-IID data distributions among parties. They hint at the evaluation of their proposed MOON framework on various datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention three named datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset for image classification tasks.
2. **CIFAR-100**: A dataset for image classification tasks.
3. **Tiny-Imagenet**: A dataset for image classification tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their MOON framework, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., & Hinton, G. E. (2012). ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) (pp. 1097-1105).

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., & Hinton, G. E. (2012). ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) (pp. 1097-1105).

- For **Tiny-Imagenet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) (pp. 2482-2489).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
