To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Similarity Graph Neural Network on Electronic Health Records" by Zheng Liu, Xiaohan Li, Hao Peng, Lifang He, and Philip S. Yu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the diagnosis prediction task on the MIMIC-III dataset, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of learning effective representations for medical codes and patients in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). They mention that EHRs contain multiple kinds of medical codes and relations, and can be viewed as a heterogeneous graph.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the MIMIC-III dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that the MIMIC-III dataset was used for diagnosis prediction task.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset:

- For **MIMIC-III**, the citation is:
  > A. L. Goldberger, L. A. Amaral, L. Glass, J. M. Hausdorff, P. C. Ivanov, R. G. Mark, J. E. Mietus, G. B. Moody, C.-K. Peng, and H. E. Stanley. *PhysioBank, physiotoolkit, and physionet: components of a new research resource for complex physiologic signals*. Circulation, vol. 101, no. 23, pp. e215-e220, 2000.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
