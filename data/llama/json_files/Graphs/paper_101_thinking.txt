To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cognitive Graph for Multi-Hop Reading Comprehension at Scale" by Ming Ding, Chang Zhou, Qibin Chen, Hongxia Yang, and Jie Tang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for the multi-hop reading comprehension task, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional QA systems and the importance of multi-hop reasoning. They hint at the evaluation of their model on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **HotpotQA**: A dataset for multi-hop question answering.
2. **SQuAD**: A dataset for single-hop question answering.
3. **DrQA**: A dataset for single-hop question answering.
4. **MultiQA**: A dataset for multi-hop question answering.
5. **HotpotQA (fullwiki setting)**: A dataset for multi-hop question answering with a large corpus of Wikipedia documents.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their model, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **HotpotQA**, the citation is:
  > Zhilin Yang, Peng Qi, Saizheng Zhang, Yoshua Benioff, William Cohen, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and Christopher D Manning. *Hotpotqa: A dataset for diverse, explainable multi-hop question answering*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2369a2380.

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar, P., Jia, R., Liu, K., Jiang, Y., Nelson, J., Zeng, Z.,... & Dyer, C. (2016). SQuAD: 100,000+ questions from a new SQuAD v2.0 benchmark for question answering. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383a2392.

- For **DrQA**, the citation is:
  > Chen, D., Fisch, A., Weston, J., & Bordes, A. (2017). Reading Wikipedia to answer open In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (CoNLL), pages 70â€“75.

- For **MultiQA**, the citation is:
  > Kumar, A., Irsoy, O., Ondruska, P., Iyer, M., Bradbury, J., Gulrajani, I.,... & Socher, R. (2016). Ask me anything: Dynamic memory networks for natural language processing. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 1378a1387.

- For **HotpotQA (fullwiki setting)**, the citation is:
  > Yang, Z., Qi, P., Zhang, S., Benioff, Y., Cohen, W., Salakhutdinov, R., & Manning, C. D. (2018). Hotpotqa: A dataset for diverse, explainable multi-hop question answering. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2369a2380.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
