To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised visual representation learning" by Ali Varamesh, Ali Diba, Tinne Tuytelaars, and Luc Van Gool, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the optimization and comparison of representations for self-supervised visual representation learning, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of contrastive learning and the importance of using a ranking objective for self-supervised representation learning. They hint at the evaluation of their models on various datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention two named datasets:

1. **STL10**: A dataset used for unsupervised feature learning.
2. **MS-COCO**: A large-scale image dataset used for object detection and image classification tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for extrinsic evaluation of their models, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **STL10**, the citation is:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning. In Proceedings of the fourteenth international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics, pages 215a223, 2011.

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollAr, and C Lawrence Zitnick. Microsoft coco: Common objects in context. In European conference on computer vision, pages 740a755, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
